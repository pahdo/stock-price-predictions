Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  This report includes forward-looking statements.  These forward-looking statements are identified as any statement that does not relate strictly to historical or current facts.  They use words such as  anticipate,   believe,   intend,   plan,   projection,   forecast,   strategy,   position,   continue,   estimate,   expect,   may,  or the negative of those terms or other variations of them or comparable terminology.  In particular, expressed or implied statements concerning future actions, conditions or events, future operating results or the ability to generate sales, income or cash flow or to pay dividends are forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance.  They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions.  Future actions, conditions or events and future results of operations may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.  Many of the factors that will determine these results are beyond our ability to control or predict.   
    
  See  Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  and Part I, Item 1A.   Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (  2015   Form 10-K) and Item 1A  Risk Factors  included elsewhere in this report for a more detailed description of factors that may affect the forward-looking statements.  You should keep these risk factors in mind when considering forward-looking statements.  These risk factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.  Because of these risks and uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement.  We plan to provide updates to projections included in this report when we believe previously disclosed projections no longer have a reasonable basis.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

1.  General 
    
  Organization 
    
  We are the largest energy infrastructure company in America.  We own an interest in or operate approximately   84,000   miles of pipelines and   180   terminals.  Our pipelines transport natural gas, refined petroleum products, crude oil, condensate, CO   2    and other products, and our terminals transload and store petroleum products, ethanol and chemicals, and handle such products as coal, petroleum coke and steel.  We are also the leading producer and transporter of CO   2   , which is utilized for enhanced oil recovery projects in North America. 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  General 
    
  Our reporting currency is U.S. dollars, and all references to dollars are U.S. dollars, unless stated otherwise.  Our accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  These rules and regulations conform to the accounting principles contained in the FASB s Accounting Standards Codification, the single source of GAAP.  Under such rules and regulations, all significant intercompany items have been eliminated in consolidation.  
    
  In our opinion, all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature, considered necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position and operating results for the interim periods have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, and certain amounts from prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.  Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year; accordingly, you should read these consolidated financial statements in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our   2015   Form 10-K. 
    
  Impairments and Divestitures 
    
  During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded non-cash pre-tax losses on impairments and divestitures netting to   $76 million   and   $307 million  , respectively.  The three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 included (i) an   $84 million   loss on the sale of a   50%   interest in our SNG natural gas pipeline system; (ii) losses of   $1 million   and   $9 million  , respectively, on a held-for-sale Transmix facility within our Products Pipelines business segment; and (iii) a   $9 million   net gain and a   $3 million   net loss, respectively, on other asset disposals.  The nine months ended September 30, 2016 also included (i)   $106 million   of project write-offs on our Northeast Energy Direct (NED) Market project within our Natural Gas Pipelines business segment; (ii) a   $21 million   project write-off within our CO   2    business segment; (iii) a   $20 million   impairment related to certain terminals with significant coal operations within our Terminals business segment; and (iv)   $64 million   of write-offs associated with our Palmetto project within our Products Pipelines business segment. The project write-offs recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were driven by management's assessment of the probability of those projects moving forward based on insufficient progress in obtaining contractual commitments from customers in the New England market, in the case of the NED Market project, and an unfavorable action by the Georgia legislature regarding permitting for refined products pipelines affecting the Palmetto project.   
    
  During the three and   nine months ended September 30,   2015, we recorded non-cash pre-tax losses on impairments and  divestitures netting to   $385 million   and   $489 million  , respectively.  These amounts include (i)   $99 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of impairments and project write-offs related to certain gas gathering and processing assets within our midstream operations of our Natural Gas Pipelines business segment; (ii)   $388 million   and   $397 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, within our CO   2    business segment primarily related to our Goldsmith oil and gas field, primarily driven by a decrease in commodity prices; and (iii)   $3 million   and   $7 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, of net gains on other asset disposals. 
    
  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded   $350 million   and   $344 million  , respectively, of non-cash pre-tax net losses on impairments and divestitures of equity investments, primarily related to an impairment of our equity investment in MEP within our Natural Gas Pipelines business segment.  Based on commercial discussions during the third quarter of 2016 with current and potential shippers on MEP regarding the outlook for long-term transportation contract rates, we concluded the fair value of our investment was other than temporarily impaired, thereby resulting in a write-down of  
  
   9 

our investment.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded   $26 million   non-cash pre-tax losses on impairments of equity investments in certain gas gathering operations within our Natural Gas Pipelines business segment. 
    
  As conditions warrant, we routinely evaluate our assets for potential triggering events that could impact the fair value of certain assets or our ability to recover the carrying value of long-lived assets.  Such assets include accounts receivable, equity investments, goodwill, other intangibles and property, plant and equipment, including oil and gas properties and in-process construction.  Depending on the nature of the asset, these evaluations require the use of significant judgments including but not limited to judgments related to customer credit worthiness, future cash flow estimates, future volume and long-term contract rate expectations, current and future commodity prices, regulatory environment, management s decisions to dispose of certain assets and estimates of the fair values of our reporting units, as well as general economic conditions and the related demand for products handled or transported by our assets. For example, to the extent future commodity prices are significantly lower than current market expectations and thereby unfavorably affect our customers  investment decisions, we may identify additional triggering events that may require future evaluations of the recoverability of the carrying value of our long-lived assets, investments, and goodwill which could result in further impairment charges.  Because certain of our assets, including our oil and gas producing properties, have been written down to fair value, any deterioration in fair value that exceeds the rate of depletion of the related asset would result in further impairments.  Such non-cash impairments could have a significant effect on our results of operations, which would be recognized in the period in which the carrying value is determined to not be recoverable.  Certain of these impairments are based on Level 3 estimates of fair value using income approach valuation methodologies which include assumptions regarding commodity prices, future cash flows, terminal values and discount rates.  We believe our methodologies are standard techniques and results would not vary materially using a reasonable range of assumptions. 
    
  In the fourth quarter 2015, we recorded a   $1,150 million   impairment of goodwill associated with our Natural Gas Pipeline - Non-Regulated reporting unit triggered by decreases in market valuations in our industry which were caused by the commodity price environment at that time.  Our May 31, 2016 annual goodwill impairment test indicated our remaining goodwill is recoverable, and no event indicating a goodwill impairment has occurred subsequent to that date. 
    
  We expect that the carrying value of our Natural Gas Pipelines - Non-Regulated reporting unit will continue to approximate fair value so long as our estimate of future cash flows and the market valuation remain consistent with current levels.  A prolonged period of lower commodity prices could result in further deterioration of market multiples, comparable sales transactions prices, weighted average costs of capital, and our cash flow estimates.  Unfavorable changes to any one or combination of these factors, particularly for our Natural Gas Pipelines - Non-Regulated reporting unit, would result in a change to the reporting unit fair values which could lead to further impairment charges.  Such potential impairment could have a significant effect on our results of operations. 
    
  Earnings per Share 
    
  We calculate earnings per share using the two-class method.  Earnings were allocated to Class P shares of common stock and participating securities based on the amount of dividends paid in the current period plus an allocation of the undistributed earnings or excess distributions over earnings to the extent that each security participates in earnings or excess distributions over earnings.  Our unvested restricted stock awards, which may be stock or stock units issued to management employees and include dividend equivalent payments, do not participate in excess distributions over earnings.  

10 

The following tables set forth the allocation of net income available to shareholders of Class P shares and participating securities and the reconciliation of Basic Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding to Diluted Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding (in millions): 

________ 
           (a) 
    As of    September 30, 2016  , there were approximately   9 million   such restricted stock awards. 
       
  The following maximum number of potential common stock equivalents are antidilutive and, accordingly, are excluded from the determination of diluted earnings per share (in millions on a weighted-average basis): 

_______ 
  n/a - not applicable 
  (a)   Each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of our common stock for an exercise price of   $40   per share, payable in cash or by cashless exercise, at any time until May 25, 2017.  The potential dilutive effect of the warrants does not consider the assumed proceeds to KMI upon exercise. 
  (b)   Until our mandatory convertible preferred shares are converted to common shares, on or before the expected mandatory conversion date of October 26, 2018, the holder of each preferred share participates in our earnings by receiving preferred dividends. 

2.  Acquisitions and Divestiture 
    
  Acquisition of Terminal Assets from and Joint Venture With BP Products North America Inc. (BP) 
    
  On February 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of   15   products terminals and associated infrastructure from BP for   $349 million  , including a transaction deposit paid in 2015 and working capital adjustments paid in 2016.  In conjunction with this transaction, we and BP formed a joint venture, with an equity ownership interest of   75%   and   25%  , respectively. Subsequent to the acquisition, we contributed   14   of the acquired terminals to the joint venture, which we operate, and the remaining terminal is solely owned by us.  BP acquired its   25%   interest in the joint venture for   $84 million  , which we reported as  Contributions from noncontrolling interests  within our accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  Of the acquired assets,   10   terminals are included in our Terminals business segment and   5   terminals are included in our Products Pipelines business segment based on synergies with each segment s respective existing operations. 

11 

Allocation of Purchase Price 
    
  The evaluation of the assigned fair values for the BP terminals acquisition is ongoing and subject to adjustment.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our preliminary allocation of the purchase price for the BP terminals acquisition and the adjusted purchase price allocations for the Hiland acquisition and Royal Vopak terminals acquisition, both completed in February 2015, are detailed below (in millions). 

_______ 
           (a) 
    Primarily consists of customer contracts and relationships with a weighted average amortization period of   16.4 years  . 
       
  After measuring all of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value on the acquisition date, goodwill is an intangible asset representing the future economic benefits expected to be derived from an acquisition that are not assigned to other identifiable, separately recognizable assets.  We believe the primary items that generated our goodwill are both the value of the synergies created between the acquired assets and our pre-existing assets, and our expected ability to grow the business we acquired by leveraging our pre-existing business experience.  We apply a look through method of recording deferred income taxes on the outside book-tax basis differences in our investments.  As a result, no deferred income taxes are recorded associated with non-deductible goodwill recorded at the investee level. 
    
  Sale of Equity Interest in SNG 
    
  On September 1, 2016, we completed the sale of a   50%   interest in our SNG natural gas pipeline system to The Southern Company (Southern Company), receiving proceeds of   $1.4 billion  , and the formation of a joint venture, which includes our remaining   50%   interest in SNG.  We used the proceeds from the sale to reduce outstanding debt (see Note 3).  We recognized a pre-tax loss of   $84 million   on the sale of our interest in SNG which is included within  Loss on impairments and divestitures, net  on the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  As a result of this transaction, we no longer hold a controlling interest in SNG or Bear Creek Storage Company, LLC (Bear Creek) (  50%   of which is owned by SNG) and, as such, we now account for our remaining equity interests in SNG and Bear Creek as equity investments. 

12 

3. Debt  
    
  We classify our debt based on the contractual maturity dates of the underlying debt instruments.  We defer costs associated with debt issuance over the applicable term.  These costs are then amortized as interest expense in our accompanying consolidated statements of income.  
    
   The following table provides detail on the principal amount of our outstanding debt balances.  The table amounts exclude all debt fair value adjustments, including debt discounts, premiums and issuance costs (in millions): 

_______ 
           (a) 
    On January 26, 2016, we entered into a   $1.0 billion     three  -year unsecured term loan facility with a variable interest rate, which is determined in the same manner as interest on our revolving credit facility borrowings.  In January 2016, we repaid   $850 million   of maturing   5.70%   senior notes, and in February 2016, we repaid   $250 million   of maturing   8.00%   senior notes primarily using proceeds from the three-year term loan.  Since we refinanced a portion of the maturing debt with proceeds from long-term debt, we classified   $1 billion   of the maturing debt within  Long-term debt  on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. 
              (b) 
    Amount includes senior notes that are denominated in Euros and have been converted and are respectively reported above at the   September 30, 2016   exchange rate of   1.1235   U.S. dollars per Euro and the December 31, 2015 exchange rate of   1.0862   U.S. dollars per Euro.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our debt balance increased by   $47 million   as a result of the change in the exchange rate of U.S. dollars per Euro.  The increase in debt due to the changes in exchange rates is offset by a corresponding change in the value of cross-currency swaps reflected in  Deferred charges and other assets   and   Other long-term liabilities and deferred credits  on our consolidated balance sheets.  At the time of issuance, we entered into cross-currency swap agreements associated with these senior notes, effectively converting these Euro-denominated senior notes to U.S. dollars (see Note 5  Risk Management   Foreign Currency Risk Management   ). 
              (c) 
    On September 30, 2016, we repaid the   $332 million   principal amount of   7.125%   senior notes due 2021, plus accrued interest.  We recognized a   $28.3 million   gain from the     early extinguishment of debt, included within  Interest, net  on the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisting of an   $11.8 million   premium on the debt repaid and a   $40.1 million   gain from the write-off of unamortized purchase accounting associated with the extinguished debt.  Copano continues to be a subsidiary guarantor under a cross guarantee agreement (see Note 11). 
              (d) 
    On   August 16, 2016  , CIG completed a private offering of   $375 million   in principal amount of   4.15%   senior notes due August 15, 2026.  The net proceeds of   $372 million   received from the offering were used to reduce debt incurred as the result of the repayment of CIG s senior notes that matured in 2015 and for general corporate purposes. 
              (e) 
    Due to the September 1, 2016 sale of a   50%   interest in SNG, we no longer consolidate SNG s accounts in our consolidated financial statements.  As of the transaction date, SNG had   $1,211 million   of debt outstanding (including a current portion of   $500 million  ). 
     
   13 

(f) 
    Amounts include outstanding credit facility borrowings, commercial paper borrowings and other debt maturing within 12 months (see   Current Portion of Debt  below). 
              (g) 
    Excludes our  Debt fair value adjustments  which, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , increased our combined debt balances by   $1,710 million   and   $1,674 million  , respectively.  In addition to all unamortized debt discount/premium amounts, debt issuance costs and purchase accounting on our debt balances, our debt fair value adjustments also include amounts associated with the offsetting entry for hedged debt and any unamortized portion of proceeds received from the early termination of interest rate swap agreements. 
       
  We and substantially all of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries are a party to a cross guarantee agreement whereby each party to the agreement unconditionally guarantees, jointly and severally, the payment of specified indebtedness of each other party to the agreement.  Also, see Note 11. 
    
  Credit Facilities  
    
  On January 26, 2016, in accordance with the terms of our revolving credit agreement, we increased the capacity of our revolving credit agreement from   $4.0 billion   to   $5.0 billion  .  The other terms of the revolving credit agreement remain the same.  Our availability under this facility as of   September 30, 2016   was   $4,832 million  , which is net of   $168 million   in letters of credit.  Borrowings under our revolving credit facility can be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes and as a backup to our commercial paper program.  Borrowings under our commercial paper program reduce the borrowings allowed under our credit facility.   
    
  Current Portion of Debt 
  In addition to outstanding credit facility borrowings, commercial paper borrowings, and other debt maturing within 12 months, our current portion of debt includes the current portion of the following significant series of long-term notes:  

Long-term Debt Issuances, Repayments and Other Significant Changes in Debt 
  The following are significant long-term debt issuances, repayments and other significant changes made during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

Subsequent Event 
  On October 1, 2016, a portion of the proceeds from the sale of a   50%   interest in SNG was used to repay the   $749 million   principal amount of Hiland s   7.25%   senior notes due 2020, plus accrued interest.  As of September 30, 2016, funds for this early extinguishment were held in escrow as a restricted deposit and included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  
  
   14 

within  Restricted deposits.   As of September 30, 2016, we classified the   $749 million   of senior notes as  Current portion of debt  within the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. 
   
  4.  Stockholders  Equity 
    
  Common Equity 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our common equity consisted of our Class P common stock.  For additional information regarding our Class P common stock, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in our   2015   Form 10-K.  
    
  Common Dividends 
    
  Holders of our common stock participate in any dividend declared by our board of directors, subject to the rights of the holders of any outstanding preferred stock.  The following table provides information about our per share dividends:   

On   October 19, 2016  , our board of directors declared a cash dividend of   $0.125   per common share for the quarterly period ended   September 30, 2016  , which is payable on   November 15, 2016   to common shareholders of record as of November 1, 2016. 
    
  Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock 
    
  On October 30, 2015, we completed an offering of   32,000,000   depositary shares, each of which represents a 1/20th interest in a share of our   1,600,000   shares of   9.750%   Series A mandatory convertible preferred stock, with a liquidating preference of   $1,000   per share (equal to a   $50   liquidation preference per depositary share).  For additional information regarding our mandatory convertible preferred stock, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in our   2015   Form 10-K.  
    
  Preferred  Dividends    
    
  On July 20, 2016, our board of directors declared a cash dividend of   $24.375   per share of our mandatory convertible preferred stock (equivalent of   $1.21875   per depositary share) for the period from and including July 26, 2016 through and including October 25, 2016, which is payable on October 26, 2016 to mandatory convertible preferred shareholders of record as of October 11, 2016. 

5.  Risk Management  
    
  Certain of our business activities expose us to risks associated with unfavorable changes in the market price of natural gas, NGL and crude oil.  We also have exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk as a result of the issuance of our debt obligations.  Pursuant to our management s approved risk management policy, we use derivative contracts to hedge or reduce our exposure to certain of these risks.  In addition, prior to May 2016, we had power forward and swap contracts related to legacy operations of acquired businesses. 

15 

Energy Commodity Price Risk Management 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had the following outstanding commodity forward contracts to hedge our forecasted energy commodity purchases and sales:  
                         
    Net open position long/(short)

As of   September 30, 2016  , the maximum length of time over which we have hedged, for accounting purposes, our exposure to the variability in future cash flows associated with energy commodity price risk is through December 2020.  
    
  Interest Rate Risk Management 
    
   As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a combined notional principal amount of   $9,775 million   of fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements, all of which were designated as fair value hedges.  As of   December 31, 2015  , we had a combined notional principal amount of   $11,000 million   of fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements, of which   $9,700   million were designated as fair value hedges.  All of our swap agreements effectively convert the interest expense associated with certain series of senior notes from fixed rates to variable rates based on an interest rate of London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread and have termination dates that correspond to the maturity dates of the related series of senior notes.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the maximum length of time over which we have hedged a portion of our exposure to the variability in the value of this debt due to interest rate risk is through March 15, 2035.   
    
  Foreign Currency Risk Management 
    
  In connection with the issuance of our Euro denominated senior notes in March 2015 (see Note 3), we entered into   $1,358 million   cross-currency swap agreements to manage the related foreign currency risk by effectively converting all of the fixed-rate Euro denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to U.S. dollar denominated debt at fixed rates equivalent to approximately   3.79%   and   4.67%   for the   7  -year and   12  -year senior notes, respectively.  These cross-currency swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges.  The terms of the cross-currency swap agreements correspond to the related hedged senior notes, and such agreements have the same maturities as the hedged senior notes.

_____ 
           (a) 
    We expect to reclassify an approximate   $49 million   gain associated with cash flow hedge price risk management activities included in our accumulated other comprehensive loss balances as of   September 30, 2016   into earnings during the next twelve months (when the associated forecasted sales and purchases are also expected to occur), however, actual amounts reclassified into earnings could vary materially as a result of changes in market prices.  
              (b) 
    Amounts reclassified were the result of the hedged forecasted transactions actually affecting earnings (i.e., when the forecasted sales and purchases actually occurred). 
              (c) 
    Amounts represent our share of an equity investee s accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
     
   18 

_______ 
  (a)  Three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   includes an approximate gain of   $20 million   and   $59 million  , respectively, associated with natural gas, crude and NGL derivative contract settlements.  Three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   includes an approximate gain of   $19 million   and   $21 million  , respectively, associated with natural gas, crude and NGL derivative contract settlements. 
    
  Credit Risks 
  In conjunction with certain derivative contracts, we are required to provide collateral to our counterparties, which may include posting letters of credit or placing cash in margin accounts.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   no   and   $2 million  , respectively, of outstanding letters of credit supporting our commodity price risk management program.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had cash margins of   $16 million   posted by us as collateral and   no   amounts posted by our counterparties as collateral.  As of December 31, 2015, we had   no   cash margins posted by us as collateral and cash margins of   $37 million   posted by our counterparties as collateral.  We also use industry standard commercial agreements which allow for the netting of exposures associated with transactions executed under a single commercial agreement.  Additionally, we generally utilize master netting agreements to offset credit exposure across multiple commercial agreements with a single counterparty. 
    
  We also have agreements with certain counterparties to our derivative contracts that contain provisions requiring the posting of additional collateral upon a decrease in our credit rating.  As of   September 30, 2016  , based on our current mark to market positions and posted collateral, we estimate that if our credit rating were downgraded   one   or   two   notches, we would not be required to post additional collateral.  

19 

Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
  Cumulative revenues, expenses, gains and losses that under GAAP are included within our comprehensive income but excluded from our earnings are reported as  Accumulated other comprehensive loss  within  Stockholders  Equity  in our consolidated balance sheets.  Changes in the components of our  Accumulated other comprehensive loss  not including non-controlling interests are summarized as follows (in millions): 

6.  Fair Value   
    
  The fair values of our financial instruments are separated into three broad levels (Levels 1, 2 and 3) based on our assessment of the availability of observable market data and the significance of non-observable data used to determine fair value.  Each fair value measurement must be assigned to a level corresponding to the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.   
    
  The three broad levels of inputs defined by the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 
             
    Level 1 Inputs quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date; 
                
    Level 2 Inputs inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.  If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and 
                
    Level 3 Inputs unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.  These unobservable inputs reflect the entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (which might include the reporting entity s own data). 

20 

Fair Value of Derivative Contracts 
    
  The following two tables summarize the fair value measurements of our (i) energy commodity derivative contracts; (ii) interest rate swap agreements; and (iii) cross-currency swap agreements, based on the three levels established by the Codification (in millions).  The tables also identify the impact of derivative contracts which we have elected to present on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis that are eligible for netting under master netting agreements.  

_______ 
           (a) 
    Level 1 consists primarily of New York Mercantile Exchange natural gas futures.  Level 2 consists primarily of OTC West Texas Intermediate swaps and options.  Level 3 consists primarily of power derivative contracts. 
              (b) 
    Cash margin deposits held by us associated with our energy commodity contract positions and OTC swap agreements and reported within  Other current liabilities  on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
              (c) 
    Cash margin deposits posted by us associated with our energy commodity contract positions and OTC swap agreements and reported within  Restricted deposits  on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
       
  The table below provides a summary of changes in the fair value of our Level 3 energy commodity derivative contracts (in millions):  

21 

As of December 31, 2015, our Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities consisted primarily of power derivative contracts (which expired in April 2016), where a significant portion of fair value is calculated from underlying market data that is not readily observable.  The derived values use industry standard methodologies that may consider the historical relationships among various commodities, modeled market prices, time value, volatility factors and other relevant economic measures.  The use of these inputs results in management s best estimate of fair value and management would not expect materially different valuation results were we to use different input amounts within reasonable ranges.   
    
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  The carrying value and estimated fair value of our outstanding debt balances are disclosed below (in millions):  

We used Level 2 input values to measure the estimated fair value of our outstanding debt balances as of both   September 30, 2016    and   December 31, 2015  . 

22 

7.  Reportable Segments 
   Financial information by segment follows (in millions): 

_______ 
  
   23 

(a) 
    We evaluate performance based on each segment s EBDA.  Segment EBDA includes revenues, earnings from equity investments, losses on impairments and divestitures of equity investments, net, allocable interest income, and other, net, less operating expenses, allocable income taxes, and other expense (income), net, and losses on impairments and divestitures, net. Operating expenses include natural gas purchases and other costs of sales, operations and maintenance expenses, and taxes, other than income taxes. 
              (b) 
    Includes cash and cash equivalents, margin and restricted deposits, unallocable interest receivable, prepaid assets and deferred charges, deferred tax assets, risk management assets related to debt fair value adjustments and miscellaneous corporate assets (such as information technology and telecommunications equipment) not allocated to individual segments.  

8.  Income Taxes 
    
  Income tax expense included in our accompanying consolidated statements of income were as follows (in millions, except percentages):  

The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   is higher than the statutory federal rate of   35%   primarily due to (i) the tax impact of the sale of a   50%   interest in SNG; (ii) state and foreign income taxes; and (iii) the change in the effective state tax rate as a result of the SNG sale. These increases are partially offset by dividend-received deductions from our investment in Florida Gas Pipeline (Citrus) and Plantation Pipe Line. The SNG partial sale transaction generated a taxable gain resulting from non-deductible goodwill attributable to the transaction which generated a deferred tax provision of   $269 million  . 
    
  The effective tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   is higher than the statutory federal rate of   35%   primarily due to state and foreign income taxes, partially offset by dividend-received deductions from our investment in Citrus and adjustments to our income tax reserve for uncertain tax positions. 
    
  The effective tax rate for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   is marginally higher than the statutory federal rate of   35%   primarily due to state and foreign income taxes, partially offset by (i) dividend-received deductions from our investment in Citrus; (ii) the change in the effective state tax rate as a result of the Hiland acquisition; and (iii) adjustments to our income tax reserve for uncertain tax positions. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions is   $146 million  , a decrease of   $27 million   from the December 31, 2015 balance of   $173 million  .  This   $27 million   decrease in unrecognized tax benefits resulted primarily from the settlement of a state tax audit and a certain statute of limitations expiration on another matter. 

9.  Litigation, Environmental and Other Contingencies  
    
  We and our subsidiaries are parties to various legal, regulatory and other matters arising from the day-to-day operations of our businesses or certain predecessor operations that may result in claims against the Company.  Although no assurance can be given, we believe, based on our experiences to date and taking into account established reserves and insurance, that the ultimate resolution of such items will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations or dividends to our shareholders.  We believe we have meritorious defenses to the matters to which we are a party and intend to vigorously defend the Company.  When we determine a loss is probable of occurring and is reasonably estimable, we accrue an undiscounted liability for such contingencies based on our best estimate using information available at that time.  If the estimated loss is a range of potential outcomes and there is no better estimate within the range, we accrue the amount at the low end of the range.  We disclose contingencies where an adverse outcome may be material, or in the judgment of management, we conclude the matter should otherwise be disclosed. 
    
  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Proceedings 
    
  SFPP 
    
  The tariffs and rates charged by SFPP are subject to a number of ongoing proceedings at the FERC, including the complaints and protests of various shippers the most recent of which was filed in late 2015 with the FERC (docketed at  
  
   24 

OR16-6) challenging SFPP s filed East Line rates.  In general, these complaints and protests allege the rates and tariffs charged by SFPP are not just and reasonable under the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA).  In some of these proceedings shippers have challenged the overall rate being charged by SFPP, and in others the shippers have challenged SFPP s index-based rate increases.  If the shippers prevail on their arguments or claims, they are entitled to seek reparations (which may reach back up to   two years   prior to the filing date of their complaints) or refunds of any excess rates paid, and SFPP may be required to reduce its rates going forward.  These proceedings tend to be protracted, with decisions of the FERC often appealed to the federal courts.  The issues involved in these proceedings include, among others, whether indexed rate increases are justified, and the appropriate level of return and income tax allowance SFPP may include in its rates.  On March 22, 2016, the D.C. Circuit issued a decision in   United Airlines, Inc. v. FERC   remanding to FERC for further consideration of two issues: (1) the appropriate data to be used to determine the return on equity for SFPP in the underlying docket, and (2) the just and reasonable return to be provided to a tax pass-through entity that includes an income tax allowance in its underlying cost of service.  With respect to the various SFPP related complaints and protest proceedings at the FERC, we estimate that the shippers are seeking approximately   $40 million   in annual rate reductions and approximately   $169 million   in refunds.  Management believes SFPP has meritorious arguments supporting SFPP s rates and intends to vigorously defend SFPP against these complaints and protests.  However, to the extent the shippers are successful in one or more of the complaints or protest proceedings, SFPP estimates that applying the principles of FERC precedent, as applicable, to pending SFPP cases would result in rate reductions and refunds substantially lower than those sought by the shippers. 
    
  EPNG 
    
  The tariffs and rates charged by EPNG are subject to   two   ongoing FERC proceedings (the  2008 rate case  and the  2010 rate case ).  With respect to the 2008 rate case, the FERC issued its decision (Opinion 517-A) in July 2015.  The FERC generally upheld its prior determinations, ordered refunds to be paid within 60 days, and stated that it will apply its findings in Opinion 517-A to the same issues in the 2010 rate case.  EPNG has sought federal appellate review of Opinion 517-A.  With respect to the 2010 rate case, the FERC issued its decision (Opinion 528-A) on February 18, 2016.  The FERC generally upheld its prior determinations, affirmed prior findings of an Administrative Law Judge that certain shippers qualify for lower rates, and required EPNG to file revised pro forma recalculated rates consistent with the terms of Opinions 517-A and 528-A.  EPNG and two intervenors sought rehearing of certain aspects of the decision, and the judicial review sought by certain intervenors has been delayed until the FERC issues an order on rehearing.  All refund obligations related to the 2008 rate case were satisfied during calendar year 2015.  With respect to the 2010 rate case, EPNG believes it has an appropriate reserve related to the findings in Opinions 517-A and 528-A. 
    
  Other Commercial Matters 
    
  Union Pacific Railroad Company Easements   Related Litigation 
    
  SFPP and Union Pacific Railroad Company (UPRR) are engaged in a proceeding to determine the extent, if any, to which the rent payable by SFPP for the use of pipeline easements on rights-of-way held by UPRR should be adjusted pursuant to existing contractual arrangements for the   ten  -year period beginning January 1, 2004 (  Union Pacific Railroad Company v. Santa Fe Pacific Pipelines, Inc., SFPP, L.P., Kinder Morgan Operating L.P.  D , Kinder Morgan G.P., Inc., et al.,   Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles, filed July 28, 2004). In September 2011, the trial judge determined that the annual rent payable as of January 1, 2004 was   $14 million  , subject to annual consumer price index increases.  SFPP appealed the judgment. 
    
  By notice dated October 25, 2013, UPRR demanded the payment of   $22.3 million   in rent for the first year of the next   ten  -year period beginning January 1, 2014, which SFPP rejected. 
    
  On November 5, 2014, the Court of Appeals issued an opinion which reversed the judgment, including the award of prejudgment interest, and remanded the matter to the trial court for a determination of UPRR s property interest in its right-of-way, including whether UPRR has sufficient interest to grant SFPP s easements.  UPRR filed a petition for review to the California Supreme Court which was denied.  The trial court has not set a date for the retrial. 
    
  After the above-referenced decision by the California Court of Appeals which held that UPRR does not own the subsurface rights to grant certain easements and may not be able to collect rent from those easements, a purported class action lawsuit was filed in 2015 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California by private landowners in California who claim to be the lawful owners of subsurface real property allegedly used or occupied by UPRR or SFPP. Substantially similar follow-on lawsuits were filed and are pending in federal courts by landowners in Nevada, Arizona and New Mexico. These suits, which are brought purportedly as class actions on behalf of all landowners who own land in fee adjacent to and underlying the railroad easement under which the SFPP pipeline is located in those respective states, assert claims against UPRR, SFPP, KMGP, and  
  
   25 

Kinder Morgan Operating L.P.  D  for declaratory judgment, trespass, ejectment, quiet title, unjust enrichment, accounting, and alleged unlawful business acts and practices arising from defendants  alleged improper use or occupation of subsurface real property.  SFPP views these cases as primarily a dispute between UPRR and the plaintiffs.  UPRR purported to grant SFPP a network of subsurface pipeline easements along UPRR s railroad right-of-way.  SFPP relied on the validity of those easements and paid rent to UPRR for the value of those easements.  We believe we have recorded a right-of-way liability sufficient to cover our potential obligation, if any, for back rent. 
    
  SFPP and UPRR have engaged in multiple disputes over the circumstances under which SFPP must pay for relocations of its pipeline within the UPRR right-of-way and the safety standards that govern relocations.  In 2006, following a bench trial regarding the circumstances under which SFPP must pay for relocations, the judge determined that SFPP must pay for any relocations resulting from any legitimate business purpose of the UPRR.  The decision was affirmed on appeal.  In addition, UPRR contends that SFPP must comply with the more expensive American Railway Engineering and Maintenance-of-Way Association (AREMA) standards in determining when relocations are necessary and in completing relocations.  Each party has sought declaratory relief with respect to its positions regarding the application of these standards with respect to relocations.  In 2011, a jury verdict was reached that SFPP was obligated to comply with AREMA standards in connection with a railroad project in Beaumont Hills, California.  In 2014, the trial court entered judgment against SFPP, consistent with the jury s verdict.  On June 29, 2015, the parties entered into a confidential settlement of all of the claims relating to the project in Beaumont Hills and the case was dismissed. 
    
  Since SFPP does not know UPRR s plans for projects or other activities that would cause pipeline relocations, it is difficult to quantify the effects of the outcome of these cases on SFPP.  Even if SFPP is successful in advancing its positions, significant relocations for which SFPP must nonetheless bear the cost (i.e., for railroad purposes, with the standards in the federal Pipeline Safety Act applying) could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and our  dividends to our shareholders.  These effects could be even greater in the event SFPP is unsuccessful in one or more of these lawsuits.  
    
  Gulf LNG Facility Arbitration  
    
  On March 1, 2016, Gulf LNG Energy, LLC and Gulf LNG Pipeline, LLC (GLNG) received a Notice of Disagreement and Disputed Statements and a Notice of Arbitration from Eni USA Gas Marketing LLC (Eni USA), one of two companies that entered into a terminal use agreement for capacity of the Gulf LNG Facility in Mississippi for an initial term that is not scheduled to expire until the year 2031.  Eni USA is an indirect subsidiary of Eni S.p.A., a multi-national integrated energy company headquartered in Milan, Italy.  Pursuant to its Notice of Arbitration, Eni USA seeks declaratory and monetary relief based upon its assertion that (i) the terminal use agreement should be terminated because changes in the U.S. natural gas market since the execution of the agreement in December 2007 have  frustrated the essential purpose  of the agreement and (ii) activities allegedly undertaken by affiliates of Gulf LNG Holdings Group LLC  in connection with a plan to convert the LNG Facility into a liquefaction/export facility have given rise to a contractual right on the part of Eni USA to terminate  the agreement.  As set forth in the terminal use agreement, disputes are meant to be resolved by final and binding arbitration.  A three-member arbitration panel has been selected and the arbitration hearing is scheduled for January 2017.  Eni USA has indicated that it will continue to pay the amounts claimed to be due pending resolution of the dispute.  The successful assertion by Eni USA of its claim to terminate or amend its payment obligations under the agreement prior to the expiration of its initial term could have an adverse effect on the business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows of GLNG and distributions to KMI, a   50%   shareholder of GLNG.  We view the allegations in the demand for arbitration to be without merit, and we intend to vigorously contest them in the arbitration. 
    
  Plains Gas Solutions, LLC v. Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, L.L.C. et al. 
    
  On October 16, 2013, Plains Gas Solutions, LLC (Plains) filed a petition in the 151   st    Judicial District Court for Harris County, Texas (Case No. 62528) against TGP, Kinetica Partners, LLC and two other Kinetica entities.  The suit arises from the sale by TGP of the Cameron System in Louisiana to Kinetica Partners, LLC on September 1, 2013.  Plains alleges that defendants breached a straddle agreement requiring that gas on the Cameron System be committed to Plains  Grand Chenier gas-processing facility, that requisite daily volume reports were not provided, that TGP improperly assigned its obligations under the straddle agreement to Kinetica, and that defendants interfered with Plains  contracts with producers.  The petition alleges damages of at least   $100 million  .  Under the Amended and Restated Purchase and Sale Agreement with Kinetica, Kinetica is obligated to defend and indemnify TGP in connection with the gas commitment and reporting claims.  After agreeing initially to defend and indemnify TGP against such claims, Kinetica withdrew its defense, disputed its indemnity obligation, and settled with Plains.  Trial of the remaining claims against TGP is scheduled for January 2017.  We intend to vigorously defend the suit and pursue Kinetica, if necessary, for indemnity and costs of defense.

Brinckerhoff v. El Paso Pipeline GP Company, LLC., et al.  
    
  In December 2011 (  Brinckerhoff I  ), March 2012, (  Brinckerhoff II  ), May 2013 (  Brinckerhoff III  ) and June 2014 (  Brinckerhoff IV),   derivative lawsuits were filed in Delaware Chancery Court against El Paso Corporation, El Paso Pipeline GP Company, L.L.C., the general partner of EPB, and the directors of the general partner at the time of the relevant transactions.  EPB was named in these lawsuits as a  Nominal Defendant.  The lawsuits arise from the March 2010, November 2010, May 2012 and June 2011 drop-down transactions involving EPB s purchase of SLNG, Elba Express, CPG and interests in SNG and CIG.  The lawsuits allege various conflicts of interest and that the consideration paid by EPB was excessive.  Brinckerhoff I and II were consolidated into one proceeding. Motions to dismiss were filed in Brinckerhoff III and Brinckerhoff IV, and such motions remain pending.  On June 12, 2014, defendants  motion for summary judgment was granted in Brinckerhoff I, dismissing the case in its entirety. Defendants  motion for summary judgment in Brinckerhoff II was granted in part, dismissing certain claims and allowing the matter to go to trial in late 2014 on the remaining claims. On April 20, 2015, the Court issued a post-trial memorandum opinion (Memorandum Opinion) in Brinckerhoff II entering judgment in favor of all of the defendants other than the general partner of EPB, but finding the general partner liable for breach of contract in connection with EPB s purchase of   49%   interests in Elba and SLNG and a   15%   interest in SNG in a   $1.13 billion   drop-down transaction that closed on November 19, 2010 (Fall Dropdown), prior to our acquisition of El Paso Corporation in 2012.  In its Memorandum Opinion, the Court determined that EPB suffered damages of   $171 million   from the Fall Dropdown, which the Court determined to be the amount that EPB overpaid for Elba.  We believe the claim is derivative in nature and was extinguished by our acquisition on November 26, 2014, pursuant to a merger agreement, of all of the outstanding common units of EPB that we did not already own.  On December 2, 2015, the Court denied our motion to dismiss the remaining claims in Brinckerhoff II based upon our acquisition of all of the outstanding common units of EPB, and held that damages should be calculated by considering the unaffiliated unitholders  ownership percentage as of the effective date of the merger.  Based on this ruling, the Court entered judgment on February 4, 2016 in the amount of   $100.2 million   plus interest at the legal rate for the period from November 15, 2010 until the date of payment, if any payment is ultimately required.  We filed an appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court and Brinckerhoff filed a cross-appeal challenging the dismissal of Brinckerhoff I.  The appeal has been fully briefed and oral argument was held on October 19, 2016.  Execution on the judgment has been stayed until the appeal is decided.  At the present time, we do not believe that an ultimate award, if any, will have a material financial impact on our Company.  We continue to believe the transactions at issue were appropriate and in the best interests of EPB and we intend to continue to defend the lawsuits vigorously. 
    
  Price Reporting Litigation  
    
  Beginning in 2003, several lawsuits were filed by purchasers of natural gas against El Paso Corporation, El Paso Marketing L.P. and numerous other energy companies based on a claim under state antitrust law that such defendants conspired to manipulate the price of natural gas by providing false price information to industry trade publications that published gas indices.  Several of the cases have been settled or dismissed.  The remaining cases, which were pending in Nevada federal court, were dismissed, but the dismissal was reversed by the 9   th    Circuit Court of Appeals.  The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the 9   th    Circuit Court of Appeals in a decision dated April 21, 2015, and the cases were then remanded to the Nevada federal court for further consideration and trial, if necessary, of numerous remaining issues.  On May 24, 2016, the Court granted a motion for summary judgment dismissing one of the cases in which approximately   $500 million   in damages has been alleged.  In the remaining cases, approximately   $1.5 billion   in damages have been alleged against all defendants.  There remains significant uncertainty regarding the validity of the causes of action, the damages asserted and the level of damages, if any, which may be allocated to us.  Therefore, our costs and legal exposure related to the remaining outstanding lawsuits and claims are not currently determinable.  
    
  Kinder Morgan, Inc. Corporate Reorganization Litigation 
    
  Certain unitholders of KMP and EPB filed   five   putative class action lawsuits in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in connection with our November 26, 2014 acquisition, pursuant to three separate merger agreements, of all of the outstanding common units of KMP and EPB and all of the outstanding shares of KMR that we did not already own.  The lawsuits were consolidated under the caption   In re Kinder Morgan, Inc. Corporate Reorganization Litigation   (Consolidated Case No. 10093-VCL).  On December 12, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a Verified Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint, which purported to assert claims on behalf of both the former EPB unitholders and the former KMP unitholders.  The EPB plaintiff alleged that (i) El Paso Pipeline GP Company, L.L.C. (  EPGP  ), the general partner of EPB, and the directors of EPGP breached duties under the EPB partnership agreement, including the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, by entering into the EPB Transaction; (ii) EPB, E Merger Sub LLC, KMI and individual defendants aided and abetted such breaches; and (iii) EPB, E Merger Sub LLC, KMI, and individual defendants tortiously interfered with the EPB partnership agreement by causing EPGP to breach its duties under the EPB partnership agreement.  

27 

The KMP plaintiffs alleged that (i) KMR, KMGP, and individual defendants breached duties under the KMP partnership agreement, including the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, by entering into the KMP Transaction and by failing to adequately disclose material facts related to the transaction; (ii) KMI aided and abetted such breach; and (iii) KMI, KMP, KMR, P Merger Sub LLC, and individual defendants tortiously interfered with the rights of the plaintiffs and the putative class under the KMP partnership agreement by causing KMGP to breach its duties under the KMP partnership agreement. The complaint sought declaratory relief that the transactions were unlawful and unenforceable, reformation, rescission, rescissory or compensatory damages, interest, and attorneys  and experts  fees and costs.  On December 30, 2014, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint.  On April 2, 2015, the EPB plaintiff and the defendants submitted a stipulation and proposed order of dismissal, agreeing to dismiss all claims brought by the EPB plaintiff with prejudice as to the EPB lead plaintiff and without prejudice to all other members of the putative EPB class.  The Court entered such order on April 2, 2015.   
    
  On August 24, 2015, the Court issued an order granting the defendants  motion to dismiss the remaining counts of the complaint for failure to state a claim.  On September 21, 2015, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware, captioned   Haynes Family Trust et al. v. Kinder Morgan G.P., Inc. et al.   (Case No. 515).  On March 10, 2016, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of all claims on appeal and this matter is now concluded. 
    
  Pipeline Integrity and Releases 
    
  From time to time, despite our best efforts, our pipelines experience leaks and ruptures.  These leaks and ruptures may cause explosions, fire, and damage to the environment, damage to property and/or personal injury or death.  In connection with these incidents, we may be sued for damages caused by an alleged failure to properly mark the locations of our pipelines and/or to properly maintain our pipelines.  Depending upon the facts and circumstances of a particular incident, state and federal regulatory authorities may seek civil and/or criminal fines and penalties. 
    
  General 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, our total reserve for legal matters was   $502 million   and   $463 million  , respectively.  The reserve primarily relates to various claims from regulatory proceedings arising in our products and natural gas pipeline segments and certain corporate matters.  
    
  Environmental Matters 
    
  We and our subsidiaries are subject to environmental cleanup and enforcement actions from time to time.  In particular, CERCLA generally imposes joint and several liability for cleanup and enforcement costs on current and predecessor owners and operators of a site, among others, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, subject to the right of a liable party to establish a  reasonable basis  for apportionment of costs.  Our operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment.  Although we believe our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, risks of additional costs and liabilities are inherent in pipeline, terminal and CO   2    field and oil field operations, and there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities.  Moreover, it is possible that other developments, such as increasingly stringent environmental laws, regulations and enforcement policies under the terms of authority of those laws, and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from our operations, could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us. 
    
  We are currently involved in several governmental proceedings involving alleged violations of environmental and safety regulations, including alleged violations of the Risk Management Program and leak detection and repair requirements of the Clean Air Act.  As we receive notices of non-compliance, we attempt to negotiate and settle such matters where appropriate.  These alleged violations may result in fines and penalties, but we do not believe any such fines and penalties, individually or in the aggregate, will be material.  We are also currently involved in several governmental proceedings involving groundwater and soil remediation efforts under administrative orders or related state remediation programs.  We have established a reserve to address the costs associated with the cleanup. 
    
  In addition, we are involved with and have been identified as a potentially responsible party in several federal and state superfund sites.  Environmental reserves have been established for those sites where our contribution is probable and reasonably estimable.  In addition, we are from time to time involved in civil proceedings relating to damages alleged to have occurred as a result of accidental leaks or spills of refined petroleum products, NGL, natural gas and CO   2   .

Portland Harbor Superfund Site, Willamette River, Portland, Oregon 
    
  In December 2000, the EPA issued General Notice letters to potentially responsible parties including GATX Terminals Corporation (n/k/a KMLT).  At that time, GATX owned   two   liquids terminals along the lower reach of the Willamette River, an industrialized area known as Portland Harbor.  Portland Harbor is listed on the National Priorities List and is designated as a Superfund Site under CERCLA.  A group of potentially responsible parties formed what is known as the Lower Willamette Group (LWG), of which KMLT is a non-voting member and pays a minimal fee to be part of the group.  The LWG agreed to conduct the remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) leading to the proposed remedy for cleanup of the Portland Harbor site.  After a dispute with the EPA concerning certain provision of the FS, the parties agreed that the EPA would complete the FS and that the LWG may dispute the FS within 14 days of the publication of the proposed remedy for cleanup.  EPA issued the FS and the Proposed Plan on June 8, 2016.  The EPA s Proposed Plan includes a combination of dredging, capping, and enhanced natural recovery.  It is expected to take approximately   seven   years to implement at an estimated present cost of approximately   $750 million  .  Comments on the FS and the Proposed Plan were submitted by the LWG and on our own behalf on September 7, 2016.  We anticipate the EPA will issue a Record of Decision (ROD) in mid-2017.  KMLT and   90   other parties are involved in a non-judicial allocation process to determine each party s respective share of the cleanup costs.  We are participating in the allocation process on behalf of KMLT and KMBT in connection with their current or former ownership or operation of   four   facilities located in Portland Harbor.  The allocation process will follow the issuance of the ROD with an expected completion date of 2018.  Until the allocation process is completed, we are unable to reasonably estimate the extent of our liability for the costs related to the design of the proposed remedy and cleanup of the site. 
    
  Roosevelt Irrigation District v. Kinder Morgan G.P., Inc., Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. , U.S. District Court, Arizona 
    
  The Roosevelt Irrigation District sued KMGP, KMEP and others under CERCLA for alleged contamination of the water purveyor s wells. The First Amended Complaint sought   $175 million   in damages from approximately   70   defendants.  On August 6, 2013 plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint seeking monetary damages in unspecified amounts and reducing the number of defendants to   26   including KMEP and SFPP.  The claims now presented against KMEP and SFPP are related to alleged releases from a specific parcel within the SFPP Phoenix Terminal and the alleged impact of such releases on water wells owned by the plaintiffs and located in the vicinity of the Terminal.  We have filed an answer, general denial, and affirmative defenses in response to the Second Amended Complaint and fact discovery is proceeding. 
    
  Mission Valley Terminal Lawsuit 
    
  In August 2007, the City of San Diego, on its own behalf and purporting to act on behalf of the People of the State of California, filed a lawsuit against us and several affiliates seeking injunctive relief and unspecified damages allegedly resulting from hydrocarbon and methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) impacted soils and groundwater beneath the City s stadium property in San Diego arising from historic operations at the Mission Valley terminal facility.  The case was filed in the Superior Court of California, San Diego County and was removed in 2007 to the U.S. District Court, Southern District of California (Case No. 07CV1883WCAB).  The City disclosed in discovery that it was seeking approximately   $170 million   in damages for alleged lost value/lost profit from the redevelopment of the City s property and alleged lost use of the water resources underlying the property.  Later, in 2010, the City amended its initial disclosures to add claims for restoration of the site as well as a number of other claims that increased its claim for damages to approximately   $365 million  . 
    
  On November 29, 2012, the Court issued a Notice of Tentative Rulings on the parties  summary adjudication motions.  The Court tentatively granted our partial motions for summary judgment on the City s claims for water and real estate damages and the State s claims for violations of California Business and Professions Code   17200, tentatively denied the City s motion for summary judgment on its claims of liability for nuisance and trespass, and tentatively granted our cross motion for summary judgment on such claims.  On January 25, 2013, the Court rendered judgment in favor of all defendants on all claims asserted by the City. 
    
  On February 20, 2013, the City of San Diego filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  On May 21, 2015, the Court of Appeals issued a memorandum decision which affirmed the District Court s summary judgment in our favor with respect to the City s claim under California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act, but reversed both the District Court s summary judgment decision in our favor on the City s remaining claims and the District Court s decision to exclude the City s expert testimony.  The Court of Appeals issued a mandate returning the case to the U.S. District Court. 
    
  On June 17, 2016, the parties entered into a settlement resolving all claims related to the historical contamination at the City s stadium property.  The settlement provides for a   $20 million   payment to the City, a waiver and release by the City of all  
  
   29 

claims which were asserted or could have been asserted in the litigation, and an agreement by defendants to indemnify the City for additional, incremental costs, if any, incurred by the City in the redevelopment of the stadium property or the development of groundwater beneath the stadium property, that would not have been incurred but for the historical releases from the Mission Valley Terminal.  By Order dated June 17, 2016, the District Court granted dismissal of the litigation. 
    
  This site remains under the regulatory oversight and order of the California Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB).  SFPP completed the soil and groundwater remediation at the City of San Diego s stadium property site and conducted quarterly sampling and monitoring through 2015 as part of the compliance evaluation required by the RWQCB.  The RWQCB issued a notice of no further action with respect to the stadium property site on May 4, 2016.  SFPP s remediation effort is now focused on its adjacent Mission Valley Terminal site. 
    
  Uranium Mines in Vicinity of Cameron, Arizona 
    
  In the 1950s and 1960s, Rare Metals Inc., a historical subsidiary of EPNG, mined approximately   twenty   uranium mines in the vicinity of Cameron, Arizona, many of which are located on the Navajo Indian Reservation.  The mining activities were in response to numerous incentives provided to industry by the U.S. to locate and produce domestic sources of uranium to support the Cold War-era nuclear weapons program.  In May 2012, EPNG received a general notice letter from the EPA notifying EPNG of the EPA s investigation of certain sites and its determination that the EPA considers EPNG to be a potentially responsible party within the meaning of CERCLA.  In August 2013, EPNG and the EPA entered into an Administrative Order on Consent and Scope of Work pursuant to which EPNG is conducting a radiological assessment of the surface of the mines.  On September 3, 2014, EPNG filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona (Case No. 3:14-08165-DGC) seeking cost recovery and contribution from the applicable federal government agencies toward the cost of environmental activities associated with the mines, given the pervasive control of such federal agencies over all aspects of the nuclear weapons program.  Defendants filed an answer and counterclaims seeking contribution and recovery of response costs allegedly incurred by the federal agencies in investigating uranium impacts on the Navajo Reservation.  The counterclaim of defendant EPA has been settled, and no viable claims for reimbursement by the other defendants are known to exist. 
    
  Lower Passaic River Study Area of the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site, Essex, Hudson, Bergen and Passaic Counties, New Jersey 
    
  EPEC Polymers, Inc. (EPEC Polymers) and EPEC Oil Company Liquidating Trust (EPEC Oil Trust), former El Paso Corporation entities now owned by KMI, are involved in an administrative action under CERCLA known as the Lower Passaic River Study Area Superfund Site (Site) concerning the lower 17-mile stretch of the Passaic River. It has been alleged that EPEC Polymers and EPEC Oil Trust may be potentially responsible parties (PRPs) under CERCLA based on prior ownership and/or operation of properties located along the relevant section of the Passaic River. EPEC Polymers and EPEC Oil Trust entered into two Administrative Orders on Consent (AOCs) which obligate them to investigate and characterize contamination at the Site. They are also part of a joint defense group (JDG) of approximately   70   cooperating parties which have entered into AOCs and are directing and funding the work required by the EPA.  Under the first AOC, draft remedial investigation and feasibility studies (RI/FS) of the Site were submitted to the EPA in 2015, and comments from the EPA are expected by the end of 2016.  Under the second AOC, the JDG members conducted a CERCLA removal action at the Passaic River Mile 10.9, and the group is currently conducting EPA-directed post-remedy monitoring in the removal area.  We have established a reserve for the anticipated cost of compliance with the AOCs. 
    
  On April 11, 2014, the EPA announced the issuance of its Focused Feasibility Study (FFS) for the lower eight miles of the Passaic River Study Area, and its proposed plan for remedial alternatives to address the dioxin sediment contamination from the mouth of Newark Bay to River Mile 8.3.  The EPA estimates the cost for the alternatives will range from   $365 million   to   $3.2 billion  . The EPA s preferred alternative would involve dredging the river bank-to-bank and installing an engineered cap at an estimated cost of   $1.7 billion  .  On March 4, 2016, the EPA issued its ROD for the lower 8.3 miles of the Passaic River Study area.  The final cleanup plan in the ROD is substantially similar to the EPA s preferred alternative announced on April 11, 2014.  On October 5, 2016, the EPA entered into an AOC with one member of the PRP group requiring such member to spend   $165 million   to perform engineering and design work necessary to begin the cleanup of the lower 8.3 miles of the Passaic River.  The design work is expected to take   four   years to complete and the cleanup is expected to take   six   years to complete. 
    
  In addition to the AOC with one member of the PRP group described above, the EPA has notified over 80 other PRPs, including EPEC Polymers and EPEC Oil Trust (the Notice), that the EPA intends to pursue additional agreements with other  major PRPs  and initiate negotiations over cash buyouts with parties whom the EPA does not consider  major PRPs.   The Notice creates significant uncertainty as to the implementation and associated costs of the remedy set forth in the FFS and ROD, and provides no guidance as to the EPA s definition of a  major PRP  or the potential amount or range of cash buyouts.  There is also uncertainty as to the impact of the RI/FS that the CPG is currently preparing for portions of the Site.  The draft RI/ 
  
   30 

FS was submitted by the CPG earlier in 2015 and proposes a different remedy than the FFS announced by the EPA.  Therefore, the scope of potential EPA claims for the lower eight miles of the Passaic River is not reasonably estimable at this time. 
    
  Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Litigation  
    
  On July 24, 2013, the Board of Commissioners of the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority - East (SLFPA) filed a petition for damages and injunctive relief in state district court for Orleans Parish, Louisiana (Case No. 13-6911) against TGP, SNG and approximately   100   other energy companies, alleging that defendants  drilling, dredging, pipeline and industrial operations since the 1930 s have caused direct land loss and increased erosion and submergence resulting in alleged increased storm surge risk, increased flood protection costs and unspecified damages to the plaintiff.  The SLFPA asserts claims for negligence, strict liability, public nuisance, private nuisance, and breach of contract.  Among other relief, the petition seeks unspecified monetary damages, attorney fees, interest, and injunctive relief in the form of abatement and restoration of the alleged coastal land loss including but not limited to backfilling and re-vegetation of canals, wetlands and reef creation, land bridge construction, hydrologic restoration, shoreline protection, structural protection, and bank stabilization.  On August 13, 2013, the suit was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.  On February 13, 2015, the Court granted defendants  motion to dismiss the suit for failure to state a claim, and issued an order dismissing the SLFPA s claims with prejudice.  The SLFPA filed a notice of appeal on February 20, 2015.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit heard oral argument on February 29, 2016 and we await the Court s decision. 
    
  Plaquemines Parish Louisiana Coastal Zone Litigation 
    
  On November 8, 2013, the Parish of Plaquemines, Louisiana filed a petition for damages in the state district court for Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana (Docket No. 60-999) against TGP and   17   other energy companies, alleging that defendants  oil and gas exploration, production and transportation operations in the Bastian Bay, Buras, Empire and Fort Jackson oil and gas fields of Plaquemines Parish caused substantial damage to the coastal waters and nearby lands (Coastal Zone) within the Parish, including the erosion of marshes and the discharge of oil waste and other pollutants which detrimentally affected the quality of state waters and plant and animal life, in violation of the State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act of 1978 (Coastal Zone Management Act).  As a result of such alleged violations of the Coastal Zone Management Act, Plaquemines Parish seeks, among other relief, unspecified monetary relief, attorney fees, interest, and payment of costs necessary to restore the allegedly affected Coastal Zone to its original condition, including costs to clear, vegetate and detoxify the Coastal Zone.  In connection with this suit, TGP has made two tenders for defense and indemnity: (1) to Anadarko, as successor to the entity that purchased TGP s oil and gas assets in Bastian Bay, and (2) to Kinetica, which purchased TGP s pipeline assets in Bastian Bay in 2013.  Anadarko has accepted TGP s tender (limited to oil and gas assets), and Kinetica rejected TGP s tender.  TGP responded to Kinetica by reasserting TGP s demand for defense and indemnity and reserving its rights.  On November 12, 2015, the Plaquemines Parish Council adopted a resolution directing its legal counsel in all its Coastal Zone cases to take all actions necessary to cause the dismissal of all such cases.  On April 14, 2016, following interventions in the suit by the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources and Attorney General, the Parish Council passed a resolution rescinding its November 12, 2015 resolution that had directed its counsel to dismiss the suit.  We intend to continue to vigorously defend the suit. 
    
  Vermilion Parish Louisiana Coastal Zone Litigation 
  On July 28, 2016, the District Attorney for the 15   th    Judicial District of Louisiana, purporting to act on behalf of Vermilion Parish and the State of Louisiana, filed suit in the state district court for Vermilion Parish, Louisiana against TGP and   52   other energy companies, alleging that the defendants  oil and gas and transportation operations associated with the development of several fields in Vermilion Parish (Operational Areas) were conducted in violation of the Coastal Zone Management Act.  The suit alleges such operations caused substantial damage to the coastal waters and nearby lands (Coastal Zone) of Vermilion Parish, resulting in the release of pollutants and contaminants into the environment, improper discharge of oil field wastes, the improper use of waste pits and failure to close such pits, and the dredging of canals, which resulted in degradation of the Operational Areas, including erosion of marshes and degradation of terrestrial and aquatic life therein.  As a result of such alleged violations of the Coastal Zone Management Act, the suit seeks a judgment against the defendants awarding all appropriate damages, the payment of costs to clear, revegetate, detoxify and otherwise restore the Vermilion Parish Coastal  Zone,  actual restoration of the affected Coastal Zone to its original condition, and reasonable costs and attorney fees.  On September 2, 2016, the case was removed to the United Stated District Court for the Western District of Louisiana. On September 20, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a motion to remand the case back to the state district court.  A hearing on this motion has been continued until a decision has been reached by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in the   Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Litigation   discussed above.

General 
    
  Although it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcomes, we believe that the resolution of the environmental matters set forth in this note, and other matters to which we and our subsidiaries are a party, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  As of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , we have accrued a total reserve for environmental liabilities in the amount of   $312 million   and   $284 million  , respectively.  In addition, as of both   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , we have recorded a receivable of   $13 million  , for expected cost recoveries that have been deemed probable. 
    
  Other Contingencies 
    
  SNG s   $1,211 million   of public debt continues to be subject to our guarantee pursuant to the cross guarantee agreement.  As a result of our sale of a   50%   equity interest in SNG, and given that we expect the Investment Grade Rating requirement imposed by Section 6(c) of the cross guarantee agreement to be satisfied, our guarantee will be released on December 2, 2016.

11.  Guarantee of Securities of Subsidiaries  
    
  KMI, along with its direct subsidiary KMP, are issuers of certain public debt securities.  KMI, KMP and substantially all of KMI s wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, are parties to a cross guarantee agreement whereby each party to the agreement unconditionally guarantees, jointly and severally, the payment of specified indebtedness of each other party to the agreement.  Accordingly, with the exception of certain subsidiaries identified as Subsidiary Non-Guarantors, the parent issuer, subsidiary issuer and other subsidiaries are all guarantors of each series of public debt.  As a result of the cross guarantee agreement, a holder of any of the guaranteed public debt securities issued by KMI or KMP are in the same position with respect to the net assets, income and cash flows of KMI and the Subsidiary Issuer and Guarantors.  The only amounts that are not available to the holders of each of the guaranteed public debt securities to satisfy the repayment of such securities are the net assets, income and cash flows of the Subsidiary Non-Guarantors.   
    
  In lieu of providing separate financial statements for subsidiary issuer and guarantor, we have included the accompanying condensed consolidating financial statements based on Rule 3-10 of the SEC s Regulation S-X.  We have presented each of the parent and subsidiary issuer in separate columns in this single set of condensed consolidating financial statements. 
    
  On September 30, 2016, Copano (previously reflected as a Subsidiary Issuer and Guarantor) repaid the   $332 million   principal amount of its   7.125%   senior notes due 2021. Copano continues to be a subsidiary guarantor under the cross guarantee agreement mentioned above.  For all periods presented, financial statement balances and activities for Copano are now reflected within the Subsidiary Guarantor column, and the Subsidiary Issuer and Guarantor-Copano column has been eliminated. 
    
  On September 1, 2016, we sold a   50%   equity interest in SNG (see further details discussed in Note 2,  Acquisitions and Divestiture ).  Subsequent to the transaction, we deconsolidated SNG and now account for our equity interest in SNG as an equity investment.  Our wholly owned subsidiary which holds our interest in SNG is reflected within the Subsidiary Guarantors column of these condensed consolidating financial statements. 
    
  Excluding fair value adjustments, as of   September 30, 2016  , Parent Issuer and Guarantor, Subsidiary Issuer and Guarantor-KMP, and Subsidiary Guarantors had   $14,325 million  ,   $19,485 million  , and   $4,947 million  , respectively, of Guaranteed Notes outstanding.  Included in the Subsidiary Guarantors debt balance as presented in the accompanying   September 30, 2016   condensed consolidating balance sheets is approximately   $171 million   of capital lease obligation that is not subject to the cross guarantee agreement. 
    
  The accounts within the Parent Issuer and Guarantor, Subsidiary Issuer and Guarantor-KMP, Subsidiary Guarantors and Subsidiary Non-Guarantors are presented using the equity method of accounting for investments in subsidiaries, including subsidiaries that are guarantors and non-guarantors, for purposes of these condensed consolidating financial statements only.   
  
   33 

These intercompany investments and related activity eliminate in consolidation and are presented separately in the accompanying balance sheets and statements of income and cash flows. 
    
  A significant amount of each Issuers  income and cash flow is generated by its respective subsidiaries.  As a result, the funds necessary to meet its debt service and/or guarantee obligations are provided in large part by distributions or advances it receives from its respective subsidiaries.  We utilize a centralized cash pooling program among our majority-owned and consolidated subsidiaries, including the Subsidiary Issuers and Guarantors and Subsidiary Non-Guarantors. The following Condensed Consolidating Statements of Cash Flows present the intercompany loan and distribution activity, as well as cash collection and payments made on behalf of our subsidiaries, as cash activities. 
    
  Effective December 31, 2015, Kinder Morgan (Delaware), Inc. and Kinder Morgan Services LLC merged into KMI. As a result of such merger, both entities are no longer Subsidiary Guarantors, and for all periods presented, financial statement balances and activities for Kinder Morgan (Delaware), Inc. and Kinder Morgan Services LLC are reflected within the Parent Issuer and Guarantor column.

Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
   
  General and Basis of Presentation 
  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our accompanying interim consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report, and in conjunction with (i) our consolidated financial statements and related notes and (ii) our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in our   2015   Form 10-K. 

Results of Operations 
  Overview 
    
  Our management evaluates our performance primarily using the measures of Segment EBDA and, as discussed below under   Non-GAAP Measures,  distributable cash flow, or DCF, and Segment EBDA before certain items.  Segment EBDA is a useful measure of our operating performance because it measures the operating results of our segments before DD A and certain expenses that are generally not controllable by our business segment operating managers, such as interest expense, general and administrative expenses, and unallocable interest income and income taxes, as well as net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.  Our general and administrative expenses include such items as employee benefits, insurance, rentals, unallocated litigation and environmental expenses, and shared corporate services including accounting, information technology, human resources and legal services.    
    
  Consolidated Earnings Results 

43 

_______ 
  n/a   not applicable 
    
           (a) 
    Includes revenues, earnings from equity investments, allocable interest income and other, net, less operating expenses, allocable income taxes, other expense (income), net, losses on impairments and divestitures, net and losses on impairments and divestitures of equity investments, net.  Operating expenses include natural gas purchases and other costs of sales, operations and maintenance expenses, and taxes, other than income taxes.  Allocable income tax expenses included in Segment EBDA for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $  14 million   and $18 million, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $  46 million   and $51 million, respectively. 
     Certain items affecting Total Segment EBDA (see   Non-GAAP Measures  below  ) 
           (b) 
    Three and nine month 2016 amounts include net decreases in earnings of   $425 million   and   $730 million  , respectively, and three and nine month 2015 amounts include net decreases in earnings of $247 million and $363 million, respectively, related to the combined effect of the certain items impacting Total Segment EBDA.  The extent to which these items affect each of our business segments is discussed below in the footnotes to the tables within   Segment Earnings Results.    
              (c) 
    Three and nine month 2016 amounts include net increases in expense of   $4 million   and   $32 million  , respectively, and three and nine month 2015 amounts include a decrease in expense of $2 million and an increase in expense of $27 million, respectively, related to the combined effect of the certain items related to general and administrative expense disclosed below in   General and Administrative, Interest, and Noncontrolling Interests.  
              (d) 
    Three and nine month 2016 amounts include net decreases in expense of   $31 million   and   $140 million  , respectively, and three and nine month 2015 amounts include an increase in expense of $15 million and a decrease in expense of $40 million, respectively, related to the combined effect of the certain items related to interest expense, net of unallocable interest income disclosed below in   General and Administrative, Interest, and Noncontrolling Interests.  
       
  The certain item totals reflected in footnotes (b), (c) and (d) to the tables above accounted for   $138 million   of the decrease in income before unallocable income taxes for the third quarter of 2016, as compared to the same prior year period (representing the difference between decreases of   $398 million   and $260 million in income before unallocable income taxes for the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively) and a decrease of   $272 million   in income before unallocable income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the same prior year period (representing the difference between decreases of   $622 million   and $350 million in income before unallocable income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively). After giving effect to these certain items, the remaining increases in income before unallocable income taxes from the prior year quarter and year-to-date were   $45 million   (  8%  ) and   $62 million   (  4%  ), respectively.  The quarter-to-date increase from 2015 reflects decreased DD A expense and interest expense, net of allocable interest income and increased results in our Terminals and Products Pipelines business segments, mostly offset by unfavorable commodity prices affecting our CO  2   business segment and unfavorable results in our Natural Gas Pipelines business segment.  The year-to-date increase from 2015 reflects increased results in our Products Pipelines, Terminals, and Natural Gas Pipelines business segments and decreased DD A expense and interest expense, net of allocable interest income, mostly offset by  
  
   44 

unfavorable commodity prices affecting our CO  2   business segment.  The quarter-to-date and year-to-date decreases in DD A were primarily driven by lower DD A in our CO  2   business segment.  The quarter-to-date and year-to-date decreases in interest expense were due to lower weighted average debt balances, partially offset by a slightly higher overall weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt, respectively. 
    
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  Our non-GAAP performance measures are DCF, both in the aggregate and per share, and Segment EBDA before certain items. Certain items are items that are required by GAAP to be reflected in net income, but typically either (i) do not have a cash impact (for example, asset impairments), or (ii) by their nature are separately identifiable from our normal business operations and in our view are likely to occur only sporadically (for example certain legal settlements, hurricane impacts and casualty losses). 
    
  Our non-GAAP performance measures described below should not be considered alternatives to GAAP net income or other GAAP measures and have important limitations as analytical tools.  Our computations of DCF and Segment EBDA before certain items may differ from similarly titled measures used by others.  You should not consider these non-GAAP performance measures in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.  DCF should not be used as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities computed under GAAP.  Management compensates for the limitations of these non-GAAP performance measures by reviewing our comparable GAAP measures, understanding the differences between the measures and taking this information into account in its analysis and its decision making processes. 
    
  Distributable Cash Flow 
    
  DCF is a significant performance measure used by us and by external users of our financial statements to evaluate our performance and to measure and estimate the ability of our assets to generate cash earnings after servicing our debt and preferred stock dividends, paying cash taxes and expending sustaining capital, that could be used for discretionary purposes such as common stock dividends, stock repurchases, retirement of debt, or expansion capital expenditures.  Management uses this performance measure and believes it provides users of our financial statements a useful performance measure reflective of our business s ability to generate cash earnings to supplement the comparable GAAP measure.  We believe the GAAP measure most directly comparable to DCF is net income available to common stockholders.  A reconciliation of DCF to net income available to common stockholders is provided in the table below.  DCF per share is DCF divided by average outstanding shares, including restricted stock awards that participate in dividends. 
    
  Segment EBDA Before Certain Items 
    
          Segment EBDA before certain items is used by management in its analysis of segment performance and management of our business.  General and administrative expenses are generally not under the control of our segment operating managers, and therefore, are not included when we measure business segment operating performance.  We believe Segment EBDA before certain items is a significant performance metric because it provides us and external users of our financial statements additional insight into the ability of our segments to generate segment cash earnings on an ongoing basis.  We believe it is useful to investors because it is a performance measure that management uses to allocate resources to our segments and assess each segment s performance.  We believe the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Segment EBDA before certain items is segment earnings before DD A and amortization of excess cost of equity investments (Segment EBDA).  
    
  In the tables for each of our business segments under    Segment Earnings Results  below, Segment EBDA before certain items is calculated by adjusting the Segment EBDA for the applicable certain item amounts, which are totaled in the tables and described in the footnotes to those tables.  

45 

Reconciliation of Net Income Available to Common Stockholders to DCF 

_______ 
           (a) 
    Consists of certain items summarized in footnotes (b) through (d) to the       Results of Operations     Consolidated Earnings Results  tables included above, and described in more detail below in the footnotes to tables included in both our management s discussion and analysis of segment results and       General and Administrative, Interest, and Noncontrolling Interests.  
              (b) 
    Represents income tax provision on certain items, plus discrete income tax certain items.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, discrete income tax items included a $276 million increase in tax expense primarily due to the impact of the sale of a 50% interest in SNG discussed in Note 8  Income Taxes  to our consolidated financial statements.

              (e) 
    Excludes book tax certain items and includes income tax allocated to the segments.  Three and nine month 2016 amounts also include $25 million and $71 million, respectively, and three and nine month 2015 amounts also include $21 million and $56 million, respectively, of our share of taxable equity investees  book tax expense. 
              (f) 
    Three and nine month 2016 amounts include $(25) million and $(59) million, respectively, and three and nine month 2015 amounts include $(2) million and $(8) million, respectively, of our share of taxable equity investees  cash taxes.  The nine months ended September 30, 2015 also excludes a $195 million income tax refund received.   
              (g) 
    Consists primarily of non-cash compensation associated with our restricted stock program. 
              (h) 
    Three and nine month 2016 amounts include $(24) million and $(66) million, respectively, and three and nine month 2015 amounts include $(16) million and $(50) million, respectively, of our share of equity investees  sustaining capital expenditures. 
              (i) 
    Includes restricted stock awards that participate in common share dividends and dilutive effect of warrants, as applicable.

     acquired pipelines are included at our ownership share for the entire period. 
    
  Below are the changes in both Segment EBDA before certain items and revenues before certain items, in the comparable three and nine month periods ended September 30,   2016   and   2015  :  
    
  Three months ended   September 30, 2016   versus Three months ended   September 30, 2015    

Nine months ended   September 30, 2016   versus Nine months ended   September 30, 2015    

The changes in Segment EBDA for our Natural Gas Pipelines business segment are further explained by the following discussion of the significant factors driving Segment EBDA before certain items in the comparable three and nine month periods ended September 30,   2016   and   2015  : 
   
   48 

decreases of $14 million (17%) and $43 million (17%), respectively, from South Texas Midstream primarily due to lower volumes, which resulted in decreases in revenue of approximately $60 million and $190 million, respectively, partially offset by decreases in costs of sales; 
                 
    decreases of $9 million (13%) and $19 million (8%), respectively, from CIG primarily due to a recent rate case settlement and lower firm reservation revenues due to contract expirations and contract renewals at lower rates; 
                 
    decrease of $8 million (7%) and flat, respectively, from EPNG.  The quarter-to-date decrease was largely due to increased pipeline integrity costs.  Year-to-date results were affected by an increase in transportation revenues from capacity sales in the Permian and mainline, offset by increased pipeline integrity costs. Revenues for both quarter-to-date and year-to-date were also lower due to decreased natural gas sales, which were largely offset by the associated cost of sales;  
                
    decreases of $5 million (38%) and $17 million (39%), respectively, from CPG primarily due to lower transport revenues as a result of contract expirations; 
                
    decreases of $3 million (43%) and $11 million (48%), respectively, from TransColorado primarily due to lower transport revenues as a result of contract expirations; 
                 
    increases of $13 million (35%) and $53 million (56%), respectively, from Hiland Midstream primarily due to favorable margins on renegotiated contracts, along with results of a full nine months from our February 2015 Hiland acquisition; and 
                
    increases of $11 million (15%) and $10 million (4%), respectively, from our Texas intrastate natural gas pipeline operations (including the operations of its Kinder Morgan Tejas, Border, Kinder Morgan Texas, North Texas and Mier-Monterrey Mexico pipeline systems) primarily due to higher storage margins partially offset by lower transportation margins as a result of lower volumes. The year-to-date decrease in revenues of $365 million resulted primarily from a decrease in sales revenue due to lower commodity prices which was largely offset by a corresponding decrease in costs of sales.

The changes in Segment EBDA for our Terminals business segment are further explained by the following discussion of the significant factors driving Segment EBDA before certain items in the comparable three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 
             
    increases of $15 million (65%) and $37 million (53%), respectively, from our Marine Operations related to the incremental earnings from the December 2015, May 2016 and July 2016 deliveries of the Jones Act tankers, the    Lone Star State,   Magnolia State,    and    Garden State,    respectively,     and increased charter rates on the    Empire State    and    Evergreen State    Jones Act tankers, partially offset by off-hire days on the    Pelican State    Jones Act tanker;  
                
    increase of $7 million (70%) and a decrease of $4 million (8%), respectively, from our Lower River terminals, primarily due to an $8 million write-off of a certain coal customer s accounts receivable which occurred in the third quarter of 2015 offset by the decreased revenues and earnings of $3 million and $17 million, respectively, due to certain coal customer bankruptcies;  
                
    increases of $3 million (9%) and $10 million (13%), respectively, from our Northeast terminals, primarily due to contributions from two terminals acquired as part of the BP Products North America Inc. acquisition which was completed in February 2016; 
                
    increases of $1 million (2%) and $15 million (8%), respectively, from our Gulf Liquids terminals, primarily related  to higher volumes as a result of various expansion projects, including marine infrastructure improvements at our Galena Park, Pasadena, and North Docks terminals, as well as higher rates and ancillary service activities on existing business; 
                
    decreases of $9 million (36%) and $32 million (41%), respectively, from our Gulf Bulk terminals, driven by decreased revenues and earnings of $10 million and $35 million, respectively, due to certain coal customer bankruptcies.

The changes in Segment EBDA for our Products Pipelines business segment are further explained by the following discussion of the significant factors driving Segment EBDA before certain items in the comparable three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 
              
    increases of $2 million (4%) and $29 million (22%), respectively, from our Kinder Morgan Crude   Condensate Pipeline driven primarily by an increase in pipeline throughput volumes from existing customers and additional volumes associated with expansion projects; 
                
    increases of $2 million (17%) and $10 million (33%), respectively, due to a full nine months of results from our Double H pipeline, which began operations in March 2015;  
                
    increases of $2 million (25%) and $2 million (8%), respectively, from our Transmix processing operations. The decreases in revenues of $59 million and $261 million, respectively, and associated decreases in costs of goods sold were driven by lower sales volumes; and 
                
    increases of $1 million (7%) and $6 million (15%), respectively, from our equity investment in Plantation Pipe Line primarily due to higher transportation revenues and lower operating costs.

The three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 earnings and loss included certain items which increased Segment EBDA by $4 million and $8 million, respectively; and three and nine month 2015 losses included certain items of a $1 million increase in earnings and a $32 million decrease in earnings, respectively.  The nine month 2015 certain items related primarily to a certain litigation matter.  After taking into effect the certain items, the losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $8 million and $4 million, respectively, when compared with the same prior year periods. 
    
  General and Administrative, Interest, and Noncontrolling Interests 

56 

Certain items 
           (a) 
    Three and nine month 2016 amounts include (i) a decrease in expense of $1 million and an increase in expense of $7 million, respectively, related to certain corporate legal matters; (ii) increases in expense of   $1 million   and   $13 million  , respectively, related to severance costs; and (iii) increases in expense of $4 million and $12 million, respectively, related to acquisition costs. Three and nine month 2015 amounts include increases in expense of (i) $1 million and $41 million, respectively, related to certain corporate legal matters; and (ii) $2 million and $14 million, respectively, related to costs associated with our Hiland acquisition.  Partially offsetting these three and nine month 2015 increases are decreases in expense of $5 million and $28 million, respectively, related to pension credit income.  
              (b) 
    Three and nine month 2016 amounts include (i) decreases in interest expense of   $47 million   and   $84 million  , respectively, related to debt fair value adjustments associated with acquisitions; and (ii) an increase in interest expense of   $16 million   and a decrease in interest expense of   $56 million  , respectively, related to non-cash true-ups of our estimates of swap ineffectiveness.  Three and nine month 2015 amounts include increases in interest expense of $33 million and $3 million, respectively, related to non-cash true-ups of our estimates of swap ineffectiveness and decreases in interest expense of $18 million and $53 million, respectively, related to debt fair value adjustments associated with acquisitions. Nine month 2015 amount also includes a decrease in interest expense of $13 million associated with a certain Pacific operations litigation matter and a $23 million increase in interest expense for a non-cash adjustment related to a certain legal matter. 
              (c) 
    Nine month 2016 amount includes a loss of   $9 million  , and nine month 2015 amount includes a loss of $14 million associated with Natural Gas Pipelines segment certain items and disclosed above in   Natural Gas Pipelines.   Three and nine month 2015 amounts include a $6 million loss associated with a terminals segment certain item and disclosed above in   Terminals.    
     Other 
           (d) 
    Three and nine month 2016 amounts include $8 million and $25 million, respectively, and three and nine month 2015 amounts include $10 million and $28 million, respectively, of general and administrative management fee revenues from an equity investee.   These amounts were recorded to the  Product sales and other  caption with the offsetting expenses primarily included in the  General and administrative  expense caption in our accompanying consolidated statements of income. 
       
  General and administrative expenses before certain items for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the respective prior periods increased   $7 million   and   $8 million  , respectively.  The quarter-to-date increase from 2015 was primarily driven by higher benefit costs partially offset by higher capitalized costs and lower labor expenses.  The year-to-date increase from 2015 was primarily driven by higher benefit costs and lower capitalized costs partially offset by lower labor and outside services expenses. 
    
  In the table above, we report our interest expense as  net,  meaning that we have subtracted unallocated interest income.  Our consolidated interest expense net of interest income and other, net before certain items for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the respective prior periods decreased   $19 million   and   $39 million  , respectively. The decreases in interest expense were due to lower weighted average debt balances, partially offset by a slightly higher overall weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt  . 
    
  We use interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of the underlying cash flows related to our long-term fixed rate debt securities (senior notes) into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, approximately 28% and 27%, respectively, of our debt balances (excluding debt fair value adjustments) were subject to variable interest rates either as short-term or long-term variable rate debt obligations or  
  
   57 

as fixed-rate debt converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps.  For more information on our interest rate swaps, see Note 5  Risk Management   Interest Rate Risk Management    to our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, represents the allocation of our consolidated net income attributable to all outstanding ownership interests in our consolidated subsidiaries that are not owned by us.  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests before certain items for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the respective prior periods increased   $2 million   and was flat, respectively.  
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  The $269 million and $223 million increases in tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015 were primarily due to the impact of the sale of a 50% interest in SNG discussed in Note 8  Income Taxes  to our consolidated financial statements, partially offset by lower 2016 pre-tax earnings. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  General 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $357 million   of  Cash and cash equivalents,  an increase of   $128 million   (56%) from   December 31, 2015  .  We believe our cash position, remaining borrowing capacity on our credit facility (discussed below in   Short-term Liquidity ), and cash flows from operating activities are adequate to allow us to manage our day-to-day cash requirements and anticipated obligations as discussed further below. 
    
  We have consistently generated strong cash flow from operations, providing a source of funds of   $3,495 million   and   $3,507 million   in the first   nine   months of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The period-to-period decrease is discussed below in  Cash Flows Operating Activities .  We have relied on cash provided from operations to fund our operations as well as our debt service, sustaining capital expenditures, and dividend payments, and during 2016, to fund our expansion capital expenditures. 
    
  On September 1, 2016, we completed the sale of a   50%   interest in our SNG natural gas pipeline system to Southern Company, receiving proceeds of approximately   $1.4 billion  .  Inclusive of existing SNG debt, the transaction equates to an SNG total enterprise value of   $4.15 billion  .  We used the proceeds from this transaction to reduce outstanding debt.  As of September 1, 2016, SNG had   $1,211 million   of debt outstanding (including a current portion of   $500 million  ) which is no longer consolidated on our balance sheet.  In addition to repaying outstanding commercial paper and credit facility borrowings, proceeds from the sale of the 50% interest in SNG were also used on September 30, 2016 to repay the   $332 million   principal amount of Copano s   7.125%   notes due 2021, and on October 1, 2016, to repay the   $749 million   principal amount of Hiland s   7.25%   senior notes due 2020 (see Note 3  Debt ). 
    
  On January 26, 2016, we announced the issuance of a new   $1.0 billion   unsecured term loan facility and the expansion of our revolving credit facility from   $4.0 billion   to   $5.0 billion  .  The proceeds of the three-year unsecured term loan facility were used to refinance maturing long-term debt. 
    
  On August 16, 2016, CIG completed a private offering of   $375 million   in principal amount of   4.15%   senior notes due August 15, 2026.  We received net proceeds of   $372 million   from the offering and used the proceeds from the sale of the notes to reduce debt incurred as the result of the repayment of CIG s senior notes that matured in 2015 and for general corporate purposes. 
    
  In general, we expect that our short-term liquidity needs will be met primarily through retained cash from operations or short-term borrowings.  We also expect that our current common stock dividend level will allow us to use retained cash to fund our growth projects in 2016.  Moreover, by continuing to focus on high-grading our growth project backlog to allocate capital to the highest return opportunities, we do not expect to need to access the capital markets to fund our growth projects for the foreseeable future beyond 2016. 
    
  Short-term Liquidity 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our principal sources of short-term liquidity are (i) our   $5.0 billion   revolving credit facility and associated   $4.0 billion   commercial paper program and (ii) cash from operations.  The loan commitments under our revolving credit facility can be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes and as a backup to our commercial paper program.  Borrowings under our commercial paper program and letters of credit reduce borrowings allowed under our credit  
  
   58 

facility.  We provide for liquidity by maintaining a sizable amount of excess borrowing capacity under our credit facility and, as previously discussed,  have consistently generated strong cash flows from operations. 
    
  Our short-term debt as of   September 30, 2016   was   $2,944 million  , primarily consisting of   $2,790 million   of senior notes that mature in the next year.  We intend to refinance our short-term debt through additional credit facility borrowings, commercial paper borrowings, or by issuing new long-term debt or paying down short-term debt using cash retained from operations or received from asset sales.  Our short-term debt balance as of   December 31, 2015   was   $821 million  . 
    
  We had working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) deficits of   $2,681 million   and   $1,241 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Our current liabilities may include short-term borrowings used to finance our expansion capital expenditures, which we may periodically replace with long-term financing and/or partially pay down using retained cash from operations.  The overall   $1,440 million   (116%) unfavorable change from year-end   2015   was primarily due to a net increase in our current portion of long term debt, offset partially by a favorable change in cash and  restricted deposits resulting from proceeds received from our sale of a 50% interest in SNG.  Generally, our working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments, timing differences in the collection and payment of receivables and payables, the change in fair value of our derivative contracts, and changes in our cash and cash equivalent balances as a result of excess cash from operations after payments for investing and financing activities. 
    
  Capital Expenditures  
    
  We account for our capital expenditures in accordance with GAAP. We also distinguish between capital expenditures that are maintenance/sustaining capital expenditures and those that are expansion capital expenditures (which we also refer to as discretionary capital expenditures).  Expansion capital expenditures are those expenditures which increase throughput or capacity from that which existed immediately prior to the addition or improvement, and are not deducted in calculating DCF (see  Results of Operations Distributable Cash Flow ). With respect to our oil and gas producing activities, we classify a capital expenditure as an expansion capital expenditure if it is expected to increase capacity or throughput (i.e., production capacity) from the capacity or throughput immediately prior to the making or acquisition of such additions or improvements. Maintenance capital expenditures are those which maintain throughput or capacity. The distinction between maintenance and expansion capital expenditures is a physical determination rather than an economic one, irrespective of the amount by which the throughput or capacity is increased. 
    
  Budgeting of maintenance capital expenditures is done annually on a bottom-up basis. For each of our assets, we budget for and make those maintenance capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain safe and efficient operations, meet customer needs and comply with our operating policies and applicable law. We may budget for and make additional maintenance capital expenditures that we expect to produce economic benefits such as increasing efficiency and/or lowering future expenses. Budgeting and approval of expansion capital expenditures are generally made periodically throughout the year on a project-by-project basis in response to specific investment opportunities identified by our business segments from which we generally expect to receive sufficient returns to justify the expenditures. Generally, the determination of whether a capital expenditure is classified as maintenance/sustaining or as expansion capital expenditures is made on a project level. The classification of our capital expenditures as expansion capital expenditures or as maintenance capital expenditures is made consistent with our accounting policies and is generally a straightforward process, but in certain circumstances can be a matter of management judgment and discretion.  The classification has an impact on cash available to pay dividends because capital expenditures that are classified as expansion capital expenditures are not deducted from DCF, while those classified as maintenance capital expenditures are.  See   Common Dividends.  

59 

Our capital expenditures for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and the amount we expect to spend for the remainder of 2016 to sustain and grow our businesses are as follows:    

  _______ 
           (a) 
    Nine  -months 2016, 2016 Remaining, and Total 2016 amounts include $66 million, $28 million, and $94 million, respectively, for our proportionate share of sustaining capital expenditures of unconsolidated joint ventures. 
              (b) 
    Nine-months 2016 amount includes an increase of $588 million of discretionary capital expenditures of unconsolidated joint ventures (including a NGPL Holdings LLC contribution) and acquisitions (primarily BP terminals acquisition) and divestitures and a decrease of a combined $263 million of net changes from accrued capital expenditures and contractor retainage.  
              (c) 
    2016 Remaining amount includes our contributions to certain unconsolidated joint ventures and small acquisitions and divestitures, net of contributions estimated from unaffiliated joint venture members for consolidated investments.

  Other than commitments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment discussed below, there have been no material changes in our obligations with respect to other entities that are not consolidated in our financial statements that would affect the disclosures presented as of   December 31, 2015   in our   2015   Form 10-K.  KMI expects to be released from its guarantor obligation with respect to SNG s $1,211 million of public notes in December of 2016. 
    
  Commitments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $1,567 million and $1,229 million, respectively. The $338 million increase is primarily the result of our increase in various capital commitments associated with our natural gas pipeline business segment. 
    
  Cash Flows 
    
  Operating Activities 
    
  The net decrease of $12 million in cash provided by operating activities for the nine months of 2016 compared to the respective 2015 period was primarily attributable to: 

a $139 million decrease in cash from overall net income after adjusting our period-to-period $438 million decrease in net income for non-cash items primarily consisting of the following: (i) net losses on impairments and divestitures (see discussion above in   Results of Operations  (ii) losses on impairment and disposals of equity investments primarily due to the impairment of our equity investment in MEP (see discussion above in   Results of Operations  (iii) changes in DD A expenses (including amortization of excess cost of equity investments) and deferred income taxes; and (iv) change in earnings from equity investments; and  
                
    a $127 million increase associated with net changes in non-current assets and liabilities offset partially by a net decrease in working capital items. The net increase in non-current assets and liabilities was driven, in large part, by realized gains on derivative contracts used to hedge forecasted natural gas, NGL and crude oil sales.  The decrease in working capital was primarily due to a non-recurring $195 million income tax refund and a $73 million payment under a take-or-pay contract that we received in 2015, offset partially by higher cash flow due to the timing of payments from our trade payables.  
       
  Investing Activities 
  The $3,675 million net decrease in cash used in investing activities for the nine months of 2016 compared to the respective 2015 period was primarily attributable to: 
             
    a $1,586 million decrease in expenditures for acquisitions and investments in 2016 compared to the respective 2015 period. The overall decrease in acquisitions was primarily related to the $324 million portion of the purchase price we paid in 2016 for the BP terminals acquisition, versus $1,706 million (net of cash assumed) and $158 million we paid for the Hiland and Vopak acquisitions, respectively, in the 2015 period;  
                
    a $1,402 million net increase in cash due to proceeds from the sale of a 50% equity interest in SNG; 
     
   60 

an $890 million reduction in capital expenditures; and 
                
    a $205 million increase in cash from proceeds of sales of other long-lived assets; partially offset by, 
                 
    a $101 million decrease in cash primarily due to unfavorable changes in restricted deposits associated with our hedging activities. 
       
  Financing Activities 
  The net decrease of $3,410 million in cash provided by financing activities for the nine months of 2016 compared to the respective 2015 period was primarily attributable to: 
             
    a $3,833 million decrease in cash resulting from the issuances of our Class P shares under our equity distribution agreement in 2015 and no activity in 2016; 
                
    a $1,033 million net decrease in net debt proceeds. See Note 3  Debt  for further information regarding our debt activity;  
                 
    a $115 million decrease in cash due to dividends paid to our mandatory convertible preferred shareholders in 2016; 
     partially offset by, 
             
    a $2,245 million reduction in dividend payments paid to our common shareholders; and 
                
    an $81 million increase in contributions provided by noncontrolling interests, primarily reflecting the contributions received from BP for its 25% share of a newly formed joint venture. 
       
  Common Dividends  
    
  We expect to declare common dividends of $0.50 per share on our common stock for 2016 ($0.125/quarter). 

The actual amount of common dividends to be paid on our capital stock will depend on many factors, including our financial condition and results of operations, liquidity requirements, business prospects, capital requirements, legal, regulatory and contractual constraints, tax laws, Delaware laws and other factors.  See Item 1A.  Risk Factors   The guidance we provide for our anticipated dividends is based on estimates.  Circumstances may arise that lead to conflicts between using funds to pay anticipated dividends or to invest in our business.    of our 2015 Form 10-K.  All of these matters will be taken into consideration by our board of directors in declaring dividends. 
    
  Our common stock dividends are not cumulative.  Consequently, if dividends on our common stock are not paid at the intended levels, our common stockholders are not entitled to receive those payments in the future.  Our common stock dividends generally are expected to be paid on or about the 15th day of each February, May, August and November. 
    
  Preferred Dividends    
  Dividends on our mandatory convertible preferred stock are payable on a cumulative basis when, as and if declared by our board of directors (or an authorized committee thereof) at an annual rate of 9.750% of the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share on January 26, April 26, July 26 and October 26 of each year, commencing on January 26, 2016 to, and including, October 26, 2018.  We may pay dividends in cash or, subject to certain limitations, in shares of common stock or any combination of cash and shares of common stock.  The terms of the mandatory convertible preferred stock provide that, unless full cumulative dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding mandatory convertible preferred stock for all prior dividend periods, no dividends may be declared or paid on common stock. 
  
   61 

The cash dividend of   $24.375   per share of our mandatory convertible preferred stock is equivalent to   $1.21875   per depository share. 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
  There have been no material changes in market risk exposures that would affect the quantitative and qualitative disclosures presented as of December 31,   2015  , in Item 7A in our   2015   Form 10-K.  For more information on our risk management activities, see Item 1, Note 5  Risk Management  to our consolidated financial statements.  

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.  Based upon and as of the date of the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file and submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

that, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, (i) such Guarantor (as opposed to its creditors, representatives of creditors or bankruptcy trustee, including such Guarantor in its capacity as debtor in possession exercising any powers of a bankruptcy trustee) has no personal right under such laws to reduce, or request any judicial relief that has the effect of reducing, the amount of its liability under this Agreement, (ii) such Guarantor (as opposed to its creditors, representatives of creditors or bankruptcy trustee, including such Guarantor in its capacity as debtor in possession exercising any powers of a bankruptcy trustee) has no personal right to enforce the limitation set forth in this   Section 2(e)   or to reduce, or request judicial relief reducing, the amount of its liability under this Agreement, and (iii) the limitation set forth in this   Section 2(e)   may be enforced only to the extent required under such laws in order for the obligations of such Guarantor under this Agreement to be enforceable under such laws and only by or for the benefit of a creditor, representative of creditors or bankruptcy trustee of such Guarantor or other Person entitled, under such laws, to enforce the provisions hereof. 
  3.        Right of Contribution  .  Each Guarantor hereby agrees that to the extent that a Guarantor shall have paid more than its proportionate share of any payment made hereunder (including by way of set-off rights being exercised against it), such Guarantor shall be entitled to seek and receive contribution from and against any other Guarantor hereunder who has not paid its proportionate share of such payment as set forth in this   Section 3  .  To the extent that any Guarantor shall be required hereunder to pay any portion of any Guaranteed Obligation guaranteed hereunder exceeding the greater of (a) the amount of the value actually received by such Guarantor and its Subsidiaries from such Guaranteed Obligation and (b) the amount such Guarantor would otherwise have paid if such Guarantor had paid the aggregate amount of such Guaranteed Obligation guaranteed hereunder (excluding the amount thereof repaid by the Issuer of such Guaranteed Obligation) in the same proportion as such Guarantor s net worth on the date enforcement is sought hereunder bears to the aggregate net worth of all the Guarantors on such date, then such Guarantor shall be reimbursed by such other Guarantors for the amount of such excess, pro rata, based on the respective net worth of such other Guarantors on such date;   provided   that any Guarantor s right of reimbursement shall be subject to the terms and conditions of   Section 5   hereof.  For purposes of determining the net worth of any Guarantor in connection with the foregoing, all Guarantees of such Guarantor other than pursuant to this Agreement will be deemed to be enforceable and payable after its obligations pursuant to this Agreement.  The provisions of this   Section 3   shall in no respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor to the Guaranteed Parties, and each Guarantor shall remain liable to the Guaranteed Parties for the full amount guaranteed by such Guarantor hereunder. 
  4.        No Right of Set-off  .  No Guaranteed Party shall have, as a result of this Agreement, any right of set-off against any amount owing by such Guaranteed Party to or for the credit or the account of a Guarantor. 
  5.        No Subrogation  .  Notwithstanding any payment or payments made by any of the Guarantors hereunder, no Guarantor shall be entitled to be subrogated to any of the rights (or if subrogated by operation of law, such Guarantor hereby waives such rights to the extent permitted by applicable law) of any Guaranteed Party against any Issuer or any other Guarantor or any collateral security or guarantee or right of offset held by any Guaranteed Party for the payment of any Guaranteed Obligation, nor shall any Guarantor seek or be entitled to seek any contribution or reimbursement from any Issuer or any other Guarantor in respect of payments made by such Guarantor hereunder, until the Guarantee Termination Date.  If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor on account of such subrogation, contribution or reimbursement rights at any time prior to the Guarantee Termination Date, such amount shall be held by such Guarantor in trust for the applicable Guaranteed Parties, segregated from other funds of such Guarantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Guarantor, be turned over to the applicable Guaranteed Parties in the exact form received by such Guarantor (duly indorsed by such  
  
   7 

    Exhibit 10.1 

Guarantor to the applicable Guaranteed Parties if required), to be applied against the applicable Guaranteed Obligation, whether due or to become due. 
  6.        Amendments, etc. with Respect to the Guaranteed Obligations; Waiver of Rights; Release  . 
  (a)        Each Guarantor shall remain obligated hereunder notwithstanding that, without any reservation of rights against any Guarantor and without notice to or further assent by any Guarantor, (i) any demand for payment of any Guaranteed Obligation made by any Guaranteed Party may be rescinded by such party and any Guaranteed Obligation continued, (ii) a Guaranteed Obligation, or the liability of any other party upon or for any part thereof, or any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated, compromised, waived, allowed to lapse, surrendered or released by any Guaranteed Party, (iii) the instruments governing any Guaranteed Obligation may be amended, modified, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, and (iv) any collateral security, guarantee or right of offset at any time held by any Guaranteed Party for the payment of any Guaranteed Obligation may be sold, exchanged, waived, allowed to lapse, surrendered or released.  No Guaranteed Party shall have any obligation to protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien at any time held by it as security for the Guaranteed Obligations or for this Agreement or any property subject thereto.  When making any demand hereunder against any Guarantor, a Guaranteed Party may, but shall be under no obligation to, make a similar demand on the Issuer of the applicable Guaranteed Obligation or any other Guarantor or any other person, and any failure by a Guaranteed Party to make any such demand or to collect any payments from such Issuer or any other Guarantor or any other person or any release of such Issuer or any other Guarantor or any other person shall not relieve any Guarantor in respect of which a demand or collection is not made or any Guarantor not so released of its several obligations or liabilities hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, express or implied, or as a matter of law, of any Guaranteed Party against any Guarantor.  For the purposes hereof  demand  shall include the commencement and continuance of any legal proceedings. 
  (b)        A Guarantor shall be automatically released from its guarantee hereunder upon release of such Guarantor from the Revolving Credit Agreement Guarantee, including upon consummation of any transaction resulting in such Guarantor ceasing to constitute a Subsidiary or upon any Guarantor becoming an Excluded Subsidiary (such transaction or event, a    Release Event   ).   
  (c)        Upon the occurrence of a Release Event, each Guaranteed Obligation for which such released Guarantor was the Issuer shall be automatically released from the provisions of this Agreement and shall cease to constitute a Guaranteed Obligation hereunder;   provided   that in the case of any Guaranteed Obligation that has been assigned an Investment Grade Rating by the Rating Agencies, such Guaranteed Obligation shall be so released, effective as of the 91   st    day after the occurrence of the Release Event, if and only if a Rating Decline with respect to such Guaranteed Obligation does not occur.  
  7.        Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional  . 
  (a)        Each Guarantor waives any and all notice of the creation, contraction, incurrence, renewal, extension, amendment, waiver or accrual of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, and notice of or proof of reliance by any Guaranteed Party upon this Agreement or acceptance of this Agreement.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives diligence, promptness, presentment, protest and notice of protest, demand for payment or performance, notice of default or nonpayment, notice of acceptance and any other notice in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part of them, and any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of any Issuer or any of the Guarantors  
  
   8 

    Exhibit 10.1 

with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations.  Each Guarantor understands and agrees that this Agreement shall be construed as a continuing, absolute and unconditional guarantee of payment without regard to (i) the validity, regularity or enforceability of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the indenture, loan agreement, note or other instrument evidencing or governing any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any collateral security therefor or guarantee or right of offset with respect thereto at any time or from time to time held by any Guaranteed Party, (ii) any defense, set-off or counterclaim (other than a defense of payment or performance) that may at any time be available to or be asserted by any Issuer against any Guaranteed Party or (iii) any other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of any Issuer or such Guarantor) that constitutes, or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of any Issuer for any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or of such Guarantor under this Agreement, in bankruptcy or in any other instance.  When pursuing its rights and remedies hereunder against any Guarantor, any Guaranteed Party may, but shall be under no obligation to, pursue such rights and remedies as it may have against the Issuer or any other Person or against any collateral security or guarantee for the Guaranteed Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by any Guaranteed Party to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from the Issuer or any such other Person or to realize upon any such collateral security or guarantee or to exercise any such right of offset, or any release of the Issuer or any such other Person or any such collateral security, guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve such Guarantor of any liability hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of the other Guaranteed Parties against such Guarantor. 
  (b)        This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and be binding in accordance with and to the extent of its terms upon each Guarantor and the successors and assigns thereof and shall inure to the benefit of the Guaranteed Parties and their respective successors, indorsees, transferees and assigns until the Guarantee Termination Date. 
  8.        Reinstatement  .  This Agreement shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by any Guaranteed Party upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of any Issuer or any Guarantor, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, any Issuer or any Guarantor or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made. 
  9.        Payments  .  Each Guarantor hereby guarantees that payments hereunder will be paid to the applicable Guaranteed Parties without set-off or counterclaim in dollars. 
  10.        Representations and Warranties  .  Each Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to each Guaranteed Party that the following representations and warranties are true and correct in all material respects as of the date of this Agreement or as of the date such Guarantor became a party to this Agreement, as applicable: 
  (a)        such Guarantor (i) is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company duly organized or formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of its incorporation, organization or formation, (ii) has all requisite corporate, partnership, limited liability company or other power and all material governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted and (iii) is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in every jurisdiction in which the failure to be so qualified would have a material adverse effect on its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement; 
  
   9 

    Exhibit 10.1 

(b)        such Guarantor has all requisite corporate (or other organizational) power and authority to execute and deliver and to perform its obligations under this Agreement, and all such actions have been duly authorized by all necessary proceedings on its behalf;  
  (c)        this Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by or on behalf of such Guarantor and constitutes the valid and legally binding agreement of such Guarantor, enforceable against such Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except (i) as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer, fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors  rights generally, and by general principles of equity (including principles of good faith, reasonableness, materiality and fair dealing) which may, among other things, limit the right to obtain equitable remedies (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (ii) as to the enforceability of provisions for indemnification for violation of applicable securities laws, limitations thereon arising as a matter of law or public policy; 
  (d)        no authorization, consent, approval, license or exemption of or registration, declaration or filing with any Governmental Authority is necessary for the valid execution and delivery of, or the performance by such Guarantor of its obligations hereunder, except those that have been obtained and such matters relating to performance as would ordinarily be done in the ordinary course of business after the date of this Agreement or as of the date such Guarantor became a party to this Agreement, as applicable; and 
  (e)        neither the execution and delivery of, nor the performance by such Guarantor of its obligations under, this Agreement will (i) breach or violate any applicable Requirement of Law, (ii) result in any breach or violation of any of the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of (or the obligation to create or impose) any Lien upon any of its property or assets (other than Liens created or contemplated by this Agreement) pursuant to the terms of, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, agreement or other instrument to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is party or by which any of its properties or assets, or those of any of its Subsidiaries is bound or to which it is subject, except for breaches, violations and defaults under clauses (i) and (ii) that neither individually nor in the aggregate could reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement, or (iii) violate any provision of the organizational documents of such Guarantor. 
  11.        Rights of Guaranteed Parties  .  Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that any changes in the identity of the Persons from time to time comprising the Guaranteed Parties gives rise to an equivalent change in the Guaranteed Parties, without any further act.  Upon such an occurrence, the persons then comprising the Guaranteed Parties are vested with the rights, remedies and discretions of the Guaranteed Parties under this Agreement. 
  12.        Notices  . 
  (a)        All notices, requests, demands and other communications to any Guarantor pursuant hereto shall be in writing and mailed, telecopied or delivered to such Guarantor in care of KMI, 1001 Louisiana Street, Suite 1000, Houston, Texas 77002, Attention: Treasurer, Telecopy: (713) 445-8302. 
  (b)        KMI will provide a copy of this Agreement, including the most recently amended schedules and supplements hereto, to any Guaranteed Party upon written request to the address set forth in   Section 12(a)  ;   provided, however  , that KMI s obligations under this   Section 12(b)   shall be deemed satisfied if KMI has filed a copy of this Agreement, including the most recently amended schedules and  
  
   10 

    Exhibit 10.1 

supplements hereto, with the SEC within three months preceding the date on which KMI receives such written request. 
  13.        Counterparts  .  This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts (including by facsimile or other electronic transmission), and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.  A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the parties shall be lodged with KMI. 
  14.        Severability  .  Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.  The parties hereto shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions. 
  15.        Integration  .  This Agreement represents the agreement of each Guarantor with respect to the subject matter hereof, and there are no promises, undertakings, representations or warranties by any Guaranteed Party relative to the subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein. 
  16.        Amendments; No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. 
  (a)        None of the terms or provisions of this Agreement may be waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except by a written instrument executed by the affected Guarantors and KMI. 
  (b)        The Guarantors may amend or supplement this Agreement by a written instrument executed by all Guarantors: 
  (i)  to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency; 
  (ii)  to reflect a change in the Guarantors or the Guaranteed Obligations made in accordance with this Agreement; 
  (iii)  to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Guaranteed Parties or that would not adversely affect the legal rights hereunder of any Guaranteed Party in any material respect; or 
  (iv)  to conform this Agreement to any change made to the Revolving Credit Agreement or to the Revolving Credit Agreement Guarantee. 
  Except as set forth in this clause (b) or otherwise provided herein, the Guarantors may not amend, supplement or otherwise modify this Agreement prior to the Guarantee Termination Date without the prior written consent of the holders of the majority of the outstanding principal amount of the Guaranteed Obligations (excluding obligations with respect to Hedging Agreements).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an amendment that would reasonably be expected to adversely, materially and disproportionately affect Guaranteed Parties with Guaranteed Obligations existing under Hedging Agreements relative to the other Guaranteed Parties, the foregoing exclusion of obligations with respect to Hedging Agreements shall not apply, and the outstanding principal amount attributable to each such Guaranteed Party s Guaranteed Obligations shall be deemed to be equal to the termination payment that  
  
   11 

    Exhibit 10.1 

would be due to such Guaranteed Party as if the valuation date were an  Early Termination Date  under and calculated in accordance with each applicable Hedging Agreement. 
  (c)        No Guaranteed Party shall by any act, delay, indulgence, omission or otherwise be deemed to have waived any right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any breach of any of the terms and conditions hereof.  No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of any Guaranteed Party, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof.  No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.  A waiver by a Guaranteed Party of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy that such Guaranteed Party would otherwise have on any future occasion. 
  (d)        The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative, may be exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided by law. 
  17.        Section Headings  .  The Section headings used in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and are not to affect the construction hereof or be taken into consideration in the interpretation hereof. 
  18.        Successors and Assigns  .  This Agreement shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of each Guarantor and shall inure to the benefit of the Guaranteed Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except that no Guarantor may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement except pursuant to a transaction permitted by the Revolving Credit Agreement and in connection with a corresponding assignment under the Revolving Credit Agreement Guarantee. 
  19.        Additional Guarantors  . 
  (a)        KMI shall cause each Subsidiary (other than any Excluded Subsidiary) formed or otherwise purchased or acquired after the date of this Agreement (including each Subsidiary that ceases to constitute an Excluded Subsidiary after the date of this Agreement) to execute a supplement to this Agreement and become a Guarantor within 45 days of the occurrence of the applicable event specified in this   Section 19(a)  . 
  (b)        Each Subsidiary of KMI that becomes, at the request of KMI, or that is required pursuant to   Section 19(a)   to become, a party to this Agreement shall become a Guarantor, with the same force and effect as if originally named as a Guarantor herein, for all purposes of this Agreement upon execution and delivery by such Subsidiary of a written supplement substantially in the form of   Annex A   hereto.  The execution and delivery of any instrument adding an additional Guarantor as a party to this Agreement shall not require the consent of any other Guarantor hereunder.  The rights and obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the addition of any new Guarantor as a party to this Agreement. 
  20.        Additional Guaranteed Obligations  .  Any Indebtedness issued by a Guarantor or for which a Guarantor otherwise becomes obligated after the date of this Agreement shall become a Guaranteed Obligation upon the execution by all Guarantors of a notation of guarantee substantially in the form of   Annex B   hereto, which shall be affixed to the instrument or instruments evidencing such Indebtedness. Each such notation of guarantee shall be signed on behalf of each Guarantor by a duly authorized officer prior to the authentication or issuance of such Indebtedness. 
  
   12 

    Exhibit 10.1 

21.        GOVERNING LAW  .  THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. 
  22.        Keepwell  .  Each Qualified ECP Guarantor hereby jointly and severally absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support as may be needed from time to time by each other Guarantor to honor all of its obligations under this Agreement in respect of Swap Obligations (provided, however, that each Qualified ECP Guarantor shall only be liable under this Section 22 for the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering its obligations under this Section 22, or otherwise under this Agreement, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount). The obligations of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section shall remain in full force and effect until the Guarantee Termination Date. Each Qualified ECP Guarantor intends that this Section 22 constitute, and this Section 22 shall be deemed to constitute, a  keepwell, support, or other agreement  for the benefit of each other Guarantor for all purposes of Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.

Unless otherwise defined herein, terms defined in the Agreement and used herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Agreement. 
  A.    The Guarantors consist of Kinder Morgan, Inc., a Delaware corporation (   KMI   ), and certain of its direct and indirect Subsidiaries, and the Guarantors have entered into the Agreement in order to provide guarantees of certain of the Guarantors  senior, unsecured Indebtedness outstanding from time to time. 
  B.      Section 19   of the Agreement provides that additional Subsidiaries may become Guarantors under the Agreement by execution and delivery of an instrument in the form of this Supplement.  Each undersigned Subsidiary (each a    New Guarantor   ) is executing this Supplement at the request of KMI or in accordance with the requirements of the Agreement to become a Guarantor under the Agreement. 
  Accordingly, each New Guarantor agrees as follows: 
  SECTION 1.    In accordance with   Section 19   of the Agreement, each New Guarantor by its signature below becomes a Guarantor under the Agreement with the same force and effect as if originally named therein as a Guarantor and each New Guarantor hereby (a) agrees to all the terms and provisions of the Agreement applicable to it as a Guarantor thereunder and (b) represents and warrants that the representations and warranties made by it as a Guarantor thereunder are true and correct on and as of the date hereof.  Each reference to a Guarantor in the Agreement shall be deemed to include each New Guarantor.  The Agreement is hereby incorporated herein by reference. 
  SECTION 2.     Each New Guarantor represents and warrants to the Guaranteed Parties that this Supplement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by it and constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms. 
  SECTION 3.    This Supplement may be executed by one or more of the parties to this Supplement on any number of separate counterparts (including by facsimile or other electronic transmission), and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.  A set of the copies of this Supplement signed by all the parties shall be lodged with KMI.  This Supplement shall become effective as to each New Guarantor when KMI shall have received a counterpart of this Supplement that bears the signature of such New Guarantor. 
  SECTION 4.    Except as expressly supplemented hereby, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. 
  SECTION 5.    THIS SUPPLEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

Any provision of this Supplement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof and in the Agreement, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.  The parties hereto shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions. 
  SECTION 7.    All notices, requests and demands pursuant hereto shall be made in accordance with   Section 12   of the Agreement.  All communications and notices hereunder to each New Guarantor shall be given to it in care of KMI at the address set forth in   Section 12   of the Agreement.

              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              (a) 
    designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              (b) 
    designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States; 
              (c) 
    evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and

    disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              (a) 
    all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              (b) 
    any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
