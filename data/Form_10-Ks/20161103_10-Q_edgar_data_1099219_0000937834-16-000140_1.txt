As used in this Form 10     Q,  MetLife,  the  Company,   we,   our  and  us  refer to MetLife, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1999, its subsidiaries and affiliates. 
  Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q, including Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, may contain or incorporate by reference information that includes or is based upon forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements give expectations or forecasts of future events. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as  anticipate,   estimate,   expect,   project,   intend,   plan,   believe  and other words and terms of similar meaning, or are tied to future periods, in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective services or products, future performance or results of current and anticipated services or products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, trends in operations and financial results. 
  Any or all forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many such factors will be important in determining the actual future results of MetLife, Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliates. These statements are based on current expectations and the current economic environment. They involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. These statements are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that might cause such differences include the risks, uncertainties and other factors identified in MetLife, Inc. s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. These factors include: (1) difficult conditions in the global capital markets; (2) increased volatility and disruption of the global capital and credit markets, which may affect our ability to meet liquidity needs and access capital, including through our credit facilities, generate fee income and market-related revenue and finance statutory reserve requirements and may require us to pledge collateral or make payments related to declines in value of specified assets, including assets supporting risks ceded to certain of our captive reinsurers or hedging arrangements associated with those risks; (3) exposure to global financial and capital market risks, including as a result of the pending withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, other disruption in Europe and possible withdrawal of one or more countries from the Euro zone; (4) impact on us of comprehensive financial services regulation reform, including potential regulation of MetLife, Inc. as a non-bank systemically important financial institution, or otherwise; (5) numerous rulemaking initiatives required or permitted by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act which may impact how we conduct our business, including those compelling the liquidation of certain financial institutions; (6) regulatory, legislative or tax changes relating to our insurance, international, or other operations that may affect the cost of, or demand for, our products or services, or increase the cost or administrative burdens of providing benefits to employees; (7) adverse results or other consequences from litigation, arbitration or regulatory investigations; (8) unanticipated developments that could delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect the separation of Brighthouse Financial; (9) our ability to address difficulties, unforeseen liabilities, asset impairments, or rating agency actions arising from (a) business acquisitions and integrating and managing the growth of such acquired businesses, (b) dispositions of businesses via sale, initial public offering, spin-off or otherwise, including failure to achieve projected operational benefit from such transactions; (c) entry into joint ventures, or (d) legal entity reorganizations; (10) potential liquidity and other risks resulting from our participation in a securities lending program and other transactions; including any separated business  incurrence of debt in connection with such a separation; (11) investment losses and defaults, and changes to investment valuations; (12) changes in assumptions related to investment valuations, deferred policy acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements, value of business acquired or goodwill; (13) impairments of goodwill and realized losses or market value impairments to illiquid assets; (14) defaults on our mortgage loans; (15) the defaults or deteriorating credit of other financial institutions that could adversely affect us; (16) economic, political, legal, currency and other risks relating to our international operations, including with respect to fluctuations of exchange rates; (17) downgrades in our claims paying ability, financial strength or credit ratings; (18) a deterioration in the experience of the closed block established in connection with the reorganization of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company; (19) availability and effectiveness of reinsurance, hedging or indemnification arrangements, as well as any default or failure of counterparties to perform; (20) differences between actual claims experience and underwriting and reserving assumptions; (21) ineffectiveness of risk management policies and procedures; (22) catastrophe losses; (23) increasing cost and limited market capacity for statutory life insurance reserve financings; (24) heightened competition, including with respect to pricing, entry of new competitors, consolidation of distributors, the development of new products by new and existing competitors, and for personnel; (25) exposure to losses related to variable annuity guarantee benefits, including from significant and sustained downturns or extreme volatility in equity markets, reduced interest rates, unanticipated policyholder behavior, mortality or longevity, and any adjustment for nonperformance risk; (26) legal, regulatory and other restrictions affecting MetLife, Inc. s ability to pay dividends and repurchase common stock; (27) MetLife, Inc. s and its subsidiary holding companies  primary reliance, as holding companies, on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its free cash flow targets and debt payment obligations and the applicable regulatory restrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries to pay such dividends; (28) the possibility that MetLife, Inc. s Board of Directors may influence the outcome of stockholder votes through the voting provisions of the MetLife Policyholder Trust; (29) changes in accounting standards, practices and/or policies; (30) increased expenses relating to pension and postretirement benefit plans, as well as health care and other employee benefits; (31) inability to protect our intellectual property rights or claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others; (32) difficulties in marketing and distributing products through our distribution channels; (33) provisions of laws and our incorporation documents may delay, deter or prevent takeovers and corporate combinations involving MetLife; (34) the effects of business disruption or economic contraction due to disasters such as terrorist attacks, cyberattacks, other hostilities, or natural catastrophes, including any related impact on the value of our investment portfolio, our disaster recovery systems, cyber- or other information security systems and management continuity planning; (35) any failure to protect the confidentiality of client information; (36) the effectiveness of our programs and practices in avoiding giving our associates incentives to take excessive risks; (37) restrictions, liabilities, losses or indemnification obligations arising from any transitional services or tax arrangements related to the separation of any business, or from the failure of such a separation to qualify for any intended tax-free treatment; and (38) other risks and uncertainties described from time to time in MetLife, Inc. s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
  MetLife, Inc. does not undertake any obligation to publicly correct or update any forward-looking statement if MetLife, Inc. later becomes aware that such statement is not likely to be achieved. Please consult any further disclosures MetLife, Inc. makes on related subjects in reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    
   
  Business 
   MetLife  and the  Company  refer to MetLife, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1999, its subsidiaries and affiliates. MetLife is a global provider of life insurance, annuities, employee benefits and asset management. In anticipation of the Company s plan to separate a substantial portion of its former Retail segment, as well as certain portions of its former Corporate Benefit Funding segment and Corporate   Other (the  Separation ), in the third quarter of 2016, MetLife reorganized its businesses into   six   segments: U.S.; Asia; Latin America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa ( EMEA  MetLife Holdings; and Brighthouse Financial. See   Note 2   for further information on the reorganization of the Company s segments in the third quarter of 2016, which was applied retrospectively. 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported on the interim condensed consolidated financial statements. In applying these policies and estimates, management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to the Company s business and operations. Actual results could differ from estimates. 
  Consolidation 
  The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries, as well as partnerships and joint ventures in which the Company has control, and variable interest entities ( VIEs ) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 
  Prior to January 1, 2016, certain international subsidiaries had a fiscal year cutoff of November 30th. Accordingly, the Company s interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the assets and liabilities of such subsidiaries as of November 30, 2015 and the operating results of such subsidiaries for the three months and nine months ended August 31, 2015. Effective January 1, 2016, the Company converted its Japan operations to calendar year-end reporting. The elimination of a one-month reporting lag of a subsidiary is considered a change in accounting principle and requires retrospective application. While the Company believes that eliminating the lag in the reporting of its Japan operations was preferable in order to consistently reflect events, economic conditions and global trends in the financial statements, the Company determined that it was impracticable to apply the effects of the lag elimination to financial reporting periods prior to January 1, 2015. The effect of not retroactively applying this change in accounting, however, was not material to the 2015 or 2016 consolidated financial statements. Therefore, the Company reported the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle in net income for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and did not retrospectively apply the effects of this change to prior periods. See   Note 2  . 
  The Company uses the equity method of accounting for equity securities when it has significant influence or at least 20% interest and for real estate joint ventures and other limited partnership interests ( investees ) when it has more than a minor ownership interest or more than a minor influence over the investee s operations, but does not have a controlling financial interest. The Company generally recognizes its share of the investee s earnings on a three-month lag in instances where the investee s financial information is not sufficiently timely or when the investee s reporting period differs from the Company s reporting period. The Company uses the cost method of accounting for investments in which it has virtually no influence over the investee s operations. 
  Reclassifications 
  Certain amounts in the prior year periods  interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related footnotes thereto have been reclassified to conform with the 2016 presentation as discussed throughout the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

  1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and reflect all adjustments (including normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented in conformity with GAAP. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of full year performance. The   December 31, 2015   consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited consolidated financial statements included in MetLife, Inc. s Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (the  2015 Annual Report ), which include all disclosures required by GAAP. Therefore, these interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the   2015   Annual Report. 
  Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncement 
  Effective January 1, 2016, the Company retrospectively adopted new guidance relating to the consolidation of certain entities. The objective of the new standard is to improve targeted areas of the consolidation guidance and to reduce the number of consolidation models. The new consolidation standard provides guidance on how a reporting entity (i) evaluates whether the entity should consolidate limited partnerships and similar entities, (ii) assesses whether the fees paid to a decisionmaker or service provider are variable interests in a VIE, and (iii) assesses the variable interests in a VIE held by related parties of the reporting entity. The new guidance also eliminates the VIE consolidation model based on majority exposure to variability that applied to certain investment companies and similar entities. The adoption of the new guidance did not impact which entities are consolidated by the Company. The consolidated VIE assets and liabilities and unconsolidated VIE carrying amounts and maximum exposure to loss as of September 30, 2016, disclosed in   Note 7  , reflect the application of the new guidance. 
  Future Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements 
  In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued new guidance on consolidation evaluation for entities under common control (Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-17,     Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control  ). The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years, and should be applied on a retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance does not change the characteristics of a primary beneficiary under current GAAP. It changes how a reporting entity evaluates whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE by changing how a reporting entity that is a single decisionmaker of a VIE handles indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In October 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on tax accounting for intra-entity transfers of assets (ASU 2016  -  16,     Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory  ). The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years, and should be applied on a modified retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted in the first interim or annual reporting period. Current guidance prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party. The new guidance requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. Also, the guidance eliminates the exception for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on cash flow statement presentation (ASU 2016-15,     Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ). The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years, and should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. This ASU addresses diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on measurement of credit losses on financial instruments (ASU 2016-13,     Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  )  . The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. This ASU replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology with one that reflects expected credit losses. The measurement of expected credit losses should be based on historical loss information, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The guidance also requires enhanced disclosures. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.

  1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

In March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on stock compensation (ASU 2016-09,     Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting  . The new guidance is effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and requires either a modified retrospective, a retrospective or a prospective transition approach depending upon the type of change. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. The new guidance changes several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (i) income tax consequences when awards vest or are settled; (ii) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities due to statutory tax withholding requirements; and (iii) classification on the statement of cash flows. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on leasing transactions (ASU 2016-02,     Leases - Topic 842  ). The new guidance is effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and requires a modified retrospective transition approach which includes a number of optional practical expedients. Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Consistent with current guidance, leases would be classified as finance or operating leases. However, unlike current guidance, the new guidance will require both types of leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. Lessor accounting will remain largely unchanged from current guidance except for certain targeted changes. The new guidance will also require new qualitative and quantitative disclosures. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued new guidance (ASU 2016-01,     Financial Instruments-Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities)     on the recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for the instrument-specific credit risk provision. The new guidance changes the current accounting guidance related to (i) the classification and measurement of certain equity investments, (ii) the presentation of changes in the fair value of financial liabilities measured under the fair value option ( FVO ) that are due to instrument-specific credit risk, and (iii) certain disclosures associated with the fair value of financial instruments. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In May 2015, the FASB issued new guidance on short-duration insurance contracts (ASU 2015-09,     Financial Services - Insurance (Topic 944): Disclosures about Short-Duration Contracts  ). The amendments in this new guidance are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The new guidance should be applied retrospectively by providing comparative disclosures for each period presented, except for those requirements that apply only to the current period. The new guidance requires insurance entities to provide users of financial statements with more transparent information about initial claim estimates and subsequent adjustments to these estimates, including information on: (i) reconciling from the claim development table to the balance sheet liability, (ii) methodologies and judgments in estimating claims, and (iii) the timing, and frequency of claims. The adoption will not have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements other than expanded disclosures in     Note 4  . 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard (ASU 2014-09,     Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ), effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those years and should be applied retrospectively. In August 2015, the FASB amended the guidance to defer the effective date by one year, effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The new guidance will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP; however, it will not impact the accounting for insurance contracts, leases, financial instruments and guarantees. For those contracts that are impacted by the new guidance, the guidance will require an entity to recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled, in exchange for those goods or services. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
   
  2. Segment Information    
   
  In anticipation of the Separation, in the third quarter of 2016, MetLife reorganized its businesses into     six     segments: U.S.; Asia; Latin America; EMEA; MetLife Holdings; and Brighthouse Financial.   In addition, the Company reports certain of its results of operations in Corporate   Other. These changes were applied retrospectively and did not have an impact on total consolidated net income (loss) or operating earnings in the prior periods.

  2. Segment Information (continued) 

On January 12, 2016, MetLife, Inc. announced its plan to pursue the Separation. Additionally, on July 21, 2016, MetLife, Inc. announced that following the Separation, the separated business will be rebranded as  Brighthouse Financial.  On October 5, 2016, Brighthouse Financial, Inc., a subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. ( Brighthouse ), filed a registration statement on Form 10 (the  Form 10 ) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). The information statement filed as an exhibit to the Form 10, disclosed that the Company intends to include MetLife Insurance Company USA ( MetLife USA ), New England Life Insurance Company ( NELICO ), First MetLife Investors Insurance Company ( FMLI ), MetLife Advisers, LLC and certain captive reinsurance companies in the proposed separated business and distribute at least 80.1% of the shares of Brighthouse s common stock on a     pro rata     basis to the holders of MetLife, Inc. common stock. 
   The ultimate form and timing of the Separation will be influenced by a number of factors, including regulatory considerations and economic conditions. MetLife continues to evaluate and pursue structural alternatives for the proposed Separation. The Separation remains subject to certain conditions, including among others, obtaining final approval from the MetLife, Inc. Board of Directors, receipt of a favorable ruling from the Internal Revenue Service and an opinion from MetLife s tax advisor regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters, and an SEC declaration of the effectiveness of the Form 10. 
  This re-segmentation resulted in a   $296 million  , net of income tax, charge to earnings in the current period, all in the Brighthouse Financial segment, driven by the segment s variable and universal life products. This charge is the direct result of the Company, beginning in the third quarter, no longer being able to aggregate, for loss recognition testing, the variable and universal life products of Brighthouse Financial with the variable and universal life products remaining with MetLife Holdings. Of this amount, the Company recorded   $254 million  , net of income tax, as a one-time charge, which was mostly recognized as a write-off of deferred policy acquisition costs ( DAC ), with the remaining   $42 million  , net of income tax, recognized as an increase in insurance-related liabilities. 
  U.S. 
  The U.S. segment offers a broad range of protection products and services aimed at serving the financial needs of customers throughout their lives. These products are sold to corporations and their respective employees, other institutions and their respective members, as well as individuals. The U.S. segment is organized into three businesses: Group Benefits, Retirement   Income Solutions and Property   Casualty. 
             
    The Group Benefits business offers insurance products and services which include life, dental, group short- and long-term disability, individual disability, accidental death and dismemberment, critical illness, vision and accident   health coverages, as well as prepaid legal plans. This business also sells administrative services-only arrangements to some employers.  
                
    The Retirement   Income Solutions business offers a broad range of annuity and investment products, including guaranteed interest contracts and other stable value products, income annuities and separate account contracts for the investment management of defined benefit and defined contribution plan assets. This business also includes structured settlements and certain products to fund postretirement benefits and company-, bank- or trust-owned life insurance used to finance nonqualified benefit programs for executives.  
                
    The Property   Casualty business offers personal and commercial lines property and casualty insurance, including private passenger automobile, homeowners  and personal excess liability insurance. In addition, Property   Casualty offers small business owners property, liability and business interruption insurance. 
     Asia 
  The Asia segment offers a broad range of products to both individuals and corporations, as well as other institutions and their respective employees, which include whole life, term life, variable life, universal life, accident   health insurance, fixed and variable annuities, credit insurance and endowment products.

EMEA 
  The EMEA segment offers a broad range of products to both individuals and corporations, as well as other institutions and their respective employees, which include life insurance, accident   health insurance, credit insurance, annuities, endowment and retirement   savings products. 
  MetLife Holdings 
  The MetLife Holdings segment consists of operations relating to products and businesses no longer actively marketed by the Company in the U.S. These products and businesses include variable life, universal life, term life, whole life, variable annuities, fixed annuities and index-linked annuities. The MetLife Holdings segment also includes the Company s discontinued long-term care businesses and the assumed reinsurance of certain variable annuity products from the Company s former operating joint venture in Japan. 
  Brighthouse Financial 
  The Brighthouse Financial segment offers a broad range of products and services which include variable annuities, fixed annuities, index-linked annuities, income annuities, term life, whole life, universal life and variable life, as well as certain run-off businesses. These products and services, which exclude the run-off businesses, are actively marketed through various third party retail distribution channels in the U.S. 
  Corporate   Other 
  Corporate   Other contains the excess capital, as well as certain charges and activities, not allocated to the segments, including external integration costs, internal resource costs for associates committed to acquisitions, enterprise-wide strategic initiative restructuring charges and various start-up businesses (including expatriate benefits insurance and the investment management business through which the Company offers fee-based investment management services to institutional clients, as well as the direct to consumer portion of the U.S. Direct business). Additionally, Corporate   Other includes interest expense related to the majority of the Company s outstanding debt and expenses associated with certain legal proceedings and income tax audit issues. Corporate   Other also includes the elimination of intersegment amounts, which generally relate to affiliated reinsurance and intersegment loans, which bear interest rates commensurate with related borrowings. 
  Financial Measures and Segment Accounting Policies 
  Operating earnings is used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, operating earnings is also the Company s GAAP measure of segment performance and is reported below. Operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for net income (loss). The Company believes the presentation of operating earnings as the Company measures it for management purposes enhances the understanding of its performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings allows analysis of the Company s performance relative to the Company s business plan and facilitates comparisons to industry results. 
  Operating earnings is defined as operating revenues less operating expenses, both net of income tax. 
  The financial measures of operating revenues and operating expenses focus on the Company s primary businesses principally by excluding the impact of market volatility, which could distort trends, and revenues and costs related to non-core products and divested businesses and certain entities required to be consolidated under GAAP. Also, these measures exclude results of discontinued operations and other businesses that have been or will be sold or exited by MetLife and are referred to as divested businesses. In addition, for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , operating revenues and operating expenses exclude the financial impact of converting the Company s Japan operations to calendar year-end reporting without retrospective application of this change to prior periods and is referred to as lag elimination. Operating revenues also excludes net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses). Operating expenses also excludes goodwill impairments.

The following additional adjustments are made to revenues, in the line items indicated, in calculating operating revenues: 
             
    Universal life and investment-type product policy fees excludes the amortization of unearned revenue related to net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses) and certain variable annuity guaranteed minimum income benefits ( GMIBs ) fees ( GMIB Fees  
                
    Net investment income: (i) includes investment hedge adjustments which represent earned income on derivatives and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of investments or that are used to replicate certain investments, but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, (ii) excludes post-tax operating earnings adjustments relating to insurance joint ventures accounted for under the equity method, (iii) excludes certain amounts related to contractholder-directed unit-linked investments and (iv) excludes certain amounts related to securitization entities that are VIEs consolidated under GAAP; and 
                
    Other revenues are adjusted for settlements of foreign currency earnings hedges. 
     The following additional adjustments are made to expenses, in the line items indicated, in calculating operating expenses: 
             
    Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends excludes: (i) changes in the policyholder dividend obligation related to net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses), (ii) inflation-indexed benefit adjustments associated with contracts backed by inflation-indexed investments and amounts associated with periodic crediting rate adjustments based on the total return of a contractually referenced pool of assets and other pass through adjustments, (iii) benefits and hedging costs related to GMIBs ( GMIB Costs ) and (iv) market value adjustments associated with surrenders or terminations of contracts ( Market Value Adjustments  
                
    Interest credited to policyholder account balances includes adjustments for earned income on derivatives and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of policyholder account balances but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and excludes amounts related to net investment income earned on contractholder-directed unit-linked investments; 
                
    Amortization of DAC and value of business acquired ( VOBA ) excludes amounts related to: (i) net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses), (ii) GMIB Fees and GMIB Costs and (iii) Market Value Adjustments; 
                
    Amortization of negative VOBA excludes amounts related to Market Value Adjustments; 
                
    Interest expense on debt excludes certain amounts related to securitization entities that are VIEs consolidated under GAAP; and 
                
    Other expenses excludes costs related to: (i) noncontrolling interests, (ii) implementation of new insurance regulatory requirements, and (iii) acquisition, integration and other costs. 
     Operating earnings also excludes the recognition of certain contingent assets and liabilities that could not be recognized at acquisition or adjusted for during the measurement period under GAAP business combination accounting guidance.  
  The tax impact of the adjustments mentioned above are calculated net of the U.S. or foreign statutory tax rate, which could differ from the Company s effective tax rate. Additionally, the provision for income tax (expense) benefit also includes the impact related to the timing of certain tax credits, as well as certain tax reforms 
  Set forth in the tables below is certain financial information with respect to the Company s segments, as well as Corporate   Other, for the     three months     and     nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The segment accounting policies are the same as those used to prepare the Company s consolidated financial statements, except for operating earnings adjustments as defined above. In addition, segment accounting policies include the method of capital allocation described below, with the exception of the Brighthouse Financial segment,     for which equity is reflective of the historical equity of the legal entities which comprise Brighthouse and related companies, which will be eliminated upon Separation. The Brighthouse Financial segment equity is not indicative of Brighthouse and related companies  equity on a combined standalone basis.  
  Economic capital is an internally developed risk capital model, the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed. The economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in the Company s business.

  Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)   (continued) 
  2. Segment Information (continued) 

The Company s economic capital model, coupled with considerations of local capital requirements, aligns segment allocated equity with emerging standards and consistent risk principles. The model applies statistics-based risk evaluation principles to the material risks to which the Company is exposed. These consistent risk principles include calibrating required economic capital shock factors to a specific confidence level and time horizon while applying an industry standard method for the inclusion of diversification benefits among risk types.     The Company s management is responsible for the ongoing production and enhancement of the economic capital model and reviews its approach periodically to ensure that it remains consistent with emerging industry practice standards.  
  Segment net investment income, with the exception of the Brighthouse Financial segment, is credited or charged based on the level of allocated equity; however, changes in allocated equity do not impact the Company s consolidated net investment income, net income (loss) or operating earnings. As noted above, the Brighthouse Financial segment s net investment income represents that of the legal entities which comprise Brighthouse and related companies on a historical basis, however, may not be indicative of that on a combined standalone basis.  
  Net investment income is based upon the actual results of each segment s specifically identifiable investment portfolios adjusted for allocated equity. Other costs are allocated to each of the segments based upon: (i) a review of the nature of such costs; (ii) time studies analyzing the amount of employee compensation costs incurred by each segment; and (iii) cost estimates included in the Company s product pricing.

  In July 2016, MetLife, Inc. completed the sale to Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company ( MassMutual ) of its U.S. retail advisor force and certain assets associated with the MetLife Premier Client Group, including all of the issued and outstanding shares of MetLife s affiliated broker-dealer, MetLife Securities, Inc. ( MSI ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. (collectively, the  U.S. Retail Advisor Force Divestiture ) for   $291 million  . MassMutual assumed all of the liabilities related to such assets that arise or occur after the closing of the sale. The Company recorded a gain of   $103 million   (  $58 million  , net of income tax), in net investment gains (losses) for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016. See Notes   9   and   13   for discussion of certain charges related to the sale.

Guarantees 
  As discussed in Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the   2015   Annual Report, the Company issues directly and assumes through reinsurance variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits. Guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits ( GMABs ) and the portions of both non-life-contingent guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits ( GMWBs ) and the GMIBs that do not require annuitization are accounted for as embedded derivatives in policyholder account balances and are further discussed in   Note 8  .

     Table of Contents  
  MetLife, Inc. 
  Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)   (continued) 
  4. Insurance (continued) 

The Company also issues other annuity contracts that apply a lower rate on funds deposited if the contractholder elects to surrender the contract for cash and a higher rate if the contractholder elects to annuitize. These guarantees include benefits that are payable in the event of death, maturity or at annuitization. Certain other annuity contracts contain guaranteed annuitization benefits that may be above what would be provided by the current account value of the contract. Additionally, the Company issues universal and variable life contracts where the Company contractually guarantees to the contractholder a secondary guarantee or a guaranteed paid-up benefit. 
  Information regarding the Company s guarantee exposure, which includes direct and assumed business, but excludes offsets from hedging or ceded reinsurance, if any, was as follows at: 

__________________ 
           (1) 
    The Company s annuity and life contracts with guarantees may offer more than one type of guarantee in each contract. Therefore, the amounts listed above may not be mutually exclusive. 
              (2) 
    Includes amounts, which are not reported on the consolidated balance sheets, from assumed reinsurance of certain variable annuity products from the Company s former operating joint venture in Japan. 
              (3) 
    Includes the contractholder s investments in the general account and separate account, if applicable. 
              (4) 
    Defined as the death benefit less the total account value, as of the balance sheet date. It represents the amount of the claim that the Company would incur if death claims were filed on all contracts on the balance sheet date and includes any additional contractual claims associated with riders purchased to assist with covering income taxes payable upon death. 
              (5) 
    Defined as the amount (if any) that would be required to be added to the total account value to purchase a lifetime income stream, based on current annuity rates, equal to the minimum amount provided under the guaranteed benefit. This amount represents the Company s potential economic exposure to such guarantees in the event all contractholders were to annuitize on the balance sheet date, even though the contracts contain terms that allow annuitization of the guaranteed amount only after the 10th anniversary of the contract, which not all contractholders have achieved.

These amounts represent the Company s potential economic exposure to such guarantees in the event all contractholders were to annuitize on the balance sheet date. 
              (7) 
    Defined as the guarantee amount less the account value, as of the balance sheet date. It represents the amount of the claim that the Company would incur if death claims were filed on all contracts on the balance sheet date.

6. Closed Block    
   
  On April 7, 2000 (the  Demutualization Date ), Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ( MLIC ) converted from a mutual life insurance company to a stock life insurance company and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. The conversion was pursuant to an order by the New York Superintendent of Insurance approving MLIC s plan of reorganization, as amended (the  Plan of Reorganization ). On the Demutualization Date, MLIC established a closed block for the benefit of holders of certain individual life insurance policies of MLIC. 
  Experience within the closed block, in particular mortality and investment yields, as well as realized and unrealized gains and losses, directly impact the policyholder dividend obligation. Amortization of the closed block DAC, which resides outside of the closed block, is based upon cumulative actual and expected earnings within the closed block. Accordingly, the Company s net income continues to be sensitive to the actual performance of the closed block. 
  Closed block assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are combined on a line-by-line basis with the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses outside the closed block based on the nature of the particular item.

  Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities Available-for-Sale by Sector 
  The following table presents the fixed maturity and equity securities available-for-sale ( AFS ) by sector. Redeemable preferred stock is reported within U.S. corporate and foreign corporate fixed maturity securities and non-redeemable preferred stock is reported within equity securities. Included within fixed maturity securities are structured securities including residential mortgage-backed securities ( RMBS ), asset-backed securities ( ABS ) and commercial mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS ) (collectively,  Structured Securities ). 

__________________ 
           (1) 
    The noncredit loss component of other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) losses for CMBS was in an unrealized gain position of   $1 million   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   due to increases in estimated fair value subsequent to initial recognition of noncredit losses on such securities. See also    Net Unrealized Investment Gains (Losses).  
     The Company held non-income producing fixed maturity securities with an estimated fair value of   $44 million   and   $54 million   with unrealized gains (losses) of   ($5) million   and   $12 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Maturities of Fixed Maturity Securities 
  The amortized cost and estimated fair value of fixed maturity securities, by contractual maturity date, were as follows at   September 30, 2016  :

Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities due to the exercise of call or prepayment options. Fixed maturity securities not due at a single maturity date have been presented in the year of final contractual maturity. Structured Securities are shown separately, as they are not due at a single maturity. 
  Continuous Gross Unrealized Losses for Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities AFS by Sector 
  The following table presents the estimated fair value and gross unrealized losses of fixed maturity and equity securities AFS in an unrealized loss position, aggregated by sector and by length of time that the securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at: 

Evaluation of AFS Securities for OTTI and Evaluating Temporarily Impaired AFS Securities 
  As described more fully in Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the   2015   Annual Report, the Company performs a regular evaluation of all investment classes for impairment, including fixed maturity securities, equity securities and perpetual hybrid securities, in accordance with its impairment policy, in order to evaluate whether such investments are other-than-temporarily impaired. 
  Current Period Evaluation 
  Based on the Company s current evaluation of its AFS securities in an unrealized loss position in accordance with its impairment policy, and the Company s current intentions and assessments (as applicable to the type of security) about holding, selling and any requirements to sell these securities, the Company concluded that these securities were not other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  . Future OTTI will depend primarily on economic fundamentals, issuer performance (including changes in the present value of future cash flows expected to be collected), changes in credit ratings, collateral valuation, interest rates and credit spreads. If economic fundamentals deteriorate or if there are adverse changes in the above factors, OTTI may be incurred in upcoming periods. 
  Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities decreased     $2.6 billion     during the     nine months ended     September 30, 2016     to     $2.8 billion  . The decrease in gross unrealized losses for the     nine months ended     September 30, 2016     was primarily attributable to a decrease in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, narrowing credit spreads. 
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   $321 million   of the total   $2.8 billion   of gross unrealized losses were from   74   fixed maturity securities with an unrealized loss position of   20%   or more of amortized cost for six months or greater.

Investment Grade Fixed Maturity Securities 
  Of the   $321 million   of gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities with an unrealized loss of   20%   or more of amortized cost for six months or greater,   $199 million  , or   62%  , were related to gross unrealized losses on   35   investment grade fixed maturity securities. Unrealized losses on investment grade fixed maturity securities are principally related to widening credit spreads and, with respect to fixed-rate fixed maturity securities, rising interest rates since purchase. 
  Below Investment Grade Fixed Maturity Securities 
  Of the   $321 million   of gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities with an unrealized loss of   20%   or more of amortized cost for six months or greater,   $122 million  , or   38%  , were related to gross unrealized losses on   39   below investment grade fixed maturity securities. Unrealized losses on below investment grade fixed maturity securities are principally related to U.S. and foreign corporate securities (primarily industrial securities) and are the result of significantly wider credit spreads resulting from higher risk premiums since purchase, largely due to economic and market uncertainties including concerns over lower oil prices in the energy sector. Management evaluates U.S. and foreign corporate securities based on factors such as expected cash flows and the financial condition and near-term and long-term prospects of the issuers. 
  Equity Securities 
  Gross unrealized losses on equity securities decreased   $97 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   to   $61 million  . Of the   $61 million  ,   $38 million   were from   six   securities with gross unrealized losses of   20%   or more of cost for 12 months or greater. Of the   $38 million  ,   61%   were rated A or better, and all were from financial services industry investment grade non-redeemable preferred stock.

           (1) 
    In connection with an acquisition in 2010, certain impaired commercial mortgage loans were acquired and accordingly, were not originated by the Company. Such commercial mortgage loans have been accounted for as purchased credit impaired ( PCI ) commercial mortgage loans. As explained in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2015 Annual Report, decreases in cash flows expected to be collected on PCI commercial mortgage loans can result in provisions for losses on mortgage loan. For the nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , in connection with the maturity of an acquired PCI commercial mortgage loan, an increase to the commercial mortgage loan valuation allowance of     $143 million     was recorded and charged-off upon maturity. The Company will recover a substantial portion of the loss on the loan incurred through an indemnification agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition in 2010  .

The cash collateral liability by loaned security type and remaining tenor of the agreements were as follows at: 

__________________ 
           (1) 
    The related loaned security could be returned to the Company on the next business day which would require the Company to immediately return the cash collateral. 
     If the Company is required to return significant amounts of cash collateral on short notice and is forced to sell securities to meet the return obligation, it may have difficulty selling such collateral that is invested in securities in a timely manner, be forced to sell securities in a volatile or illiquid market for less than what otherwise would have been realized under normal market conditions, or both. The estimated fair value of the securities on loan related to the cash collateral on open at   September 30, 2016   was   $8.1 billion  , over   99%   of which were U.S. government and agency securities which, if put back to the Company, could be immediately sold to satisfy the cash requirement. 
  The reinvestment portfolio acquired with the cash collateral consisted principally of fixed maturity securities (including U.S. government and agency, agency RMBS, short-term investments, ABS and U.S. corporate securities) with   65%   invested in U.S. government and agency securities, agency RMBS, short-term investments, or held in cash and cash equivalents. If the securities on loan or the reinvestment portfolio become less liquid, the Company has the liquidity resources of most of its general account available to meet any potential cash demands when securities on loan are put back to the Company.  
  Repurchase Agreement Transactions 
  The Company participates in contemporaneous short-term repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements with unaffiliated financial institutions. Under these agreements, the Company lends fixed maturity securities and contemporaneously borrows other fixed maturity securities (e.g., repurchase and reverse repurchase, respectively). The Company obtains cash collateral in an amount greater than or equal to   95%   of the estimated fair value of the securities loaned, and pledges cash collateral in an amount generally equal to   98%   of the estimated fair value of the borrowed securities at the inception of the transaction. The Company monitors the estimated fair value of the securities loaned and borrowed with additional collateral obtained as necessary throughout the duration of the transaction.  
  The Company accounted for these transactions as collateralized borrowing and lending. The amount of fixed maturity securities lent and borrowed, at estimated fair value, was   $316 million   and   $306 million  , respectively, at   September 30, 2016  . There were   no   such transactions outstanding as of   December 31, 2015  . Securities loaned under such transactions may be sold or re-pledged by the transferee. Securities borrowed under such transactions may be re-pledged and are not reflected on the consolidated financial statements. The amount of borrowed securities which were re-pledged was   $114 million  , at estimated fair value, at   September 30, 2016  .

The Company has elected to offset amounts recognized as receivables and payables resulting from these transactions. The gross amounts of the receivables and payables related to these transactions at   September 30, 2016   were both   $300 million  . After the effect of offsetting of   $300 million  , the net amount presented on the consolidated balance sheet at   September 30, 2016   was a liability of less than   $1 million  . Amounts owed to and due from counterparties may be settled in cash or offset, in accordance with the agreements. Cash inflows and outflows for cash settlements are reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows. At   September 30, 2016  , all   $300 million   of payables from repurchase agreements had a remaining tenor of one to six months and were primarily loans of U.S. corporate securities. 
  See Note   8   for information regarding the estimated fair value of the Company s net derivative assets and net derivative liabilities after the application of master netting agreements and collateral. 
  The Company also participates in other short-term repurchase agreements with unaffiliated financial institutions. Under these agreements, the Company lends fixed maturity securities and receives cash as collateral in an amount generally equal to   85%   to   100%   of the estimated fair value of the securities loaned at the inception of the transaction. The associated liability is recorded at the amount of cash received. The Company monitors the estimated fair value of the collateral and the securities loaned throughout the duration of the transaction and additional collateral is obtained as necessary. Securities loaned under such transactions may be sold or re-pledged by the transferee. 
  Elements of the other short-term repurchase agreements are presented below at:

  Variable Interest Entities 
  The Company is involved with certain legal entities that are VIEs. In certain instances, the Company holds both the power to direct the most significant activities of the entity, as well as an economic interest in the entity and, as such, is deemed to be the primary beneficiary or consolidator of the entity. The determination of the VIE s primary beneficiary requires an evaluation of the contractual and implied rights and obligations associated with each party s relationship with or involvement in the entity. 
  Consolidated VIEs 
  Creditors or beneficial interest holders of VIEs where the Company is the pr  imary beneficiary have no recourse to the general credit of the Company, as the Company s obligation to the VIEs is limited to the amount of its committed investment. 
  The following table presents the total assets and total liabilities re  lating to VIEs for which the Company has concluded that it is the primary beneficiary and which are consolidated at:

              (2) 
    Following a change in the foreign investment law in India, the Company no longer consolidated its India operating joint venture, effective January 1, 2016. Assets of the operating joint venture are primarily fixed maturity securities and separate account assets. Liabilities of the operating joint venture are primarily future policy benefits, other policy-related balances and separate account liabilities. 
              (3) 
    The Company consolidates entities that are structured as CMBS and as collateralized debt obligations. The assets of these entities can only be used to settle their respective liabilities, and under no circumstances is the Company liable for any principal or interest shortfalls should any arise. The Company s exposure was limited to that of its remaining investment in these entities of   $98 million   and   $105 million   at estimated fair value at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
              (4) 
    Other investments is primarily comprised of other invested assets and other limited partnership interests.

Unconsolidated VIEs 
  The carrying amount and maximum exposure to loss relating to VIEs in which the Company holds a significant variable interest but is not the primary beneficiary and which have not been consolidated were as follows at: 

__________________ 
           (1) 
    The maximum exposure to loss relating to fixed maturity securities AFS, FVO and trading securities and equity securities AFS is equal to their carrying amounts or the carrying amounts of retained interests. The maximum exposure to loss relating to other limited partnership interests, mortgage loans and real estate joint ventures is equal to the carrying amounts plus any unfunded commitments. For certain of its investments in other invested assets, the Company s return is in the form of income tax credits which are guaranteed by creditworthy third parties. For such investments, the maximum exposure to loss is equal to the carrying amounts plus any unfunded commitments, reduced by income tax credits guaranteed by third parties of   $151 million   and   $179 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Such a maximum loss would be expected to occur only upon bankruptcy of the issuer or investee. 
              (2) 
    For these variable interests, the Company s involvement is limited to that of a passive investor in mortgage-backed or asset-backed securities issued by trusts that do not have substantial equity. 
              (3) 
    Other is comprised of mortgage loans, non-redeemable preferred stock and a loan receivable. 
     As described in Note   15  , the Company makes commitments to fund partnership investments in the normal course of business. Excluding these commitments, the Company did not provide financial or other support to investees designated as VIEs during both the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

Net Investment Income 
  The components of net investment income were as follows: 

__________________ 
           (1) 
    Changes in estimated fair value subsequent to purchase for securities still held as of the end of the respective periods included in net investment income were principally from FVO contractholder-directed unit-linked investments and, to a much lesser extent, Actively traded and FVO general account securities, and were   $407 million   and   $283 million   for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and   ($872) million   and   ($645) million   for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  
     See    Variable Interest Entities  for discussion of CSEs. 
  FVO and trading securities are primarily comprised of securities for which the FVO has been elected ( FVO securities ). FVO securities include certain fixed maturity and equity securities held-for-investment by the general account to support asset and liability management strategies for certain insurance products and investments in certain separate accounts. FVO securities are primarily comprised of contractholder-directed investments supporting unit-linked variable annuity type liabilities which do not qualify for presentation as separate account summary total assets and liabilities. The investment returns on these investments inure to the contractholders and are offset by a corresponding change in policyholder account balances through interest credited to policyholder account balances. FVO securities also include securities held by CSEs. The Company previously maintained a trading securities portfolio, principally invested in fixed maturity securities, to support investment strategies that involved the active and frequent purchase and sale of actively traded securities and the execution of short sale agreements. In June 2016, the Company commenced a reinvestment of this portfolio into other asset classes and, at September 30, 2016, the Company   no   longer held any actively traded securities.

  Accounting for Derivatives 
  Freestanding Derivatives 
  Freestanding derivatives are carried on the Company s balance sheet either as assets within other invested assets or as liabilities within other liabilities at estimated fair value. The Company does not offset the estimated fair value amounts recognized for derivatives executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting agreement. 
  Accruals on derivatives are generally recorded in accrued investment income or within other liabilities. However, accruals that are not scheduled to settle within one year are included with the derivatives carrying value in other invested assets or other liabilities. 
  If a derivative is not designated as an accounting hedge or its use in managing risk does not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in the estimated fair value of the derivative are reported in net derivative gains (losses) except as follows:

Hedge Accounting 
  To qualify for hedge accounting, at the inception of the hedging relationship, the Company formally documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction, as well as its designation of the hedge. Hedge designation and financial statement presentation of changes in estimated fair value of the hedging derivatives are as follows: 
             
    Fair value hedge   (a hedge of the estimated fair value of a recognized asset or liability) - in net derivative gains (losses), consistent with the change in estimated fair value of the hedged item attributable to the designated risk being hedged. 
                
    Cash flow hedge   (a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability) - effectiveness in OCI (deferred gains or losses on the derivative are reclassified into the statement of operations when the Company s earnings are affected by the variability in cash flows of the hedged item); ineffectiveness in net derivative gains (losses). 
                
    Net investment in a foreign operation hedge   - effectiveness in OCI, consistent with the translation adjustment for the hedged net investment in the foreign operation; ineffectiveness in net derivative gains (losses). 
     The changes in estimated fair values of the hedging derivatives are exclusive of any accruals that are separately reported on the statement of operations within interest income or interest expense to match the location of the hedged item. Accruals on derivatives in net investment hedges are recognized in OCI. 
  In its hedge documentation, the Company sets forth how the hedging instrument is expected to hedge the designated risks related to the hedged item and sets forth the method that will be used to retrospectively and prospectively assess the hedging instrument s effectiveness and the method that will be used to measure ineffectiveness. A derivative designated as a hedging instrument must be assessed as being highly effective in offsetting the designated risk of the hedged item. Hedge effectiveness is formally assessed at inception and at least quarterly throughout the life of the designated hedging relationship. Assessments of hedge effectiveness and measurements of ineffectiveness are also subject to interpretation and estimation and different interpretations or estimates may have a material effect on the amount reported in net income. 
  The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when: (i) it is determined that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the estimated fair value or cash flows of a hedged item; (ii) the derivative expires, is sold, terminated, or exercised; (iii) it is no longer probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur; or (iv) the derivative is de-designated as a hedging instrument. 
  When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined that the derivative is not highly effective in offsetting changes in the estimated fair value or cash flows of a hedged item, the derivative continues to be carried on the balance sheet at its estimated fair value, with changes in estimated fair value recognized in net derivative gains (losses). The carrying value of the hedged recognized asset or liability under a fair value hedge is no longer adjusted for changes in its estimated fair value due to the hedged risk, and the cumulative adjustment to its carrying value is amortized into income over the remaining life of the hedged item. Provided the hedged forecasted transaction is still probable of occurrence, the changes in estimated fair value of derivatives recorded in OCI related to discontinued cash flow hedges are released into the statement of operations when the Company s earnings are affected by the variability in cash flows of the hedged item. 
  When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transactions will occur on the anticipated date or within two months of that date, the derivative continues to be carried on the balance sheet at its estimated fair value, with changes in estimated fair value recognized currently in net derivative gains (losses). Deferred gains and losses of a derivative recorded in OCI pursuant to the discontinued cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction that is no longer probable are recognized immediately in net derivative gains (losses). 
  In all other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued, the derivative is carried at its estimated fair value on the balance sheet, with changes in its estimated fair value recognized in the current period as net derivative gains (losses).

Embedded Derivatives 
  The Company sells variable annuities and issues certain insurance products and investment contracts and is a party to certain reinsurance agreements that have embedded derivatives. The Company assesses each identified embedded derivative to determine whether it is required to be bifurcated. The embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host contract and accounted for as a freestanding derivative if: 
             
    the combined instrument is not accounted for in its entirety at estimated fair value with changes in estimated fair value recorded in earnings; 
                
    the terms of the embedded derivative are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract; and 
                
    a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would qualify as a derivative instrument. 
     Such embedded derivatives are carried on the balance sheet at estimated fair value with the host contract and changes in their estimated fair value are generally reported in net derivative gains (losses), except for those in policyholder benefits and claims related to ceded reinsurance of GMIB. If the Company is unable to properly identify and measure an embedded derivative for separation from its host contract, the entire contract is carried on the balance sheet at estimated fair value, with changes in estimated fair value recognized in the current period in net investment gains (losses) or net investment income. Additionally, the Company may elect to carry an entire contract on the balance sheet at estimated fair value, with changes in estimated fair value recognized in the current period in net investment gains (losses) or net investment income if that contract contains an embedded derivative that requires bifurcation. At inception, the Company attributes to the embedded derivative a portion of the projected future guarantee fees to be collected from the policyholder equal to the present value of projected future guaranteed benefits. Any additional fees represent  excess  fees and are reported in universal life and investment-type product policy fees. 
  See Note   9   for information about the fair value hierarchy for derivatives. 
   
  Derivative Strategies 
  The Company is exposed to various risks relating to its ongoing business operations, including interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, credit and equity market. The Company uses a variety of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivatives. 
  Derivatives are financial instruments with values derived from interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and/or other financial indices. Derivatives may be exchange-traded or contracted in the over-the-counter ( OTC ) market. Certain of the Company s OTC derivatives are cleared and settled through central clearing counterparties ( OTC-cleared ), while others are bilateral contracts between two counterparties ( OTC-bilateral ). The types of derivatives the Company uses include swaps, forwards, futures and option contracts. To a lesser extent, the Company uses credit default swaps and structured interest rate swaps to synthetically replicate investment risks and returns which are not readily available in the cash market. 
  Interest Rate Derivatives 
  The Company uses a variety of interest rate derivatives to reduce its exposure to changes in interest rates, including interest rate swaps, interest rate total return swaps, caps, floors, swaptions, futures and forwards. 
  Interest rate swaps are used by the Company primarily to reduce market risks from changes in interest rates and to alter interest rate exposure arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities (duration mismatches). In an interest rate swap, the Company agrees with another party to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts as calculated by reference to an agreed notional amount. The Company utilizes interest rate swaps in fair value, cash flow and nonqualifying hedging relationships. 
  The Company uses structured interest rate swaps to synthetically create investments that are either more expensive to acquire or otherwise unavailable in the cash markets. These transactions are a combination of a derivative and a cash instrument such as a U.S. government and agency, or other fixed maturity security. Structured interest rate swaps are included in interest rate swaps and are not designated as hedging instruments.

Interest rate total return swaps are swaps whereby the Company agrees with another party to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between the economic risk and reward of an asset or a market index and the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ), calculated by reference to an agreed notional amount. No cash is exchanged at the outset of the contract. Cash is paid and received over the life of the contract based on the terms of the swap. These transactions are entered into pursuant to master agreements that provide for a single net payment to be made by the counterparty at each due date. Interest rate total return swaps are used by the Company to reduce market risks from changes in interest rates and to alter interest rate exposure arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities (duration mismatches). The Company utilizes interest rate total return swaps in nonqualifying hedging relationships. 
  The Company purchases interest rate caps and floors primarily to protect its floating rate liabilities against rises in interest rates above a specified level, and against interest rate exposure arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities, as well as to protect its minimum rate guarantee liabilities against declines in interest rates below a specified level, respectively. In certain instances, the Company locks in the economic impact of existing purchased caps and floors by entering into offsetting written caps and floors. The Company utilizes interest rate caps and floors in nonqualifying hedging relationships. 
  In exchange-traded interest rate (Treasury and swap) futures transactions, the Company agrees to purchase or sell a specified number of contracts, the value of which is determined by the different classes of interest rate securities, and to post variation margin on a daily basis in an amount equal to the difference in the daily market values of those contracts. The Company enters into exchange-traded futures with regulated futures commission merchants that are members of the exchange. Exchange-traded interest rate (Treasury and swap) futures are used primarily to hedge mismatches between the duration of assets in a portfolio and the duration of liabilities supported by those assets, to hedge against changes in value of securities the Company owns or anticipates acquiring, to hedge against changes in interest rates on anticipated liability issuances by replicating Treasury or swap curve performance, and to hedge minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products offered by the Company. The Company utilizes exchange-traded interest rate futures in nonqualifying hedging relationships. 
  Swaptions are used by the Company to hedge interest rate risk associated with the Company s long-term liabilities and invested assets. A swaption is an option to enter into a swap with a forward starting effective date. In certain instances, the Company locks in the economic impact of existing purchased swaptions by entering into offsetting written swaptions. The Company pays a premium for purchased swaptions and receives a premium for written swaptions. The Company utilizes swaptions in nonqualifying hedging relationships. Swaptions are included in interest rate options. 
  The Company enters into interest rate forwards to buy and sell securities. The price is agreed upon at the time of the contract and payment for such a contract is made at a specified future date. The Company utilizes interest rate forwards in cash flow and nonqualifying hedging relationships. 
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Derivatives 
  The Company uses foreign currency exchange rate derivatives, including foreign currency swaps, foreign currency forwards, currency options and exchange-traded currency futures, to reduce the risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates associated with its assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The Company also uses foreign currency derivatives to hedge the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of its net investments in foreign operations. 
  In a foreign currency swap transaction, the Company agrees with another party to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between one currency and another at a fixed exchange rate, generally set at inception, calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional amount. The notional amount of each currency is exchanged at the inception and termination of the currency swap by each party. The Company utilizes foreign currency swaps in fair value, cash flow and nonqualifying hedging relationships. 
  In a foreign currency forward transaction, the Company agrees with another party to deliver a specified amount of an identified currency at a specified future date. The price is agreed upon at the time of the contract and payment for such a contract is made at the specified future date. The Company utilizes foreign currency forwards in fair value, net investment in foreign operations and nonqualifying hedging relationships.

The Company enters into currency options that give it the right, but not the obligation, to sell the foreign currency amount in exchange for a functional currency amount within a limited time at a contracted price. The contracts may also be net settled in cash, based on differentials in the foreign currency exchange rate and the strike price. The Company uses currency options to hedge against the foreign currency exposure inherent in certain of its variable annuity products. The Company also uses currency options as an economic hedge of foreign currency exposure related to the Company s international subsidiaries. The Company utilizes currency options in net investment in foreign operations and nonqualifying hedging relationships. 
  To a lesser extent, the Company uses exchange-traded currency futures to hedge currency mismatches between assets and liabilities, and to hedge minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products offered by the Company. The Company utilizes exchange-traded currency futures in nonqualifying hedging relationships. 
  Credit Derivatives 
  The Company enters into purchased credit default swaps to hedge against credit-related changes in the value of its investments. In a credit default swap transaction, the Company agrees with another party to pay, at specified intervals, a premium to hedge credit risk. If a credit event occurs, as defined by the contract, the contract may be cash settled or it may be settled gross by the delivery of par quantities of the referenced investment equal to the specified swap notional amount in exchange for the payment of cash amounts by the counterparty equal to the par value of the investment surrendered. Credit events vary by type of issuer but typically include bankruptcy, failure to pay debt obligations, repudiation, moratorium, involuntary restructuring or governmental intervention. In each case, payout on a credit default swap is triggered only after the Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. ( ISDA ) deems that a credit event has occurred. The Company utilizes credit default swaps in nonqualifying hedging relationships. 
  The Company enters into written credit default swaps to synthetically create credit investments that are either more expensive to acquire or otherwise unavailable in the cash markets. These transactions are a combination of a derivative and one or more cash instruments, such as U.S. government and agency securities, or other fixed maturity securities. These credit default swaps are not designated as hedging instruments. 
  The Company also enters into certain purchased and written credit default swaps held in relation to trading portfolios for the purpose of generating profits on short-term differences in price. These credit default swaps are not designated as hedging instruments. 
  The Company enters into forwards to lock in the price to be paid for forward purchases of certain securities. The price is agreed upon at the time of the contract and payment for the contract is made at a specified future date. When the primary purpose of entering into these transactions is to hedge against the risk of changes in purchase price due to changes in credit spreads, the Company designates these transactions as credit forwards. The Company utilizes credit forwards in cash flow hedging relationships. 
  Equity Derivatives 
  The Company uses a variety of equity derivatives to reduce its exposure to equity market risk, including equity index options, equity variance swaps, exchange-traded equity futures and equity total return swaps. 
  Equity index options are used by the Company primarily to hedge minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products offered by the Company. To hedge against adverse changes in equity indices, the Company enters into contracts to sell the equity index within a limited time at a contracted price. The contracts will be net settled in cash based on differentials in the indices at the time of exercise and the strike price. Certain of these contracts may also contain settlement provisions linked to interest rates. In certain instances, the Company may enter into a combination of transactions to hedge adverse changes in equity indices within a pre-determined range through the purchase and sale of options. The Company utilizes equity index options in nonqualifying hedging relationships. 
  Equity variance swaps are used by the Company primarily to hedge minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products offered by the Company. In an equity variance swap, the Company agrees with another party to exchange amounts in the future, based on changes in equity volatility over a defined period. The Company utilizes equity variance swaps in nonqualifying hedging relationships.

In exchange-traded equity futures transactions, the Company agrees to purchase or sell a specified number of contracts, the value of which is determined by the different classes of equity securities, and to post variation margin on a daily basis in an amount equal to the difference in the daily market values of those contracts. The Company enters into exchange-traded futures with regulated futures commission merchants that are members of the exchange. Exchange-traded equity futures are used primarily to hedge minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products offered by the Company. The Company utilizes exchange-traded equity futures in nonqualifying hedging relationships. 
  In an equity total return swap, the Company agrees with another party to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between the economic risk and reward of an asset or a market index and LIBOR, calculated by reference to an agreed notional amount. No cash is exchanged at the outset of the contract. Cash is paid and received over the life of the contract based on the terms of the swap. The Company uses equity total return swaps to hedge its equity market guarantees in certain of its insurance products. Equity total return swaps can be used as hedges or to synthetically create investments. The Company utilizes equity total return swaps in nonqualifying hedging relationships.

Based on gross notional amounts, a substantial portion of the Company s derivatives was not designated or did not qualify as part of a hedging relationship at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The Company s use of derivatives includes (i) derivatives that serve as macro hedges of the Company s exposure to various risks and that generally do not qualify for hedge accounting due to the criteria required under the portfolio hedging rules; (ii) derivatives that economically hedge insurance liabilities that contain mortality or morbidity risk and that generally do not qualify for hedge accounting because the lack of these risks in the derivatives cannot support an expectation of a highly effective hedging relationship; (iii) derivatives that economically hedge embedded derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting because the changes in estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives are already recorded in net income; and (iv) written credit default swaps that are used to synthetically create credit investments and that do not qualify for hedge accounting because they do not involve a hedging relationship. For these nonqualified derivatives, changes in market factors can lead to the recognition of fair value changes on the statement of operations without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged. 
   
  Net Derivative Gains (Losses) 
  The components of net derivative gains (losses) were as follows:

    Changes in estimated fair value related to economic hedges of variable annuity guarantees included in future policy benefits. 
      
  Fair Value Hedges 
  The Company designates and accounts for the following as fair value hedges when they have met the requirements of fair value hedging: (i) interest rate swaps to convert fixed rate assets and liabilities to floating rate assets and liabilities; (ii) foreign currency swaps to hedge the foreign currency fair value exposure of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities; and (iii) foreign currency forwards to hedge the foreign currency fair value exposure of foreign currency denominated investments.

For the Company s foreign currency forwards, the change in the estimated fair value of the derivative related to the changes in the difference between the spot price and the forward price is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. For all other derivatives, all components of each derivative s gain or loss were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. For the   three months   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   ($6) million   and   ($16) million  , respectively, of the change in estimated fair value of derivatives was excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. For the   three months   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  ,   ($4) million   and   ($9) million  , respectively, of the change in estimated fair value of derivatives was excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.  
   
  Cash Flow Hedges 
  The Company designates and accounts for the following as cash flow hedges when they have met the requirements of cash flow hedging: (i) interest rate swaps to convert floating rate assets and liabilities to fixed rate assets and liabilities; (ii) foreign currency swaps to hedge the foreign currency cash flow exposure of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities; (iii) interest rate forwards and credit forwards to lock in the price to be paid for forward purchases of investments; (iv) interest rate swaps and interest rate forwards to hedge the forecasted purchases of fixed-rate investments; and (v) interest rate swaps and interest rate forwards to hedge forecasted fixed-rate borrowings. 
  In certain instances, the Company discontinued cash flow hedge accounting because the forecasted transactions were no longer probable of occurring. Because certain of the forecasted transactions also were not probable of occurring within two months of the anticipated date, the Company reclassified amounts from AOCI into net derivative gains (losses). These amounts were   $12 million   and   $7 million   for the   three months   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. These amounts were   ($3) million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  . For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the amounts reclassified from AOCI into net derivative gains (losses) were not significant. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the maximum length of time over which the Company was hedging its exposure to variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions did not exceed   six years   and   five years  , respectively. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the balance in AOCI associated with cash flow hedges was   $3.6 billion   and   $2.4 billion  , respectively.

The following table presents the effects of derivatives in cash flow hedging relationships on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) and the consolidated statements of equity: 

All components of e  ach derivative s gain or loss were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. 
  At     September 30, 2016  , the Company expects to reclassify   ($64) million     of deferred net gains (losses) on derivatives in AOCI to earnings within the next 12 months. 
   
  Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations 
  The Company uses foreign currency exchange rate derivatives, which may include foreign currency forwards and currency options, to hedge portions of its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. The Company measures ineffectiveness on these derivatives based upon the change in forward rates. 
  When net investments in foreign operations are sold or substantially liquidated, the amounts in AOCI are reclassified to the statement of operations.

    During both the     three months     and     nine months ended     September 30, 2016     and     2015  , there were     no     sales or substantial liquidations of net investments in foreign operations that would have required the reclassification of gains or losses from AOCI into earnings. 
              (2) 
    There was   no   ineffectiveness recognized for the Company s hedges of net investments in foreign operations. All components of each derivative s gain or loss were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. 
     At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the cumulative foreign currency translation gain (loss) recorded in AOCI related to hedges of net investments in foreign operations was   $347 million   and   $1.1 billion  , respectively.  
   
  Credit Derivatives 
  In connection with synthetically created credit investment transactions and credit default swaps held in relation to the trading portfolio, the Company writes credit default swaps for which it receives a premium to insure credit risk. Such credit derivatives are included within the nonqualifying derivatives and derivatives for purposes other than hedging table. If a credit event occurs, as defined by the contract, the contract may be cash settled or it may be settled gross by the Company paying the counterparty the specified swap notional amount in exchange for the delivery of par quantities of the referenced credit obligation. The Company s maximum amount at risk, assuming the value of all referenced credit obligations is zero, was   $11.7 billion   and   $10.3 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The Company can terminate these contracts at any time through cash settlement with the counterparty at an amount equal to the then current estimated fair value of the credit default swaps. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company would have received   $140 million   and   $65 million  , respectively, to terminate all of these contracts.

           (1) 
    The rating agency designations are based on availability and the midpoint of the applicable ratings among Moody s Investors Service ( Moody s ), Standard   Poor s Ratings Services ( S P ) and Fitch Ratings. If no rating is available from a rating agency, then an internally developed rating is used. 
              (2) 
    The weighted average years to maturity of the credit default swaps is calculated based on weighted average gross notional amounts. 
     The Company has also entered into credit default swaps to purchase credit protection on certain of the referenced credit obligations in the table above. As a result, the maximum amounts of potential future recoveries available to offset the   $11.7 billion   and   $10.3 billion   from the table above were   $30 million   and   $80 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , there were no written credit default swaps held in relation to the trading portfolio. At   December 31, 2015  , written credit default swaps held in relation to the trading portfolio amounted to   $20 million   in gross notional amount and   ($2) million   in estimated fair value. 
   
  Credit Risk on Freestanding Derivatives 
  The Company may be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by its counterparties to derivatives. Generally, the current credit exposure of the Company s derivatives is limited to the net positive estimated fair value of derivatives at the reporting date after taking into consideration the existence of master netting or similar agreements and any collateral received pursuant to such agreements.

The Company manages its credit risk related to derivatives by entering into transactions with creditworthy counterparties and establishing and monitoring exposure limits. The Company s OTC-bilateral derivative transactions are generally governed by ISDA Master Agreements which provide for legally enforceable set-off and close-out netting of exposures to specific counterparties in the event of early termination of a transaction, which includes, but is not limited to, events of default and bankruptcy. In the event of an early termination, the Company is permitted to set off receivables from the counterparty against payables to the same counterparty arising out of all included transactions. Substantially all of the Company s ISDA Master Agreements also include Credit Support Annex provisions which require both the pledging and accepting of collateral in connection with its OTC-bilateral derivatives. 
  The Company s OTC-cleared derivatives are effected through central clearing counterparties and its exchange-traded derivatives are effected through regulated exchanges. Such positions are marked to market and margined on a daily basis (both initial margin and variation margin), and the Company has minimal exposure to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to such derivatives. 
  See   Note   9     for   a description of the impact of credit risk on the valuation of derivatives. 
  The estimated fair values of the Company s net derivative assets and net derivative liabilities after the application of master netting agreements and collateral were as follows at:

           (1) 
    See   Note 7   for information regarding the Company s gross and net payables and receivables under repurchase agreement transactions. 
              (2) 
    At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , derivative assets included income or expense accruals reported in accrued investment income or in other liabilities of   $333 million   and   $278 million  , respectively, and derivative liabilities included income or expense accruals reported in accrued investment income or in other liabilities of   ($11) million   and   $41 million  , respectively.

(3) 
    Estimated fair value of derivatives is limited to the amount that is subject to set-off and includes income or expense accruals. 
              (4) 
    Cash collateral received by the Company for OTC-bilateral and OTC-cleared derivatives is included in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments or in fixed maturity securities, and the obligation to return it is included in payables for collateral under securities loaned and other transactions on the balance sheet. 
              (5) 
    The receivable for the return of cash collateral provided by the Company is inclusive of initial margin on exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivatives and is included in premiums, reinsurance and other receivables on the balance sheet. The amount of cash collateral offset in the table above is limited to the net estimated fair value of derivatives after application of netting agreements. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company received excess cash collateral of   $554 million   and   $89 million  , respectively, and provided excess cash collateral of   $432 million   and   $204 million  , respectively, which is not included in the table above due to the foregoing limitation. 
              (6) 
    Securities collateral received by the Company is held in separate custodial accounts and is not recorded on the balance sheet. Subject to certain constraints, the Company is permitted by contract to sell or re-pledge this collateral, but at   September 30, 2016  ,   none   of the collateral had been sold or re-pledged. Securities collateral pledged by the Company is reported in fixed maturity securities on the balance sheet. Subject to certain constraints, the counterparties are permitted by contract to sell or re-pledge this collateral. The amount of securities collateral offset in the table above is limited to the net estimated fair value of derivatives after application of netting agreements and cash collateral. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company received excess securities collateral with an estimated fair value of   $137 million   and   $100 million  , respectively, for its OTC-bilateral derivatives, which are not included in the table above due to the foregoing limitation. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company provided excess securities collateral with an estimated fair value of   $185 million   and   $150 million  , respectively, for its OTC-bilateral derivatives, and   $960 million   and   $315 million  , respectively, for its OTC-cleared derivatives, and   $462 million   and   $224 million  , respectively, for its exchange-traded derivatives, which are not included in the table above due to the foregoing limitation. 
     The Company s collateral arrangements for its OTC-bilateral derivatives generally require the party in a net liability position, after considering the effect of netting agreements, to pledge collateral when the estimated fair value of that party s derivatives reaches a minimum transfer amount. A small number of these arrangements also include credit-contingent provisions that include a threshold above which collateral must be posted. Such agreements provide for a reduction of these thresholds (on a sliding scale that converges toward zero) in the event of downgrades in the credit ratings of MetLife, Inc. and/or the counterparty. In addition, substantially all of the Company s netting agreements for derivatives contain provisions that require both the Company and the counterparty to maintain a specific investment grade credit rating from each of Moody s and S P. If a party s credit or financial strength rating, as applicable, were to fall below that specific investment grade credit rating, that party would be in violation of these provisions, and the other party to the derivatives could terminate the transactions and demand immediate settlement and payment based on such party s reasonable valuation of the derivatives. 
  The following table presents the estimated fair value of the Company s OTC-bilateral derivatives that are in a net liability position after considering the effect of netting agreements, together with the estimated fair value and balance sheet location of the collateral pledged. The table also presents the incremental collateral that MetLife, Inc. would be required to provide if there was a one-notch downgrade in MetLife, Inc. s senior unsecured debt rating at the reporting date or if the Company s credit or financial strength rating, as applicable, sustained a downgrade to a level that triggered full overnight collateralization or termination of the derivative position at the reporting date. OTC-bilateral derivatives that are not subject to collateral agreements are excluded from this table.

  Embedded Derivatives 
  The Company issues certain products or purchases certain investments that contain embedded derivatives that are required to be separated from their host contracts and accounted for as freestanding derivatives. These host contracts principally include: variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits, including GMWBs, GMABs and certain GMIBs; ceded reinsurance of guaranteed minimum benefits related to certain GMIBs; assumed reinsurance of guaranteed minimum benefits related to GMWBs and GMABs; funding agreements with equity or bond indexed crediting rates; funds withheld on assumed and ceded reinsurance; fixed annuities with equity-indexed returns; and certain debt and equity securities. 
  The following table presents the estimated fair value and balance sheet location of the Company s embedded derivatives that have been separated from their host contracts at:

The following table presents changes in estimated fair value related to embedded derivatives: 

__________________ 
           (1) 
    The valuation of guaranteed minimum benefits includes a nonperformance risk adjustment. The amounts included in net derivative gains (losses) in connection with this adjustment were     ($224) million     and     $1.2 billion     for the     three months     and     nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and     $253 million     and     $222 million     for the     three months     and     nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
      
  9. Fair Value 
   
  Considerable judgment is often required in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value, and the use of different assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. 
  Recurring Fair Value Measurements 
  The assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding placement in the fair value hierarchy, including those items for which the Company has elected the FVO, are presented below at:

    Derivative assets are presented within other invested assets on the consolidated balance sheets and derivative liabilities are presented within other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The amounts are presented gross in the tables above to reflect the presentation on the consolidated balance sheets, but are presented net for purposes of the rollforward in the Fair Value Measurements Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) tables. 
              (3) 
    Net embedded derivatives within asset host contracts are presented within premiums, reinsurance and other receivables and other invested assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Net embedded derivatives within liability host contracts are presented within policyholder account balances, future policy benefits and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , debt and equity securities also included embedded derivatives of   ($240) million   and   ($220) million  , respectively. 
              (4) 
    Investment performance related to separate account assets is fully offset by corresponding amounts credited to contractholders whose liability is reflected within separate account liabilities. Separate account liabilities are set equal to the estimated fair value of separate account assets. Separate account liabilities presented in the tables above represent derivative liabilities. 
              (5) 
    Trading liabilities are presented within other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. 
      
  The following describes the valuation methodologies used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. The description includes the valuation techniques and key inputs for each category of assets or liabilities that are classified within Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  Investments 
  Valuation Controls and Procedures 
  On behalf of the Company s Chief Investment Officer and Chief Financial Officer, a pricing and valuation committee that is independent of the trading and investing functions and comprised of senior management, provides oversight of control systems and valuation policies for securities, mortgage loans and derivatives. On a quarterly basis, this committee reviews and approves new transaction types and markets, ensures that observable market prices and market-based parameters are used for valuation, wherever possible, and determines that judgmental valuation adjustments, when applied, are based upon established policies and are applied consistently over time. This committee also provides oversight of the selection of independent third-party pricing providers and the controls and procedures to evaluate third-party pricing. Periodically, the Chief Accounting Officer reports to the Audit Committee of MetLife, Inc. s Board of Directors regarding compliance with fair value accounting standards. 
  The Company reviews its valuation methodologies on an ongoing basis and revises those methodologies when necessary based on changing market conditions. Assurance is gained on the overall reasonableness and consistent application of input assumptions, valuation methodologies and compliance with fair value accounting standards through controls designed to ensure valuations represent an exit price. Several controls are utilized, including certain monthly controls, which include, but are not limited to, analysis of portfolio returns to corresponding benchmark returns, comparing a sample of executed prices of securities sold to the fair value estimates, comparing fair value estimates to management s knowledge of the current market, reviewing the bid/ask spreads to assess activity, comparing prices from multiple independent pricing services and ongoing due diligence to confirm that independent pricing services use market-based parameters. The process includes a determination of the observability of inputs used in estimated fair values received from independent pricing services or brokers by assessing whether these inputs can be corroborated by observable market data. The Company ensures that prices received from independent brokers, also referred to herein as  consensus pricing,  represent a reasonable estimate of fair value by considering such pricing relative to the Company s knowledge of the current market dynamics and current pricing for similar financial instruments. While independent non-binding broker quotations are utilized, they are not used for a significant portion of the portfolio. For example, fixed maturity securities priced using independent non-binding broker quotations represent less than   1%   of the total estimated fair value of fixed maturity securities and   5%   of the total estimated fair value of Level 3 fixed maturity securities at   September 30, 2016  .

  9. Fair Value (continued) 

The Company also applies a formal process to challenge any prices received from independent pricing services that are not considered representative of estimated fair value. If prices received from independent pricing services are not considered reflective of market activity or representative of estimated fair value, independent non-binding broker quotations are obtained, or an internally developed valuation is prepared. Internally developed valuations of current estimated fair value, which reflect internal estimates of liquidity and nonperformance risks, compared with pricing received from the independent pricing services, did not produce material differences in the estimated fair values for the majority of the portfolio; accordingly, overrides were not material. This is, in part, because internal estimates of liquidity and nonperformance risks are generally based on available market evidence and estimates used by other market participants. In the absence of such market-based evidence, management s best estimate is used. 
  Securities, Short-term Investments, Other Investments, Long-term Debt of CSEs   FVO and Trading Liabilities 
  When available, the estimated fair value of these financial instruments is based on quoted prices in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable. Generally, these are the most liquid of the Company s securities holdings and valuation of these securities does not involve management s judgment. 
  When quoted prices in active markets are not available, the determination of estimated fair value is based on market standard valuation methodologies, giving priority to observable inputs. The significant inputs to the market standard valuation methodologies for certain types of securities with reasonable levels of price transparency are inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. When observable inputs are not available, the market standard valuation methodologies rely on inputs that are significant to the estimated fair value that are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. These unobservable inputs can be based in large part on management s judgment or estimation and cannot be supported by reference to market activity. Even though these inputs are unobservable, management believes they are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such securities and are considered appropriate given the circumstances. 
  The estimated fair value of investments in certain separate accounts included in FVO contractholder-directed unit-linked investments, FVO securities held by CSEs, other investments, long-term debt of CSEs   FVO and trading liabilities is determined on a basis consistent with the methodologies described herein for securities. 
  The valuation of most instruments listed below is determined using independent pricing sources, matrix pricing, discounted cash flow methodologies or other similar techniques that use either observable market inputs or unobservable inputs.

  9. Fair Value (continued) 

Derivatives 
  The estimated fair value of derivatives is determined through the use of quoted market prices for exchange-traded derivatives, or through the use of pricing models for OTC-bilateral and OTC-cleared derivatives. The determination of estimated fair value, when quoted market values are not available, is based on market standard valuation methodologies and inputs that management believes are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such instruments. Derivative valuations can be affected by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, financial indices, credit spreads, default risk, nonperformance risk, volatility, liquidity and changes in estimates and assumptions used in the pricing models. The valuation controls and procedures for derivatives are described in    Investments.  
  The significant inputs to the pricing models for most OTC-bilateral and OTC-cleared derivatives are inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. Certain OTC-bilateral and OTC-cleared derivatives may rely on inputs that are significant to the estimated fair value that are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. These unobservable inputs may involve significant management judgment or estimation. Even though unobservable, these inputs are based on assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances and management believes they are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such instruments. 
  Most inputs for OTC-bilateral and OTC-cleared derivatives are mid-market inputs but, in certain cases, liquidity adjustments are made when they are deemed more representative of exit value. Market liquidity, as well as the use of different methodologies, assumptions and inputs, may have a material effect on the estimated fair values of the Company s derivatives and could materially affect net income. 
  The credit risk of both the counterparty and the Company are considered in determining the estimated fair value for all OTC-bilateral and OTC-cleared derivatives, and any potential credit adjustment is based on the net exposure by counterparty after taking into account the effects of netting agreements and collateral arrangements. The Company values its OTC-bilateral and OTC-cleared derivatives using standard swap curves which may include a spread to the risk-free rate, depending upon specific collateral arrangements. This credit spread is appropriate for those parties that execute trades at pricing levels consistent with similar collateral arrangements. As the Company and its significant derivative counterparties generally execute trades at such pricing levels and hold sufficient collateral, additional credit risk adjustments are not currently required in the valuation process. The Company s ability to consistently execute at such pricing levels is in part due to the netting agreements and collateral arrangements that are in place with all of its significant derivative counterparties. An evaluation of the requirement to make additional credit risk adjustments is performed by the Company each reporting period. 
  Freestanding Derivatives 
  Level 2 Valuation Techniques and Key Inputs: 
  This level includes all types of derivatives utilized by the Company with the exception of exchange-traded derivatives included within Level 1 and those derivatives with unobservable inputs as described in Level 3. 
  Level 3 Valuation Techniques and Key Inputs: 
  These valuation methodologies generally use the same inputs as described in the corresponding sections for Level 2 measurements of derivatives. However, these derivatives result in Level 3 classification because one or more of the significant inputs are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.

    Extrapolation beyond the observable limits of the curve(s). 
     Embedded Derivatives 
  Embedded derivatives principally include certain direct, assumed and ceded variable annuity guarantees, equity or bond indexed crediting rates within certain funding agreements and annuity contracts, and those related to funds withheld on ceded reinsurance agreements. Embedded derivatives are recorded at estimated fair value with changes in estimated fair value reported in net income. 
  The Company issues certain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits. GMWBs, GMABs and certain GMIBs contain embedded derivatives, which are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract, with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains (losses). These embedded derivatives are classified within policyholder account balances and future policy benefits on the consolidated balance sheets. 
  The Company s actuarial department calculates the fair value of these embedded derivatives, which are estimated as the present value of projected future benefits minus the present value of projected future fees using actuarial and capital market assumptions including expectations concerning policyholder behavior. The calculation is based on in-force business, and is performed using standard actuarial valuation software which projects future cash flows from the embedded derivative over multiple risk neutral stochastic scenarios using observable risk-free rates. 
  Capital market assumptions, such as risk-free rates and implied volatilities, are based on market prices for publicly traded instruments to the extent that prices for such instruments are observable. Implied volatilities beyond the observable period are extrapolated based on observable implied volatilities and historical volatilities. Actuarial assumptions, including mortality, lapse, withdrawal and utilization, are unobservable and are reviewed at least annually based on actuarial studies of historical experience. 
  The valuation of these guarantee liabilities includes nonperformance risk adjustments and adjustments for a risk margin related to non-capital market inputs. The nonperformance adjustment is determined by taking into consideration publicly available information relating to spreads in the secondary market for MetLife, Inc. s debt, including related credit default swaps. These observable spreads are then adjusted, as necessary, to reflect the priority of these liabilities and the claims paying ability of the issuing insurance subsidiaries compared to MetLife, Inc.

Risk margins are established to capture the non-capital market risks of the instrument which represent the additional compensation a market participant would require to assume the risks related to the uncertainties of such actuarial assumptions as annuitization, premium persistency, partial withdrawal and surrenders. The establishment of risk margins requires the use of significant management judgment, including assumptions of the amount and cost of capital needed to cover the guarantees. These guarantees may be more costly than expected in volatile or declining equity markets. Market conditions including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates, equity indices, market volatility and foreign currency exchange rates; changes in nonperformance risk; and variations in actuarial assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, mortality and risk margins related to non-capital market inputs, may result in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the guarantees that could materially affect net income. 
  The Company ceded the risk associated with certain of the GMIBs previously described. These reinsurance agreements contain embedded derivatives which are included within premiums, reinsurance and other receivables on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains (losses) or policyholder benefits and claims depending on the statement of operations classification of the direct risk. The value of the embedded derivatives on the ceded risk is determined using a methodology consistent with that described previously for the guarantees directly written by the Company with the exception of the input for nonperformance risk that reflects the credit of the reinsurer. 
  The estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives within funds withheld related to certain ceded reinsurance is determined based on the change in estimated fair value of the underlying assets held by the Company in a reference portfolio backing the funds withheld liability. The estimated fair value of the underlying assets is determined as previously described in    Investments   Securities, Short-term Investments, Other Investments, Long-term Debt of CSEs   FVO and Trading Liabilities.  The estimated fair value of these embedded derivatives is included, along with their funds withheld hosts, in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in estimated fair value recorded in net derivative gains (losses). Changes in the credit spreads on the underlying assets, interest rates and market volatility may result in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of these embedded derivatives that could materially affect net income. 
  The estimated fair value of the embedded equity and bond indexed derivatives contained in certain funding agreements is determined using market standard swap valuation models and observable market inputs, including a nonperformance risk adjustment. The estimated fair value of these embedded derivatives are included, along with their funding agreements host, within policyholder account balances with changes in estimated fair value recorded in net derivative gains (losses). Changes in equity and bond indices, interest rates and the Company s credit standing may result in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of these embedded derivatives that could materially affect net income. 
  The Company issues certain annuity contracts which allow the policyholder to participate in returns from equity indices. These equity indexed features are embedded derivatives which are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host fixed annuity contract, with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains (losses). These embedded derivatives are classified within policyholder account balances on the consolidated balance sheets. 
  The estimated fair value of the embedded equity indexed derivatives, based on the present value of future equity returns to the policyholder using actuarial and present value assumptions including expectations concerning policyholder behavior, is calculated by the Company s actuarial department. The calculation is based on in-force business and uses standard capital market techniques, such as Black-Scholes, to calculate the value of the portion of the embedded derivative for which the terms are set. The portion of the embedded derivative covering the period beyond where terms are set is calculated as the present value of amounts expected to be spent to provide equity indexed returns in those periods. The valuation of these embedded derivatives also includes the establishment of a risk margin, as well as changes in nonperformance risk.

Embedded Derivatives Within Asset and Liability Host Contracts 
  Level 3 Valuation Techniques and Key Inputs: 
  Direct and assumed guaranteed minimum benefits 
  These embedded derivatives are principally valued using the income approach. Valuations are based on option pricing techniques, which utilize significant inputs that may include swap yield curves, currency exchange rates and implied volatilities. These embedded derivatives result in Level 3 classification because one or more of the significant inputs are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. Significant unobservable inputs generally include: the extrapolation beyond observable limits of the swap yield curves and implied volatilities, actuarial assumptions for policyholder behavior and mortality and the potential variability in policyholder behavior and mortality, nonperformance risk and cost of capital for purposes of calculating the risk margin. 
  Reinsurance ceded on certain guaranteed minimum benefits 
  These embedded derivatives are principally valued using the income approach. The valuation techniques and significant market standard unobservable inputs used in their valuation are similar to those described above in    Direct and assumed guaranteed minimum benefits  and also include counterparty credit spreads. 
   
  Transfers between Levels 
  Overall, transfers between levels occur when there are changes in the observability of inputs and market activity. Transfers into or out of any level are assumed to occur at the beginning of the period. 
  Transfers between Levels 1 and 2: 
  For assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value and still held at   September 30, 2016  , transfers between Levels 1 and 2 were not significant. For assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value and still held at   December 31, 2015  , transfers between Levels 1 and 2 were   $203 million  . 
  Transfers into or out of Level 3: 
  Assets and liabilities are transferred into Level 3 when a significant input cannot be corroborated with market observable data. This occurs when market activity decreases significantly and underlying inputs cannot be observed, current prices are not available, and/or when there are significant variances in quoted prices, thereby affecting transparency. Assets and liabilities are transferred out of Level 3 when circumstances change such that a significant input can be corroborated with market observable data. This may be due to a significant increase in market activity, a specific event, or one or more significant input(s) becoming observable.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) 
  The following table presents certain quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement, and the sensitivity of the estimated fair value to changes in those inputs, for the more significant asset and liability classes measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) at:

    The weighted average for fixed maturity securities is determined based on the estimated fair value of the securities. 
              (2) 
    The impact of a decrease in input would have the opposite impact on estimated fair value. For embedded derivatives, changes to direct and assumed guaranteed minimum benefits are based on liability positions; changes to ceded guaranteed minimum benefits are based on asset positions.

    Changes in the assumptions used for the probability of default is accompanied by a directionally similar change in the assumption used for the loss severity and a directionally opposite change in the assumptions used for prepayment rates. 
              (7) 
    Ranges represent the rates across different yield curves and are presented in basis points. The swap yield curves are utilized among different types of derivatives to project cash flows, as well as to discount future cash flows to present value. Since this valuation methodology uses a range of inputs across a yield curve to value the derivative, presenting a range is more representative of the unobservable input used in the valuation. 
              (8) 
    Changes in estimated fair value are based on long U.S. dollar net asset positions and will be inversely impacted for short U.S. dollar net asset positions. 
              (9) 
    Ranges represent different repurchase rates utilized as components within the valuation methodology and are presented in basis points. 
              (10) 
    Represents the risk quoted in basis points of a credit default event on the underlying instrument. Credit derivatives with significant unobservable inputs are primarily comprised of written credit default swaps. 
              (11) 
    At both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , independent non-binding broker quotations were used in the determination of less than   1%   of the total net derivative estimated fair value. 
              (12) 
    Ranges represent the underlying equity volatility quoted in percentage points. Since this valuation methodology uses a range of inputs across multiple volatility surfaces to value the derivative, presenting a range is more representative of the unobservable input used in the valuation. 
              (13) 
    Ranges represent the different correlation factors utilized as components within the valuation methodology. Presenting a range of correlation factors is more representative of the unobservable input used in the valuation. Increases (decreases) in correlation in isolation will increase (decrease) the significance of the change in valuations. 
              (14) 
    Mortality rates vary by age and by demographic characteristics such as gender. Mortality rate assumptions are based on company experience. A mortality improvement assumption is also applied. For any given contract, mortality rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the embedded derivative. 
              (15) 
    Base lapse rates are adjusted at the contract level based on a comparison of the actuarially calculated guaranteed values and the current policyholder account value, as well as other factors, such as the applicability of any surrender charges. A dynamic lapse function reduces the base lapse rate when the guaranteed amount is greater than the account value as in the money contracts are less likely to lapse. Lapse rates are also generally assumed to be lower in periods when a surrender charge applies. For any given contract, lapse rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the embedded derivative. 
              (16) 
    The utilization rate assumption estimates the percentage of contract holders with a GMIB or lifetime withdrawal benefit who will elect to utilize the benefit upon becoming eligible. The rates may vary by the type of guarantee, the amount by which the guaranteed amount is greater than the account value, the contract s withdrawal history and by the age of the policyholder. For any given contract, utilization rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the embedded derivative. 
              (17) 
    The withdrawal rate represents the percentage of account balance that any given policyholder will elect to withdraw from the contract each year. The withdrawal rate assumption varies by age and duration of the contract, and also by other factors such as benefit type. For any given contract, withdrawal rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the embedded derivative. For GMWBs, any increase (decrease) in withdrawal rates results in an increase (decrease) in the estimated fair value of the guarantees. For GMABs and GMIBs, any increase (decrease) in withdrawal rates results in a decrease (increase) in the estimated fair value. 
              (18) 
    Long-term equity volatilities represent equity volatility beyond the period for which observable equity volatilities are available. For any given contract, long-term equity volatility rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the embedded derivative. 
              (19) 
    Nonperformance risk spread varies by duration and by currency. For any given contract, multiple nonperformance risk spreads will apply, depending on the duration of the cash flow being discounted for purposes of valuing the embedded derivative.

The following is a summary of the valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities classified within Level 3 that are not included in the preceding table. Generally, all other classes of securities classified within Level 3, including those within separate account assets and embedded derivatives within funds withheld related to certain ceded and assumed reinsurance, use the same valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs as previously described for Level 3 securities. This includes matrix pricing and discounted cash flow methodologies, inputs such as quoted prices for identical or similar securities that are less liquid and based on lower levels of trading activity than securities classified in Level 2, as well as independent non-binding broker quotations. The residential mortgage loans   FVO and long-term debt of CSEs   FVO are valued using independent non-binding broker quotations and internal models including matrix pricing and discounted cash flow methodologies using current interest rates. The sensitivity of the estimated fair value to changes in the significant unobservable inputs for these other assets and liabilities is similar in nature to that described in the preceding table. The valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement for the more significant assets measured at estimated fair value on a nonrecurring basis and determined using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) are summarized in    Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements 
  The following table presents information for assets measured at estimated fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the periods and still held at the reporting dates (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). The estimated fair values for these assets were determined using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). 

__________________ 
           (1) 
    Estimated fair values for impaired mortgage loans are based on independent broker quotations or valuation models using unobservable inputs or, if the loans are in foreclosure or are otherwise determined to be collateral dependent, are based on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral or the present value of the expected future cash flows. 
              (2) 
    For these cost method investments, estimated fair value is determined from information provided on the financial statements of the underlying entities including NAV data. These investments include private equity and debt funds that typically invest primarily in various strategies including domestic and international leveraged buyout funds; power, energy, timber and infrastructure development funds; venture capital funds; and below investment grade debt and mezzanine debt funds. Distributions will be generated from investment gains, from operating income from the underlying investments of the funds and from liquidation of the underlying assets of the funds. It is estimated that the underlying assets of the funds will be liquidated over the next   two   to   10 years  . Unfunded commitments for these investments at both   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were not significant. 
              (3) 
    During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized an impairment of computer software in connection with the U.S. Retail Advisor Force Divestiture. See   Note 3  . 
              (4) 
    As discussed in   Note 10  , for both the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded an impairment of goodwill associated with the reporting units within the Brighthouse Financial segment. 
      
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments Carried at Other Than Fair Value 
  The following tables provide fair value information for financial instruments that are carried on the balance sheet at amounts other than fair value. These tables exclude the following financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, accrued investment income, payables for collateral under securities loaned and other transactions, short-term debt and those short-term investments that are not securities, such as time deposits, and therefore are not included in the three level hierarchy table disclosed in the    Recurring Fair Value Measurements  section. The estimated fair value of the excluded financial instruments, which are primarily classified in Level 2, approximates carrying value as they are short-term in nature such that the Company believes there is minimal risk of material changes in interest rates or credit quality. All remaining balance sheet amounts excluded from the tables below are not considered financial instruments subject to this disclosure.

  MetLife, Inc. 
  Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)   (continued) 
  9. Fair Value (continued) 

The methods, assumptions and significant valuation techniques and inputs used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments are summarized as follows: 
  Mortgage Loans 
  The estimated fair value of mortgage loans is primarily determined by estimating expected future cash flows and discounting them using current interest rates for similar mortgage loans with similar credit risk, or is determined from pricing for similar loans. 
  Policy Loans 
  Policy loans with fixed interest rates are classified within Level 3. The estimated fair values for these loans are determined using a discounted cash flow model applied to groups of similar policy loans determined by the nature of the underlying insurance liabilities. Cash flow estimates are developed by applying a weighted-average interest rate to the outstanding principal balance of the respective group of policy loans and an estimated average maturity determined through experience studies of the past performance of policyholder repayment behavior for similar loans. These cash flows are discounted using current risk-free interest rates with no adjustment for borrower credit risk, as these loans are fully collateralized by the cash surrender value of the underlying insurance policy. Policy loans with variable interest rates are classified within Level 2 and the estimated fair value approximates carrying value due to the absence of borrower credit risk and the short time period between interest rate resets, which presents minimal risk of a material change in estimated fair value due to changes in market interest rates. 
  Real Estate Joint Ventures and Other Limited Partnership Interests 
  The estimated fair values of these cost method investments are generally based on the Company s share of the NAV as provided on the financial statements of the investees. In certain circumstances, management may adjust the NAV by a premium or discount when it has sufficient evidence to support applying such adjustments. 
  Other Invested Assets 
  These other invested assets are principally comprised of various interest-bearing assets held in foreign subsidiaries and certain amounts due under contractual indemnifications. For the various interest-bearing assets held in foreign subsidiaries, the Company evaluates the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument to determine the appropriate estimated fair values. These estimated fair values were not materially different from the recognized carrying values. 
  Premiums, Reinsurance and Other Receivables 
  Premiums, reinsurance and other receivables are principally comprised of certain amounts recoverable under reinsurance agreements, amounts on deposit with financial institutions to facilitate daily settlements related to certain derivatives and amounts receivable for securities sold but not yet settled. 
  Amounts recoverable under ceded reinsurance agreements, which the Company has determined do not transfer significant risk such that they are accounted for using the deposit method of accounting, have been classified as Level 3. The valuation is based on discounted cash flow methodologies using significant unobservable inputs. The estimated fair value is determined using interest rates determined to reflect the appropriate credit standing of the assuming counterparty. 
  The amounts on deposit for derivative settlements, classified within Level 2, essentially represent the equivalent of demand deposit balances and amounts due for securities sold are generally received over short periods such that the estimated fair value approximates carrying value. 
  Other Assets 
  These other assets are principally comprised of a receivable for cash paid to an unaffiliated financial institution under the MetLife Reinsurance Company of Charleston ( MRC ) collateral financing arrangement described in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the   2015   Annual Report. The estimated fair value of the receivable for the cash paid to the unaffiliated financial institution under the MRC collateral financing arrangement is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows using a discount rate that reflects the credit rating of the unaffiliated financial institution.

  MetLife, Inc. 
  Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)   (continued) 
  9. Fair Value (continued) 

Policyholder Account Balances 
  These policyholder account balances include investment contracts which primarily include certain funding agreements, fixed deferred annuities, modified guaranteed annuities, fixed term payout annuities and total control accounts ( TCA ). The valuation of these investment contracts is based on discounted cash flow methodologies using significant unobservable inputs. The estimated fair value is determined using current market risk-free interest rates adding a spread to reflect the nonperformance risk in the liability. 
  Long-term Debt, Collateral Financing Arrangements and Junior Subordinated Debt Securities 
  The estimated fair values of long-term debt, collateral financing arrangements and junior subordinated debt securities are principally determined using market standard valuation methodologies. 
  Valuations of instruments classified as Level 2 are based primarily on quoted prices in markets that are not active or using matrix pricing that use standard market observable inputs such as quoted prices in markets that are not active and observable yields and spreads in the market. Instruments valued using discounted cash flow methodologies use standard market observable inputs including market yield curve, duration, call provisions, observable prices and spreads for similar publicly traded or privately traded issues. 
  Valuations of instruments classified as Level 3 are based primarily on discounted cash flow methodologies that utilize unobservable discount rates that can vary significantly based upon the specific terms of each individual arrangement. The determination of estimated fair values of collateral financing arrangements incorporates valuations obtained from the counterparties to the arrangements, as part of the collateral management process. 
  Other Liabilities 
  Other liabilities consist primarily of interest payable, amounts due for securities purchased but not yet settled, and funds withheld amounts payable, which are contractually withheld by the Company in accordance with the terms of the reinsurance agreements. The Company evaluates the specific terms, facts and circumstances of each instrument to determine the appropriate estimated fair values, which are not materially different from the carrying values, with the exception of certain deposit type reinsurance payables. For such payables, the estimated fair value is determined as the present value of expected future cash flows, which are discounted using an interest rate determined to reflect the appropriate credit standing of the assuming counterparty. 
  Separate Account Liabilities 
  Separate account liabilities represent those balances due to policyholders under contracts that are classified as investment contracts. 
  Separate account liabilities classified as investment contracts primarily represent variable annuities with no significant mortality risk to the Company such that the death benefit is equal to the account balance, funding agreements related to group life contracts and certain contracts that provide for benefit funding. 
  Since separate account liabilities are fully funded by cash flows from the separate account assets which are recognized at estimated fair value as described in the section    Recurring Fair Value Measurements,  the value of those assets approximates the estimated fair value of the related separate account liabilities. The valuation techniques and inputs for separate account liabilities are similar to those described for separate account assets.

10. Goodwill 
   
  The Company tests goodwill for impairment during the third quarter of each year at the reporting unit level based upon the best available data at June 30, of that year. A reporting unit is the operating segment or a business one level below the operating segment, if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at that level. Step 1 of the goodwill impairment process requires a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. To determine the fair values of its reporting units, the Company generally applies a market multiple, discounted cash flow, and/or an actuarial based valuation approach. The market multiple valuation approach utilizes market multiples of companies with similar businesses and the projected operating earnings of the reporting unit. The discounted cash flow valuation approach requires judgments about revenues, operating earnings projections, capital market assumptions and discount rates. The actuarial based approaches such as embedded value or cash flow testing estimate the net worth of the reporting unit and the value of existing and new business. The actuarial based approaches require judgments and assumptions about level of economic capital required to support the mix of business, long-term growth rates, the account value of in-force business, projections of new and renewal business, as well as margins on such business, the level of interest rates, credit spreads, equity market levels, and the discount rate that the Company believes is appropriate for the respective reporting unit. 
  In anticipation of the Separation, in the third quarter of 2016, MetLife reorganized its businesses into six segments: U.S.; Asia; Latin America; EMEA; MetLife Holdings; and Brighthouse Financial. In connection with the reorganization, MetLife realigned certain businesses among its existing and new segments. As a result, the Company reallocated goodwill based on the relative fair values of the reporting units within such segments. 
  Based on a quantitative analysis performed for the Life and Run-off reporting units within the Brighthouse Financial segment, the Company concluded that the carrying values of these reporting units exceeded their estimated fair values, indicating a potential for goodwill impairment. Accordingly, the Company performed Step 2 of the goodwill impairment process for each of the reporting units, which compares the implied estimated fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying value. This analysis indicated that the goodwill associated with these reporting units was not recoverable. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash charge in the aggregate of   $260 million   (  $223 million  , net of income tax) for the impairment of the entire goodwill balance, which is reported in goodwill impairment in the interim condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for both the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
  In addition, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment tests of all other reporting units during the third quarter of 2016 using a qualitative assessment and/or quantitative assessments under the market multiple, discounted cash flow and/or actuarial based valuation approaches based on best available data as of June 30, 2016 and concluded that the estimated fair values of all such reporting units were in excess of their carrying values and, therefore, goodwill was not impaired.  
  Management continues to evaluate current market conditions that may affect the estimated fair value of the reporting units to assess whether any goodwill impairment exists. Deteriorating or adverse market conditions for certain reporting units may have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units and could result in future impairments of goodwill.  
  Information regarding goodwill by segment, as well as Corporate   Other, was as follows:

    The   $1.9 billion   accumulated impairment relates to the retail annuities business, which was impaired in 2012 and includes the allocated goodwill from Corporate   Other. Although the entire balance is reflected in the MetLife Holdings segment, it also relates to the retail annuities business within the Brighthouse Financial segment. 
              (2) 
    In conjunction with the U.S. Retail Advisor Force Divestiture, the Company reduced goodwill in Corporate   Other by   $42 million   during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. See Note 3. 
      
  11. Equity  
   
  Preferred Stock 
  Preferred stock authorized, issued and outstanding was as follows at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Common Stock  
  During     the     nine months ended     September 30, 2016     and     2015  , MetLife, Inc. repurchased     1,445,864   and     22,475,816     shares through open market purchases for     $70 million     and     $1.1 billion  , res  pectively. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , MetLife, Inc. had no remaining common stock repurchase authorizations. Common stock repurchases are dependent upon several factors, including the Company s capital position, liquidity, financial strength and credit ratings, general market conditions, the market price of MetLife, Inc. s common stock compared to management s assessment of the stock s underlying value and applicable regulatory approvals, as well as other legal and accounting factors. 
   
  Stock-Based Compensation Plans 
  Performance Shares and Performance Units 
  Awards under the MetLife, Inc. 2005 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan and the MetLife, Inc. 2015 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan (the  2015 Stock Plan ) were outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . All awards granted in 2015 or later were granted under the 2015 Stock Plan. There were no outstanding awards to MetLife, Inc. directors, for their service as directors, as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  For Performance Share and Performance Unit awards outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  , any vested Performance Shares and Performance Units will be multiplied by a performance factor of   0%   to   175%  . Assuming that MetLife, Inc. has met threshold performance goals related to its adjusted income or total shareholder return, the MetLife, Inc. Compensation Committee will determine the performance factor in its discretion. In doing so, the Compensation Committee may consider MetLife, Inc. s total shareholder return relative to the performance of its competitors and MetLife, Inc. s operating return on equity relative to its business plan. The estimated fair value of Performance Shares and Performance Units will be remeasured each quarter until they become payable. 
  Payout of 2013   2015 Performance Shares and Performance Units 
  Final Performance Shares are paid in shares of MetLife, Inc. common stock. Final Performance Units are payable in cash equal to the closing price of MetLife, Inc. common stock on a date following the last day of the three-year performance period. The performance factor for the January 1, 2013   December 31, 2015 performance period was   86.2%  . This factor has been applied to the   1,592,650   Performance Shares and   234,787   Performance Units associated with that performance period that vested on   December 31, 2015  . As a result, in the first quarter of 2016, MetLife, Inc. issued   1,372,864   shares of its common stock (less withholding for taxes and other items, as applicable), excluding shares that payees choose to defer, and MetLife, Inc. or its affiliates paid the cash value of   202,386   units (less withholding for taxes and other items, as applicable).

  Contingencies 
  Litigation 
  The Company is a defendant in a large number of litigation matters. In some of the matters, very large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages, are sought. Modern pleading practice in the U.S. permits considerable variation in the assertion of monetary damages or other relief. Jurisdictions may permit claimants not to specify the monetary damages sought or may permit claimants to state only that the amount sought is sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the trial court. In addition, jurisdictions may permit plaintiffs to allege monetary damages in amounts well exceeding reasonably possible verdicts in the jurisdiction for similar matters. This variability in pleadings, together with the actual experience of the Company in litigating or resolving through settlement numerous claims over an extended period of time, demonstrates to management that the monetary relief which may be specified in a lawsuit or claim bears little relevance to its merits or disposition value. 
  Due to the vagaries of litigation, the outcome of a litigation matter and the amount or range of potential loss at particular points in time may normally be difficult to ascertain. Uncertainties can include how fact finders will evaluate documentary evidence and the credibility and effectiveness of witness testimony, and how trial and appellate courts will apply the law in the context of the pleadings or evidence presented, whether by motion practice, or at trial or on appeal. Disposition valuations are also subject to the uncertainty of how opposing parties and their counsel will themselves view the relevant evidence and applicable law. 
  The Company establishes liabilities for litigation and regulatory loss contingencies when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities have been established for a number of the matters noted below. It is possible that some of the matters could require the Company to pay damages or make other expenditures or establish accruals in amounts that could not be reasonably estimated at   September 30, 2016  . While the potential future charges could be material in the particular quarterly or annual periods in which they are recorded, based on information currently known to management, management does not believe any such charges are likely to have a material effect on the Company s financial position.

Matters as to Which an Estimate Can Be Made  
  For some of the matters disclosed below, the Company is able to estimate a reasonably possible range of loss. For such matters where a loss is believed to be reasonably possible, but not probable, no accrual has been made. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts accrued for these matters to be   $0   to   $400 million  . 
  Matters as to Which an Estimate Cannot Be Made 
  For other matters disclosed below, the Company is not currently able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss. The Company is often unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss until developments in such matters have provided sufficient information to support an assessment of the range of possible loss, such as quantification of a damage demand from plaintiffs, discovery from other parties and investigation of factual allegations, rulings by the court on motions or appeals, analysis by experts, and the progress of settlement negotiations. On a quarterly and annual basis, the Company reviews relevant information with respect to litigation contingencies and updates its accruals, disclosures and estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of loss based on such reviews. 
  Asbestos-Related Claims 
  MLIC is and has been a defendant in a large number of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts. These suits principally allege that the plaintiff or plaintiffs suffered personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos and seek both actual and punitive damages. MLIC has never engaged in the business of manufacturing, producing, distributing or selling asbestos or asbestos-containing products nor has MLIC issued liability or workers  compensation insurance to companies in the business of manufacturing, producing, distributing or selling asbestos or asbestos-containing products. The lawsuits principally have focused on allegations with respect to certain research, publication and other activities of one or more of MLIC s employees during the period from the 1920 s through approximately the 1950 s and allege that MLIC learned or should have learned of certain health risks posed by asbestos and, among other things, improperly publicized or failed to disclose those health risks. MLIC believes that it should not have legal liability in these cases. The outcome of most asbestos litigation matters, however, is uncertain and can be impacted by numerous variables, including differences in legal rulings in various jurisdictions, the nature of the alleged injury and factors unrelated to the ultimate legal merit of the claims asserted against MLIC. MLIC employs a number of resolution strategies to manage its asbestos loss exposure, including seeking resolution of pending litigation by judicial rulings and settling individual or groups of claims or lawsuits under appropriate circumstances. 
  Claims asserted against MLIC have included negligence, intentional tort and conspiracy concerning the health risks associated with asbestos. MLIC s defenses (beyond denial of certain factual allegations) include that: (i) MLIC owed no duty to the plaintiffs  it had no special relationship with the plaintiffs and did not manufacture, produce, distribute or sell the asbestos products that allegedly injured plaintiffs; (ii) plaintiffs did not rely on any actions of MLIC; (iii) MLIC s conduct was not the cause of the plaintiffs  injuries; (iv) plaintiffs  exposure occurred after the dangers of asbestos were known; and (v) the applicable time with respect to filing suit has expired. During the course of the litigation, certain trial courts have granted motions dismissing claims against MLIC, while other trial courts have denied MLIC s motions. There can be no assurance that MLIC will receive favorable decisions on motions in the future. While most cases brought to date have settled, MLIC intends to continue to defend aggressively against claims based on asbestos exposure, including defending claims at trials. 
  As reported in the   2015   Annual Report, MLIC received approximately   3,856   asbestos-related claims in   2015  . During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , MLIC received approximately   3,267   and   2,971   new asbestos-related claims, respectively. See Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the   2015   Annual Report for historical information concerning asbestos claims and MLIC s increase in its recorded liability at December 31,   2014  . The number of asbestos cases that may be brought, the aggregate amount of any liability that MLIC may incur, and the total amount paid in settlements in any given year are uncertain and may vary significantly from year to year.

  15. Contingencies, Commitments and Guarantees (continued) 

The ability of MLIC to estimate its ultimate asbestos exposure is subject to considerable uncertainty, and the conditions impacting its liability can be dynamic and subject to change. The availability of reliable data is limited and it is difficult to predict the numerous variables that can affect liability estimates, including the number of future claims, the cost to resolve claims, the disease mix and severity of disease in pending and future claims, the impact of the number of new claims filed in a particular jurisdiction and variations in the law in the jurisdictions in which claims are filed, the possible impact of tort reform efforts, the willingness of courts to allow plaintiffs to pursue claims against MLIC when exposure to asbestos took place after the dangers of asbestos exposure were well known, and the impact of any possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts. 
  The ability to make estimates regarding ultimate asbestos exposure declines significantly as the estimates relate to years further in the future. In the Company s judgment, there is a future point after which losses cease to be probable and reasonably estimable. It is reasonably possible that the Company s total exposure to asbestos claims may be materially greater than the asbestos liability currently accrued and that future charges to income may be necessary. While the potential future charges could be material in the particular quarterly or annual periods in which they are recorded, based on information currently known by management, management does not believe any such charges are likely to have a material effect on the Company s financial position. 
  The Company believes adequate provision has been made in its consolidated financial statements for all probable and reasonably estimable losses for asbestos-related claims. MLIC s recorded asbestos liability is based on its estimation of the following elements, as informed by the facts presently known to it, its understanding of current law and its past experiences: (i) the probable and reasonably estimable liability for asbestos claims already asserted against MLIC, including claims settled but not yet paid; (ii) the probable and reasonably estimable liability for asbestos claims not yet asserted against MLIC, but which MLIC believes are reasonably probable of assertion; and (iii) the legal defense costs associated with the foregoing claims. Significant assumptions underlying MLIC s analysis of the adequacy of its recorded liability with respect to asbestos litigation include: (i) the number of future claims; (ii) the cost to resolve claims; and (iii) the cost to defend claims. 
  MLIC reevaluates on a quarterly and annual basis its exposure from asbestos litigation, including studying its claims experience, reviewing external literature regarding asbestos claims experience in the United States, assessing relevant trends impacting asbestos liability and considering numerous variables that can affect its asbestos liability exposure on an overall or per claim basis. These variables include bankruptcies of other companies involved in asbestos litigation, legislative and judicial developments, the number of pending claims involving serious disease, the number of new claims filed against it and other defendants and the jurisdictions in which claims are pending. Based upon its regular reevaluation of its exposure from asbestos litigation, MLIC has updated its liability analysis for asbestos-related claims through   September 30, 2016  . 
  Regulatory Matters 
  The Company receives and responds to subpoenas or other inquiries seeking a broad range of information from state regulators, including state insurance commissioners; state attorneys general or other state governmental authorities; federal regulators, including the SEC; federal governmental authorities, including congressional committees; and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ), as well as from local and national regulators and government authorities in countries outside the United States where MetLife conducts business. The issues involved in information requests and regulatory matters vary widely. The Company cooperates in these inquiries. 
  Law Enforcement Inquiry Regarding Mortgage Servicing 
  MetLife, through its affiliate MetLife Bank, National Association ( MetLife Bank ), was engaged in the origination, sale and servicing of forward and reverse residential mortgage loans from 2008 to 2013. In May 2013, MetLife Bank received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice requiring production of documents relating to MetLife Bank s payment of certain foreclosure-related expenses to law firms and business entities affiliated with law firms and relating to MetLife Bank s supervision of such payments, including expenses submitted to the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for reimbursement. In August 2013, MetLife Bank merged with MetLife Home Loans LLC ( MLHL ) with MLHL as the surviving non-bank entity. Management believes that the Company s consolidated financial statements as a whole will not be materially affected by this matter.

In the Matter of Chemform, Inc. Site, Pompano Beach, Broward County, Florida 
  In July 2010, the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) advised MLIC that it believed payments were due under   two   settlement agreements, known as  Administrative Orders on Consent,  that New England Mutual Life Insurance Company signed in 1989 and 1992 with respect to the cleanup of a Superfund site in Florida (the  Chemform Site ). The EPA is requesting payment of an amount under   $1 million   from MLIC and a third party for past costs and an additional amount for future environmental testing costs at the Chemform Site. In September 2012, the EPA, MLIC and the third party executed an Administrative Order on Consent under which MLIC and the third party have agreed to be responsible for certain environmental testing at the Chemform Site. The Company estimates that its costs for the environmental testing will not exceed   $100,000  . The September 2012 Administrative Order on Consent does not resolve the EPA s claim for past clean-up costs. The EPA may seek additional costs if the environmental testing identifies issues. The Company estimates that the aggregate cost to resolve this matter will not exceed   $1 million  . 
  Sales Practices Regulatory Matters 
  Regulatory authorities in a number of states and FINRA, and occasionally the SEC, have had investigations or inquiries relating to sales of individual life insurance policies or annuities or other products by MLIC, MetLife USA, NELICO, General American Life Insurance Company ( GALIC ), FMLI, and MSI. These investigations often focus on the conduct of particular financial services representatives and the sale of unregistered or unsuitable products or the misuse of client assets. Over the past several years, these and a number of investigations by other regulatory authorities were resolved for monetary payments and certain other relief, including restitution payments. The Company may continue to resolve investigations in a similar manner. The Company believes adequate provision has been made in its consolidated financial statements for all probable and reasonably estimable losses for these sales practices-related investigations or inquiries. 
  Sale and Replacement of Variable Annuities and FINRA Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent 
  MSI has entered into a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent with FINRA (hereinafter, the  Letter ). In the Letter, FINRA stated that, from 2009 through 2014, MSI violated certain National Association of Securities Dealers and FINRA rules in connection with replacements of certain variable annuities and the sale of certain riders on such annuities. MSI was censured, paid a   $20 million   fine and an additional   $5 million   to impacted customers. 
  Unclaimed Property Litigation  
  West Virginia Lawsuits 
  On September 20, 2012, the West Virginia Treasurer filed an action against MLIC in West Virginia state court     (West Virginia ex rel. John D. Perdue v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, Circuit Court of Putnam County, Civil Action No. 12-C-295)     alleging that MLIC violated the West Virginia Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (the  Act ), seeking to compel compliance with the Act, and seeking payment of unclaimed property, interest, and penalties. On November 14, 2012, November 21, 2012, December 28, 2012, and January 9, 2013, the Treasurer filed substantially identical suits against MetLife Investors USA, NELICO, MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut and GALIC, respectively. On August 17, 2016, these companies and the West Virginia Treasurer reached an agreement in principle to resolve these actions. 
  City of Westland Police and Fire Retirement System v. MetLife, Inc., et. al. (S.D.N.Y., filed January 12, 2012) 
  Seeking to represent a class of persons who purchased MetLife, Inc. common shares between February 2, 2010, and October 6, 2011, the plaintiff filed a third amended complaint alleging that MetLife, Inc. and several current and former directors and executive officers of MetLife, Inc. violated the Securities Act of 1933 ( Securities Act ), as well as the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by issuing, or causing MetLife, Inc. to issue, materially false and misleading statements concerning MetLife, Inc. s potential liability for millions of dollars in insurance benefits that should have been paid to beneficiaries or escheated to the states. Plaintiff seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. The defendants intend to defend this action vigorously.

City of Birmingham Retirement and Relief System v. MetLife, Inc., et al. (Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Alabama, filed July 5, 2012) 
  Seeking to represent a class of persons who purchased MetLife, Inc. common equity units in or traceable to a public offering in March 2011, the plaintiff filed an action alleging that MetLife, Inc., certain current and former directors and executive officers of MetLife, Inc., and various underwriters violated several provisions of the Securities Act related to the filing of the registration statement by issuing, or causing MetLife, Inc. to issue, materially false and misleading statements and/or omissions concerning MetLife, Inc. s potential liability for millions of dollars in insurance benefits that should have been paid to beneficiaries or escheated to the states. Plaintiff seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. On October 14, 2015, the court denied the defendants  motion to dismiss the complaint. On October 28, 2016, the parties signed a stipulation of settlement agreeing to resolve this action. Plaintiff is seeking court approval of this settlement. 
  Total Control Accounts Litigation 
  Owens v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (N.D. Ga., filed April 17, 2014)  
  Plaintiff filed this putative class action lawsuit on behalf of all persons for whom MLIC established a retained asset account, known as a TCA, to pay death benefits under an Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ( ERISA ) plan. The action alleges that MLIC s use of the TCA as the settlement option for life insurance benefits under some group life insurance policies violates MLIC s fiduciary duties under ERISA. As damages, plaintiff seeks disgorgement of profits that MLIC realized on accounts owned by members of the putative class. On September 27, 2016, the court denied MLIC s summary judgment motion in full and granted plaintiff s partial summary judgment motion. The Company intends to defend this action vigorously.  
  Reinsurance Litigation 
  Robainas, et al. v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (S.D.N.Y., December 16, 2014) 
  Plaintiffs filed this putative class action lawsuit on behalf of themselves and all persons and entities who, directly or indirectly, purchased, renewed or paid premiums on life insurance policies issued by MLIC from 2009 through 2014 (the  Policies ). Two similar actions were subsequently filed,     Yale v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. (S.D.N.Y., January 12, 2015)   and   International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District Lodge 15 v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. (E.D.N.Y., February 2, 2015)  . Both of these actions were consolidated with the Robainas action. The consolidated complaint alleges that MLIC inadequately disclosed in its statutory annual statements that certain reinsurance transactions with affiliated reinsurance companies were collateralized using  contractual parental guarantees,  and thereby allegedly misrepresented its financial condition and the adequacy of its reserves. The lawsuit sought recovery under Section 4226 of the New York Insurance Law of a statutory penalty in the amount of the premiums paid for the Policies. On October 9, 2015, the court granted MLIC s motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint, finding that plaintiffs lacked Article III standing because they did not allege any concrete injury as a result of the alleged conduct. Plaintiffs appealed this decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. 
  Intoccia v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (S.D.N.Y., April 20, 2015) 
  Plaintiffs filed this putative class action on behalf of themselves and all persons and entities who, directly or indirectly, purchased, renewed or paid premiums for Guaranteed Benefits Insurance Riders attached to variable annuity contracts with MLIC from 2009 through 2015 (the  Annuities ). The court consolidated     Weilert v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.   (S.D.N.Y., April 30, 2015) with the     Intoccia     case, and the consolidated, amended complaint alleges that MLIC inadequately disclosed in its statutory annual statements that certain reinsurance transactions with affiliated reinsurance companies were collateralized using  contractual parental guarantees,  and thereby allegedly misrepresented its financial condition and the adequacy of its reserves. The lawsuits seek recovery under Section 4226 of the New York Insurance Law of a statutory penalty in the amount of the premiums paid for Guaranteed Benefits Insurance Riders attached to the Annuities. The Court granted MLIC s motion to dismiss, adopting the reasoning of the     Robainas   decision  . Plaintiffs appealed this decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.

Diversified Lending Group Litigations 
  Hartshorne v. MetLife Inc., et al. (Los Angeles County Superior Court, filed March 25, 2015) 
  Plaintiffs have named MetLife, Inc., MSI and NELICO in 12 related lawsuits in California state court alleging various causes of action including multiple negligence and statutory claims relating to a Ponzi scheme involving the Diversified Lending Group ( DLG ). In August 2016, a trial of claims by one of the plaintiffs, Christine Ramirez, resulted in a verdict against MetLife, Inc., MSI, and NELICO for approximately   $200 thousand   in compensatory damages and   $15 million   in punitive damages. The Company intends to appeal this verdict. 
  Other Litigation  
  McGuire v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (E.D. Mich., filed February 22, 2012) 
  The fiduciary for the Union Carbide Employees  Pension Plan alleged that MLIC, which issued annuity contracts to fund some of the benefits the Plan provides, engaged in transactions that ERISA prohibits and violated duties under ERISA and federal common law by determining that no dividends were payable with respect to the contracts from and after 1999. The parties have resolved this matter, and the court has dismissed the action. 
  Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada Indemnity Claim 
  In 2006, Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada ( Sun Life ), as successor to the purchaser of MLIC s Canadian operations, filed a lawsuit in Toronto, seeking a declaration that MLIC remains liable for  market conduct claims  related to certain individual life insurance policies sold by MLIC that were subsequently transferred to Sun Life. In January 2010, the court found that Sun Life had given timely notice of its claim for indemnification but, because it found that Sun Life had not yet incurred an indemnifiable loss, granted MLIC s motion for summary judgment. Both parties agreed to consider the indemnity claim through arbitration. In September 2010, Sun Life notified MLIC that a purported class action lawsuit was filed against Sun Life in Toronto alleging sales practices claims regarding the policies sold by MLIC and transferred to Sun Life. On August 30, 2011, Sun Life notified MLIC that another purported class action lawsuit was filed against Sun Life in Vancouver, BC alleging sales practices claims regarding certain of the same policies sold by MLIC and transferred to Sun Life. Sun Life contends that MLIC is obligated to indemnify Sun Life for some or all of the claims in these lawsuits. These sales practices cases against Sun Life are ongoing, and the Company is unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss arising from this litigation. 
  Fauley v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, et al. (Circuit Court of the 19th Judicial Circuit, Lake County, Ill., July 3, 2014) 
  Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit against defendants, including MLIC and a former MetLife financial services representative, alleging that the defendants sent unsolicited fax advertisements to plaintiff and others in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, as amended by the Junk Fax Prevention Act, 47 U.S.C.   227. The court issued a final order certifying a nationwide settlement class and approving a settlement under which MLIC has agreed to pay up to   $23 million   to resolve claims as to fax advertisements sent between August 23, 2008 and August 7, 2014. On March 23, 2016, the intermediate appellate court affirmed the trial court s order. On September 28, 2016, the Illinois Supreme Court denied an objector s petition for leave to appeal. 
  MetLife, Inc. v. Financial Stability Oversight Council (D. D.C., January 13, 2015) 
  MetLife, Inc. filed this action in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ( D.C. District Court ) seeking to overturn the Financial Stability Oversight Council s ( FSOC ) designation of MetLife, Inc. as a non-bank systemically important financial institution ( non-bank SIFI ). The suit is brought under the section of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act providing that a company designated as a non-bank SIFI may petition the federal courts for review, and seeks an order requiring that the final determination be rescinded. The D.C. District Court issued a decision on March 30, 2016 granting, in part, MetLife, Inc. s cross motion for summary judgment and rescinding the FSOC s designation of MetLife, Inc. as a non-bank SIFI. On April 8, 2016, the FSOC appealed the D.C. District Court s order to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.

Voshall v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, April 8, 2015) 
  Plaintiff filed this putative class action lawsuit on behalf of himself and all persons covered under a long-term group disability income insurance policy issued by MLIC to public entities in California between April 8, 2011 and April 8, 2015. Plaintiff alleges that MLIC improperly reduced benefits by including cost of living adjustments and employee paid contributions in the employer retirement benefits and other income that reduces the benefit payable under such policies. Plaintiff asserts causes of action for declaratory relief, violation of the California Business   Professions Code, breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The Company intends to defend this action vigorously. 
  Martin v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, (Superior Court of the State of California, County of Contra Costa, filed December 17, 2015) 
  Plaintiffs filed this putative class action lawsuit on behalf of themselves and all California persons who have been charged compound interest by MLIC in life insurance policy and/or premium loan balances within the last four years. Plaintiffs allege that MLIC has engaged in a pattern and practice of charging compound interest on life insurance policy and premium loans without the borrower authorizing such compounding, and that this constitutes an unlawful business practice under California law. Plaintiff asserts causes of action for declaratory relief, violation of California s Unfair Competition Law and Usury Law, and unjust enrichment. Plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, restitution of interest, and damages in an unspecified amount. On April 12, 2016, the court granted MLIC s motion to dismiss. Plaintiffs have filed a notice appealing this ruling. 
  Lau v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (S.D.N.Y. filed, December 3, 2015) 
  This putative class action lawsuit was filed by a single defined contribution plan participant on behalf of all ERISA plans whose assets were invested in MetLife s  Group Annuity Contract Stable Value Funds  within the past six years. The suit alleges breaches of fiduciary duty under ERISA and challenges the  spread  with respect to the stable value fund group annuity products sold to retirement plans. The allegations focus on the methodology MetLife uses to establish and reset the crediting rate, the terms under which plan participants are permitted to transfer funds from a stable value option to another investment option, the procedures followed if an employer terminates a contract, and the level of disclosure provided. Plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as damages in an unspecified amount. The Company intends to defend this action vigorously. 
  Newman v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (N.D. Ill., filed March 23, 2016) 
  Plaintiff filed this putative class action alleging causes of action for breach of contract, fraud, and violations of the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, based on MLIC s class-wide increase in premiums charged for long-term care insurance policies. Plaintiff alleges a class consisting of herself and all persons over age 65 who selected a Reduced Pay at Age 65 payment feature and whose premium rates were increased after age 65. Plaintiff asserts that premiums could not be increased for these class members and/or that marketing material was misleading as to MLIC s right to increase premiums. Plaintiff seeks unspecified compensatory, statutory and punitive damages as well as recessionary and injunctive relief. The Company intends to defend this action vigorously.  
  Thrivent Financial for Lutherans v. MetLife Insurance Company USA, (E.D. Wis., filed September 12, 2016) 
  Plaintiff filed a complaint against MetLife USA contending that MetLife s use of the Brighthouse Financial trademark and logo will infringe on its trademarks. Alleging violations of federal and state law, plaintiff seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, compensatory damages, and other relief. MetLife USA intends to defend this action vigorously. 
  Sales Practices Claims 
  Over the past several years, the Company has faced numerous claims, including class action lawsuits, alleging improper marketing or sales of individual life insurance policies, annuities, mutual funds, other products or the misuse of client assets. Some of the current cases seek substantial damages, including punitive and treble damages and attorneys  fees. The Company continues to defend vigorously against the claims in these matters. The Company believes adequate provision has been made in its consolidated financial statements for all probable and reasonably estimable losses for sales practices matters.

Summary 
  Putative or certified class action litigation and other litigation and claims and assessments against the Company, in addition to those discussed previously and those otherwise provided for in the Company s consolidated financial statements, have arisen in the course of the Company s business, including, but not limited to, in connection with its activities as an insurer, mortgage lending bank, employer, investor, investment advisor and taxpayer. Further, state insurance regulatory authorities and other federal and state authorities regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations concerning the Company s compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and regulations. 
  It is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of all pending investigations and legal proceedings. In some of the matters referred to previously, very large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages, are sought. Although in light of these considerations it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a material effect upon the Company s financial position, based on information currently known by the Company s management, in its opinion, the outcomes of such pending investigations and legal proceedings are not likely to have such an effect. However, given the large and/or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material effect on the Company s consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods. 
   
  Commitments 
  Mortgage Loan Commitments 
  The Company commits to lend funds under mortgage loan commitments. The amounts of these mortgage loan commitments were   $4.0 billion   and   $4.4 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Commitments to Fund Partnership Investments, Bank Credit Facilities, Bridge Loans and Private Corporate Bond Investments 
  The Company commits to fund partnership investments and to lend funds under bank credit facilities, bridge loans and private corporate bond investments. The amounts of these unfunded commitments were   $8.6 billion   and   $7.1 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
   
  Guarantees 
  In the normal course of its business, the Company has provided certain indemnities, guarantees and commitments to third parties such that it may be required to make payments now or in the future. In the context of acquisition, disposition, investment and other transactions, the Company has provided indemnities and guarantees, including those related to tax, environmental and other specific liabilities and other indemnities and guarantees that are triggered by, among other things, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by the Company. In addition, in the normal course of business, the Company provides indemnifications to counterparties in contracts with triggers similar to the foregoing, as well as for certain other liabilities, such as third-party lawsuits. These obligations are often subject to time limitations that vary in duration, including contractual limitations and those that arise by operation of law, such as applicable statutes of limitation. In some cases, the maximum potential obligation under the indemnities and guarantees is subject to a contractual limitation ranging from less than   $1 million   to   $329 million  , with a cumulative maximum of   $1.2 billion  , while in other cases such limitations are not specified or applicable. Since certain of these obligations are not subject to limitations, the Company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that could become due under these guarantees in the future. Management believes that it is unlikely the Company will have to make any material payments under these indemnities, guarantees, or commitments. 
  In addition, the Company indemnifies its directors and officers as provided in its charters and by-laws. Also, the Company indemnifies its agents for liabilities incurred as a result of their representation of the Company s interests. Since these indemnities are generally not subject to limitation with respect to duration or amount, the Company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that could become due under these indemnities in the future. 
  The Company has also minimum fund yield requirements on certain international pension funds in accordance with local laws. Since these guarantees are not subject to limitation with respect to duration or amount, the Company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that could become due under these guarantees in the future. 
  The Company s recorded liabilities were   $9 million   and   $8 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, for indemnities, guarantees and commitments.

Forward-Looking Statements and Other Financial Information 
  For purposes of this discussion,  MetLife,  the  Company,   we,   our  and  us  refer to MetLife, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1999, its subsidiaries and affiliates. Following this summary is a discussion addressing the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the Company for the periods indicated. This discussion should be read in conjunction with MetLife, Inc. s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (the  2015 Annual Report ), the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements included below, the  Risk Factors  set forth in Part II, Item 1A, and the additional risk factors referred to therein,  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  and the Company s interim condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. 
  This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations may contain or incorporate by reference information that includes or is based upon forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements give expectations or forecasts of future events. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as  anticipate,   estimate,   expect,   project,   intend,   plan,   believe  and other words and terms of similar meaning, or are tied to future periods, in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective services or products, future performance or results of current and anticipated services or products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, trends in operations and financial results. Any or all forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. See  Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.  
  This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes references to our performance measures, operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders, that are not based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). These measures are used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, operating earnings is also our GAAP measure of segment performance. Operating earnings and other financial measures based on operating earnings are also the measures by which senior management s and many other employees  performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans.   Operating earnings and other financial measures based on operating earnings allow analysis of our performance relative to our business plan and facilitate comparisons to industry results.   Forward-looking guidance provided on a non-GAAP basis cannot be reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis because net income may fluctuate significantly if net investment gains and losses and net derivative gains and losses move outside of estimated ranges. See        Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures  for definitions and a discussion of these measures, and        Results of Operations  for reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.  
   
  Executive Summary 
   
  Overview 
  MetLife is a global provider of life insurance, annuities, employee benefits and asset management. In anticipation of the Company s plan to separate a substantial portion of its former Retail segment, as well as certain portions of its former Corporate Benefit Funding segment and Corporate   Other (the  Separation ), in the third quarter of 2016, MetLife reorganized its businesses into six segments: U.S.; Asia; Latin America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa ( EMEA  MetLife Holdings; and Brighthouse Financial. In addition, the Company reports certain of its results of operations in Corporate   Other. See    Other Key Information   Segment Information  and Note   2   of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company s segments and Corporate   Other. See also    Other Key Information   Significant Events  for information on the Separation. Management continues to evaluate the Company s segment performance and allocated resources and may adjust related measurements in the future to better reflect segment profitability. 
  Current Period Highlights 
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, overall sales growth increased as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 as we experienced sales growth across certain products within our segments. In addition, positive net flows drove an increase in our investment portfolio. Our results for the quarter reflect   a write-off of deferred policy acquisition costs ( DAC ) and an increase in our insurance-related liabilities due to loss recognition testing upon re-segmentation, as well as charges related to a goodwill impairment  .

Consolidated Company Outlook  
  As part of an enterprise-wide strategic initiative, we announced that, by 2016, we expected to increase our operating return on common stockholders  equity ( operating ROE ), excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) other than foreign currency translation adjustments ( FCTA ), driven by higher operating earnings. In 2016, we expect our operating ROE, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, to be lower than 11% due to unfavorable market factors, our current year reserve adjustments from modeling improvements and the effect of our annual variable annuity actuarial assumption review, as well as the activities associated with the proposed Separation of our U.S. retail business. 
  We believe that many of MetLife s financial and business characteristics following the Separation will shift favorably and may be reflected in several important metrics, including an improvement in our operating ROE after the costs of the Separation are eliminated. 
  When making projections, we must rely on the accuracy of our assumptions about future economic and business conditions, which can be affected by known and unknown risks and other uncertainties. Our assumptions have been and will continue to be impacted by (i) MetLife, Inc. s plan to pursue the Separation, (ii) regulatory uncertainty regarding capital requirements that would have been applicable to us as a result of the Financial Stability Oversight Council s ( FSOC ) former designation of MetLife, Inc. as a non-bank systemically important financial institution ( non-bank SIFI ), which, among other things, impacted the level of our share repurchases, (iii) lower investment margins (primarily in the U.S.) as a result of the sustained low interest rate environment, (iv) lower than anticipated merger and acquisition activity, and (v) the impact on our foreign operations of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. See    Other Key Information   Significant Events  for information regarding the Separation, the sale to Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company ( MassMutual ) of MetLife s U.S. retail advisor force and certain assets associated with the MetLife Premier Client Group, including all of the issued and outstanding shares of MetLife s affiliated broker-dealer, MetLife Securities, Inc. ( MSI ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. (the  U.S. Retail Advisor Force Divestiture ), and the determination by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ( D.C. District Court ) on March 30, 2016 to rescind the FSOC s designation of MetLife, Inc. as a non-bank SIFI. 
  We have engaged and expect to continue to engage in a number of Separation-related transactions that will impact our holding companies  liquid assets. Further, we have increased and expect to continue to increase our holding companies  liquid assets over time as a result of (i) $291 million in cash proceeds that we received from the U.S. Retail Advisor Force Divestiture; (ii) dividends in the range of $3.3 billion to $3.8 billion that we expect to receive from Brighthouse (which may be partially funded by the issuance of debt by Brighthouse) and a MetLife-affiliated reinsurance company prior to the Separation; and (iii) proceeds from the disposition of our retained shares of Brighthouse common stock that we expect to receive over time. We expect our holding companies  liquid assets to decrease in the second half of 2016 as a result of Separation-related items of approximately $1.5 billion consisting of foregone dividends, foregone incremental debt, and expenses to be incurred to effectuate the Separation. In addition to these Separation-related items, we expect to have cash commitments of between $1.0 billion and $2.0 billion over the two-year period of 2017 and 2018 relating to liability management transactions, including the repayment of certain debt maturities. Following the Separation, we plan to maintain a liquidity buffer of $3.0 to $4.0 billion of liquid assets at the holding companies. 
  Excluding the impact of the above Separation-related items occurring in 2016, we anticipate that our ratio of free cash flow to operating earnings, adjusting for notable items, for the year ended December 31, 2016 will be at or above the high end of a range of 55% to 65%. We expect the average ratio of free cash flow to operating earnings over the two-year period of 2017 and 2018, excluding the impact of the Separation, to be 65% to 75%. This expectation reflects our unit cost improvement program announced earlier this year and the related initiative to invest $1 billion by 2020 to generate $800 million pre-tax run rate annual savings, net of stranded overhead. It also assumes interest rates follow the observable forward yield curves as of August 30, 2016. We expect Separation-related events to occur in both 2016 and 2017 and, accordingly, we may adjust free cash flow in both years for such notable items. We believe that free cash flow is the key determinant of dividends and share repurchases.

Other Key Information 
  Basis of Presentation 
  Prior to January 1, 2016, certain international subsidiaries had a fiscal year cutoff of November 30th. Accordingly, the Company s interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the assets and liabilities of such subsidiaries as of November 30, 2015 and the operating results of such subsidiaries for the three months and nine months ended August 31, 2015. Effective January 1, 2016, the Company converted its Japan operations to calendar year-end reporting. The elimination of a one-month reporting lag of a subsidiary is considered a change in accounting principle and requires retrospective application. While the Company believes that eliminating the lag in the reporting of its Japan operations was preferable in order to consistently reflect events, economic conditions and global trends in the financial statements, the Company determined that it was impracticable to apply the effects of the lag elimination to financial reporting periods prior to January 1, 2015. The effect of not retroactively applying this change in accounting, however, was not material to the 2015 or 2016 consolidated financial statements. Therefore, the Company reported the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle in net income for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and did not retrospectively apply the effects of this change to prior periods. See Note   2   of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Segment Information 
  Based on the proposed Separation, in the third quarter of 2016, the Company reorganized its businesses as follows: 
             
    The businesses the Company plans to separate and include in Brighthouse Financial are reflected in a new segment, Brighthouse Financial.  
                
    The businesses formerly in the Retail segment, but that the Company does not plan to include in the Brighthouse Financial segment, are reflected in a new segment, MetLife Holdings. This segment also includes the long-term care business, formerly reported as part of the Group, Voluntary   Worksite Benefit ( GVWB ) segment, and the reinsurance treaty relating to the former Japan joint venture, previously reported in Corporate   Other.  
                
    The Property   Casualty business, the Retirement   Income Solutions business (which represents most of the segment formerly known as Corporate Benefit Funding), and the Group Benefits business (consisting of the remaining components of the GVWB business, including the individual disability insurance business previously reported in the former Retail segment), are reflected in a new segment, U.S. 
                
    The U.S. Direct business, previously reported as part of the Latin America segment, has been disaggregated and reported in the new U.S. segment and in Corporate   Other. 
                
    The Asia and EMEA segments remain unchanged. 
     These changes were applied retrospectively and did not have an impact on total consolidated net income or operating earnings in the prior periods. See Note   2   of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company s segments. 
  This re-segmentation resulted in a $296 million, net of income tax, charge to earnings in the current period, all in the Brighthouse Financial segment, driven by the segment s variable and universal life products. This charge is the direct result of the Company, beginning in the third quarter, no longer being able to aggregate, for loss recognition testing, the variable and universal life products of Brighthouse Financial with the variable and universal life products remaining with MetLife Holdings. Of this amount, the Company recorded $254 million, net of income tax, as a one-time charge, which was mostly recognized as a write-off of DAC, with the remaining $42 million, net of income tax, recognized as an increase in insurance-related liabilities. The ongoing impact to Brighthouse Financial from the loss of aggregation benefit is expected to be approximately $40 million, net of income tax, per quarter, gradually declining over time.  
  Significant Events 
  In July 2016, MetLife, Inc. completed the U.S. Retail Advisor Force Divestiture for   $291 million  .   MassMutual assumed all of the liabilities related to such assets that arise or occur at or after the closing of the sale. As part of the transactions, MetLife, Inc. and MassMutual entered into a product development agreement under which MetLife s U.S. retail business will be the exclusive developer of certain annuity products to be issued by MassMutual. In the MassMutual purchase agreement, MetLife, Inc. agreed to indemnify MassMutual for certain claims, liabilities and breaches of representations and warranties up to limits described in the purchase agreement. See Note   3   of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

On December 18, 2014, the FSOC designated MetLife, Inc. as a non-bank SIFI subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the  Federal Reserve Board ) and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (collectively with the Federal Reserve Board, the  Federal Reserve ) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the  FDIC ), as well as to enhanced supervision and prudential standards. On March 30, 2016, the D.C. District Court ordered that the designation of MetLife, Inc. as a non-bank SIFI by the FSOC be rescinded. On April 8, 2016, the FSOC appealed the D.C. District Court s order to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. If the FSOC prevails on appeal or designates MetLife, Inc. as systemically important as part of its ongoing review of non-bank financial companies, MetLife, Inc. could once again be subject to regulation as a non-bank SIFI. See  Business   U.S. Regulation   Regulation as a Non-Bank SIFI  in the 2015 Annual Report, as amended or supplemented in our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q under the caption  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations       Industry Trends       Regulatory Developments  and similarly named sections under the caption  Risk Factors.  
  On January 12, 2016, MetLife, Inc. announced its plan to pursue the Separation. Additionally, on July 21, 2016, MetLife, Inc. announced that, following the Separation, the separated business will be rebranded as  Brighthouse Financial.  On October 5, 2016, Brighthouse Financial, Inc., a subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. ( Brighthouse ), filed a registration statement on Form 10 (the  Form 10 ) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). The information statement filed as an exhibit to the Form 10 disclosed that the Company intends to include MetLife Insurance Company USA ( MetLife USA ), New England Life Insurance Company ( NELICO ), First MetLife Investors Insurance Company, MetLife Advisers, LLC and certain captive reinsurance companies in the proposed separated business and distribute at least 80.1% of the shares of Brighthouse s common stock on a     pro rata     basis to the holders of MetLife, Inc. common stock. The ultimate form and timing of the Separation will be influenced by a number of factors, including regulatory considerations and economic conditions. MetLife continues to evaluate and pursue structural alternatives for the proposed Separation. MetLife expects that the life insurance closed block and the life and annuity business sold through MLIC will not be a part of Brighthouse Financial. The Separation remains subject to certain conditions including, among others, obtaining final approval from the MetLife, Inc. Board of Directors, receipt of a favorable ruling from the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) and an opinion from MetLife s tax advisor regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters, and an SEC declaration of the effectiveness of the Form 10. 
   
  Industry Trends  
  The following information on industry trends should be read in conjunction with  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Industry Trends  in Part II, Item 7, of the   2015   Annual Report. 
  We continue to be impacted by the unstable global financial and economic environment that has been affecting the industry. 
   
  Financial and Economic Environment 
  Our business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally. Stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in global capital markets, particular markets, or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on us, in part because we have a large investment portfolio and our insurance liabilities are sensitive to changing market factors.  
  Weakness in the energy and metals and mining sectors and concerns about the political and/or economic stability in the U.K., Brazil, Turkey, Russia, Ukraine, China, Japan, the Middle East and Puerto Rico, as well as Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain ( Europe s perimeter region ) and Cyprus have contributed to global market volatility. See    Investments   Current Environment   Selected Country and Sector Investments.  Events following the U.K. s referendum on June 23, 2016 and the uncertainties associated with its pending withdrawal from the European Union ( EU ) have also contributed to market volatility. The risk of market volatility may spread beyond the U.K. and the uncertainties associated with its pending withdrawal from the EU could be intensified by foreign exchange risks. These factors could contribute to weakening gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth, primarily in the U.K. and Europe. The magnitude and longevity of the potential negative economic impacts would depend on the detailed agreements reached by the U.K. and the EU as a result of the exit negotiations and negotiations regarding trade and other arrangements.

Concerns about global economic conditions, capital markets and the solvency of certain EU member states, including Europe s perimeter region, their banking systems and the financial institutions that have significant direct or indirect exposure to debt issued by these countries or their respective banking systems, have also been a cause of elevated levels of market volatility. See    Investments   Current Environment  for information regarding our exposure to obligations of European governments, European private obligors and Europe s perimeter region. Contributing to such volatility are concerns that such countries could default on their obligations, have to restructure their outstanding debt, or that financial institutions with significant holdings of sovereign or private debt of such countries, including Europe s perimeter region, could experience financial stress, any of which could have significant adverse effects on the European and global economies and on financial markets, generally. While economic conditions in certain of these countries, including Europe s perimeter region, seem to be stabilizing or improving, there is still concern that any support measures, including those made by the European Central Bank ( ECB ) to lessen the risk of deflation, lower borrowing costs in the Euro zone and encourage corporations to issue more asset-backed securities, could affect the Euro exchange rate and have uncertain impacts on interest rates and risk markets. See  Risk Factors   Economic Environment and Capital Markets-Related Risks   We Are Exposed to Significant Global Financial and Capital Markets Risks Which May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity, and May Cause Our Net Investment Income to Vary from Period to Period,  and  Risk Factors   Economic Environment and Capital Markets-Related Risks   If Difficult Conditions in the Global Capital Markets and the Economy Generally Persist, They May Materially Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations  in the 2015 Annual Report, as amended or supplemented in our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q in similarly named sections under the caption  Risk Factors.  
  We face substantial exposure to the Japanese economy given our operations there. Structural weaknesses and debt sustainability have yet to be addressed effectively. Going forward, Japan s structural and demographic challenges may continue to limit its potential growth unless reforms that boost productivity are put into place. Japan s high public sector debt levels are mitigated by low refinancing risks and its nominal yields on government debt have remained at a lower level than that of any other developed country. However, frequent changes in government have prevented policy makers from implementing fiscal reform measures to put public finances on a sustainable path. To avert deflation and to achieve sustainable economic growth, the government and the Bank of Japan have implemented a coordinated strategy which includes the imposition of a negative rate on commercial bank deposits, continued government bond purchases and tax reform, including the lowering of the Japanese corporate tax rate and the delay until 2019 of an increase in the consumption tax to 10%. As a result of the decrease in the corporate tax rate, the Company recorded a one-time benefit of $174 million in the second quarter of 2015, which included an increase in Asia s operating earnings of $61 million. 
   
  Impact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment 
  As a global insurance company, we are affected by the monetary policy of central banks around the world, as well as the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve Board in the United States. The Federal Reserve Board has taken a number of actions in recent years to spur economic activity, including asset purchases and keeping interest rates low. However, in December 2015, the Federal Reserve Board s Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) increased the federal funds rate for the first time in 10 years and has held it steady since then. Further increases in the federal funds rate in the future may affect interest rates and risk markets in the U.S. and other developed and emerging economies. See    Financial and Economic Environment  for information regarding accommodative and other policy measures pursued by the ECB and the Bank of Japan. However, we cannot predict with certainty the effect of these programs and policies on interest rates or the impact on the pricing levels of risk-bearing investments at this time. See    Investments   Current Environment.  
  During periods of declining interest rates, we may have to invest insurance cash flows and reinvest the cash flows we received as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower yielding instruments. Moreover, borrowers may prepay or redeem the fixed income securities, commercial, agricultural or residential mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities in our investment portfolio with greater frequency in order to borrow at lower market rates. Therefore, some of our products expose us to the risk that a reduction in interest rates will reduce the difference between the amounts that we are required to credit on contracts in our general account and the rate of return we are able to earn on investments intended to support obligations under these contracts. This difference between interest earned and interest credited, or margin, is a key metric for the management of, and reporting for, many of our businesses. 
  Our expectations regarding future margins are an important component impacting the amortization of certain intangible assets such as DAC and value of business acquired ( VOBA ). Significantly lower margins may cause us to accelerate the amortization, thereby reducing net income in the affected reporting period. Additionally, lower margins may also impact the recoverability of intangible assets such as goodwill, require the establishment of additional liabilities or trigger loss recognition events on certain policyholder liabilities. We review this long-term margin assumption, along with other assumptions, as part of our annual assumption review.

Competitive Pressures 
  The life insurance industry remains highly competitive. The product development and product life cycles have shortened in many product segments, leading to more intense competition with respect to product features. Larger companies have the ability to invest in brand equity, product development, technology and risk management, which are among the fundamentals for sustained profitable growth in the life insurance industry. In addition, several of the industry s products can be quite homogeneous and subject to intense price competition. Sufficient scale, financial strength and financial flexibility are becoming prerequisites for sustainable growth in the life insurance industry. Larger market participants tend to have the capacity to invest in additional distribution capability and the information technology needed to offer the superior customer service demanded by an increasingly sophisticated industry client base. We believe that the continued volatility of the financial markets, its impact on the capital position of many competitors, and subsequent actions by regulators and rating agencies have altered the competitive environment. In particular, we believe that these factors have highlighted financial strength as the most significant differentiator from the perspective of some customers and certain distributors. We believe the Company is well positioned to compete in this environment. 
   
  Regulatory Developments 
  In the U.S., our life insurance companies are regulated primarily at the state level, with some products and services also subject to federal regulation. In addition, MetLife, Inc. and its U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the insurance holding company laws of various U.S. jurisdictions. Furthermore, some of MetLife s operations, products and services are subject to consumer protection laws, securities, broker-dealer and investment adviser regulations, environmental and unclaimed property laws and regulations, and to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ( ERISA ). If MetLife, Inc. were re-designated as a non-bank SIFI, it could also be subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. See    U.S. Regulation  below, as well as  Business   Regulation   U.S. Regulation,   Risk Factors   Regulatory and Legal Risks   Our Insurance and Brokerage Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth,   Risk Factors   Risks Related to Our Business   Our Statutory Life Insurance Reserve Financings May Be Subject to Cost Increases and New Financings May Be Subject to Limited Market Capacity,  and  Risk Factors   Regulatory and Legal Risks   Changes in U.S. Federal, State Securities and State Insurance Laws and Regulations May Affect Our Operations and Our Profitability  included in the 2015 Annual Report, as amended or supplemented in our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q under the caption  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Industry Trends   Regulatory Developments  and similarly named sections under the caption  Risk Factors.   
  Our international insurance operations are principally regulated by insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are located or operate. In addition, our investment and pension companies outside of the U.S. are subject to oversight by the relevant securities, pension and other authorities of the countries in which the companies operate. Our non-U.S. insurance businesses are also subject to current and developing solvency regimes which impose various capital and other requirements. As a global systemically important insurer ( G-SII ), MetLife, Inc. may also become subject to additional capital requirements. See    International Regulation  below, as well as  Business   Regulation   International Regulation  included in the 2015 Annual Report, as amended or supplemented in our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q under the caption  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Industry Trends   Regulatory Developments.

  Insurance Regulatory Examinations and Other Activities 
  The International Association of Insurance Supervisors ( IAIS ) has encouraged U.S. insurance supervisors, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services ( NYDFS ), to establish Supervisory Colleges for U.S.-based insurance groups with international operations, including MetLife, to facilitate cooperation and coordination among the insurance groups  supervisors and to enhance the member regulators  understanding of an insurance group s risk profile. A September 2016 Supervisory College was chaired by the NYDFS and attended by MetLife s key U.S. and international regulators. We have not received any reports or recommendations from the Supervisory College meeting, and we do not expect any outcome of the meeting to have a material adverse effect on our business.  
   
  New York s Proposed Cybersecurity Regulation 
  Since late 2015, the NYDFS has been considering a potential cybersecurity regulation for those banking and insurance entities under its jurisdiction. On September 13, 2016, the NYDFS released a proposed regulation for a 45-day comment period. The proposed regulation would require any person operating under a license or similar authorization under the New York banking, insurance or financial services law to establish a cybersecurity program meeting certain core functions, adopt a cybersecurity policy, appoint a Chief Information Security Officer, and oversee the cybersecurity practices of third-party service providers, among other requirements. 
   
  ERISA Considerations 
  The Department of Labor ( DOL ) issued new regulations on April 6, 2016 with an effective date for most provisions of April 10, 2017. These regulations substantially expand the definition of  investment advice  and thereby broaden the circumstances under which MetLife or its representatives, in providing investment advice with respect to ERISA plans, plan participants or Individual Retirement Accounts or Annuities ( IRAs ), will be deemed a fiduciary under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ). Pursuant to the final regulations, certain communications with plans, plan participants and IRA holders, including the marketing of products, and marketing of investment management or advisory services, could be deemed fiduciary investment advice, thus, causing increased exposure to fiduciary liability if the distributor does not recommend what is in the client s best interests. The DOL also issued amendments to certain of its prohibited transaction exemptions, and issued a new exemption, that applies more onerous disclosure and contract requirements to, and increases fiduciary requirements and fiduciary liability exposure in respect of, transactions involving ERISA plans, plan participants and IRAs. On September 27, 2016, the DOL released Frequently Asked Questions on the new exemption and amendments to certain existing exemptions, which provide guidance concerning the application and implementation of the new and amended prohibited transaction exemptions. 
  We anticipate that we will need to undertake certain additional tasks in order to comply with certain of the exemptions provided in the DOL regulations, including additional compliance reviews of material shared with distributors, wholesaler and call center training and product reporting and analysis. See  Risk Factors       Regulatory and Legal Risks       Our Insurance and Brokerage Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and In Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth.   
  On July 11, 2016, the DOL, the IRS and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation proposed revisions to the Form 5500, the form used for ERISA annual reporting. The revisions affect employee pension and welfare benefit plans, including our ERISA plans, and require audits of information, self-directed brokerage account disclosure and additional extensive disclosure. We cannot predict the effect these proposals will have on our business, if enacted, or what other proposals may be made, what legislation may be introduced or enacted, or what impact any such legislation may have on our results of operations and financial condition.

On June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum regarding its membership in the EU, resulting in a narrow vote in favor of leaving the EU. The U.K. subsequently indicated that it will initiate the withdrawal process by the end of March 2017. The member withdrawal provisions in the applicable EU treaty have not been used before so it is unclear how the provisions will work in practice. Assuming the U.K. initiates the withdrawal process by giving notice that it is withdrawing from the EU, the relevant treaty provides that the U.K. and the EU will negotiate a withdrawal agreement during a maximum two-year period (unless such period is extended by unanimous vote of the other EU member states). It is currently anticipated that the withdrawal agreement would deal with the details of the immediate exit but would not set out final trade arrangements or deal comprehensively with other potentially significant matters. Upon effectiveness of the withdrawal agreement, or, if no agreement is concluded in the two-year period, at the end of the period, the U.K. will no longer be a member of the EU. In the meantime, however, the U.K. remains a member of the EU with unchanged rights to access the single EU market in goods and services. Our U.K. business model utilizes certain rights to operate cross-border insurance and investment operations which may be modified or eliminated as a result of the U.K. exiting the EU. Operating expenses within our businesses could increase as a result of uncertainties during the negotiation period and in the event of an eventual U.K. withdrawal.  
  Other changes in the laws and regulations of jurisdictions that affect our customers and independent sales intermediaries or their operations also may affect our business relationships with them and their ability to purchase or distribute our products. Such actions may negatively affect our business in these jurisdictions. The Polish Ministry of Economic Development recently proposed the transfer of certain pension fund assets to the government, the creation of private individual retirement accounts using certain other pension fund assets, and the implementation of additional pension plan options intended to boost savings and long-term investment. It is premature to predict the impact that such measures, if implemented, would have on our business in Poland. In Chile, in September 2015, a Presidential Advisory Committee issued several recommendations to reform the pension system. On August 9, 2016, Chilean President Bachelet proposed further changes to the pension system, including the (i) creation of a state-owned pension fund which may have the benefit of certain exceptions unavailable to private pension funds, (ii) implementation of a competitive bidding process for existing customers, which could result in loss of such customers to funds with lower commissions, and (iii) obligation for pension funds to refund commissions in the event of negative returns, which could, in turn, cause fund managers to invest in instruments which have lower volatility, but lower returns. These proposals, if enacted, may have a significant adverse effect on our business in Chile. The committee issued a series of recommendations in September 2015, but the reform proposal has not been finalized and may still change further if a bill results from their recommendations. It is premature to predict the impact of such reforms on our pension business in Chile. On July 21, 2016, the Chilean Pension Funds Superintendency instituted a proceeding to consider the validity of the action taken by the Superintendency in 2015 approving the merger of Administradora de Fondos de Pensiones ProVida, S.A. into a subsidiary of MetLife, Inc., which was effective on September 1, 2015. It is premature to predict the outcome of the proceedings and its potential impact on our pension business in Chile.   
  The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, along with European legislation, requires European regulators, such as the Central Bank of Ireland ( CBI ), to establish Supervisory Colleges for European Economic Area-based insurance groups with significant European operations, including MetLife, to facilitate cooperation and coordination among the insurance groups  European supervisors and to enhance the member regulators  understanding of an insurance group s risk profile. An October 2016 Supervisory College was chaired by the CBI and was attended by MetLife s key European regulators. We have not received any reports or recommendations from the Supervisory College meeting, and we do not expect the outcome of the meeting to have a material adverse effect on our business. 
   
  Solvency Regimes 
  Other Solvency Regimes 
  Mexico adopted a reform of its Insurance Law in February 2013. In accordance with this reform, a Solvency II-type regulatory framework became effective on January 1, 2016 which instituted changes to reserve and capital requirements and corporate governance and fostered greater transparency. In line with the requirements of the local Solvency II, insurance companies calculate and report their capital requirement using a standard formula designed by the local regulators ( CNSF ). In addition, as required, the Company completed and submitted its first Own Risk and Solvency Assessment to the CSNF on October 31, 2016, as   previously approved by the Board of Directors. 

103 

     Table of Contents  

In Chile, the law implementing Solvency II-like regulation continues in the studies stage. However, the Chilean insurance regulator has already issued two resolutions, one for governance, and the other for risk management and control framework requirements. MetLife Chile has already implemented governance changes and risk policies to comply with these resolutions. A fourth impact study was completed and submitted in July 2016. On March 31, 2016, the local regulator issued a final regulation which requires insurance companies to implement a risk appetite framework and produce an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment. The first such report must be submitted to the local regulator no later than September 30, 2017. Even though a formal implementation date has not yet been set, it is estimated that the new solvency and supervisory regime could be in force between 2018 and 2019. 
   
  Global Systemically Important Insurers 
  The IAIS, an association of insurance supervisors and regulators and a member of the Financial Stability Board ( FSB ), an international entity established to coordinate, develop and promote regulatory, supervisory and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability, is participating in the FSB s initiative to identify and manage global systemically important financial institutions. To this end, the IAIS published a methodology to assess the systemic relevance of global insurers and a framework of policy measures to be applied to G-SIIs and, on this basis, the FSB again so designated MetLife, Inc. in 2015. The IAIS/FSB process is separate from the U.S. FSOC designation process and MetLife, Inc. remains a G-SII in spite of the rescission of its U.S. non-bank SIFI designation on March 30, 2016. The global designation process is an annual process. Every three years, the IAIS evaluates whether updates to its assessment methodology are necessary. 
  Current standards call for G-SIIs to be subject to higher loss absorbency requirements ( HLA ). Given the absence of a common global base on which to calculate HLA for insurers, the FSB directed the IAIS to develop basic capital requirements ( BCR ). The first version of the IAIS HLA framework was endorsed by the FSB and the G20 in September and November 2015, respectively, and the BCR and HLA requirements are expected to be refined based on data confidentially submitted by certain G-SIIs to their group-wide supervisors until they are fully adopted and implemented in 2019. The IAIS published a new assessment methodology on June 16, 2016 which was used this year to assess a pool of approximately 50 insurers, including MetLife, Inc. The new methodology reflects changes in the previous definitions of non-traditional and non-insurance activity, along with certain other changes in both quantitative and qualitative assessments. The assessments are complete and designations are pending. It is uncertain whether MetLife, Inc. will be designated a G-SII by the FSB under this new methodology. 
   
  Mortgage and Foreclosure-Related Exposures  
  MetLife no longer engages in the origination, sale and servicing of forward and reverse residential mortgage loans. See Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2015 Annual Report for further information regarding our mortgage and foreclosure-related exposures. 
  Notwithstanding MetLife Bank, National Association s ( MetLife Bank ) exit from the origination and servicing businesses, MetLife Home Loans LLC remains obligated to repurchase loans or compensate for losses upon demand due to alleged defects by MetLife Bank or its predecessor servicers in past servicing of the loans and material representations made in connection with MetLife Bank s sale of the loans. Reserves for representation and warranty repurchases and indemnifications were $45 million and $72 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Reserves for estimated future losses due to alleged deficiencies on loans originated and sold, as well as servicing of the loans including servicing acquired, are estimated based on unresolved claims and projected losses under investor servicing contracts where MetLife Bank s past actions or inactions are likely to result in missing certain stipulated investor timelines. Reserves for servicing defects were $11 million and $31 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Management is satisfied that adequate provision has been made in the Company s interim condensed consolidated financial statements for those representation and warranty obligations that are currently probable and reasonably estimable.

Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported on the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The most critical estimates include those used in determining: 
           (i) 
    liabilities for future policy benefits and the accounting for reinsurance; 
              (ii) 
    capitalization and amortization of DAC and the establishment and amortization of VOBA; 
              (iii) 
    estimated fair values of investments in the absence of quoted market values; 
              (iv) 
    investment impairments; 
              (v) 
    estimated fair values of freestanding derivatives and the recognition and estimated fair value of embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation; 
              (vi) 
    measurement of goodwill and related impairment; 
              (vii) 
    measurement of employee benefit plan liabilities; 
              (viii) 
    measurement of income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets; and 
              (ix) 
    liabilities for litigation and regulatory matters. 
     In addition, the application of acquisition accounting requires the use of estimation techniques in determining the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed   the most significant of which relate to aforementioned critical accounting estimates. In applying our accounting policies, we make subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to our business and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
  The above critical accounting estimates are described in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates  and Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the   2015   Annual Report. 
  We accelerated the annual review of our actuarial assumptions for our U.S. variable annuities business from the third quarter to the second quarter of 2016 in connection with the proposed Separation. As a result of this review, we made changes to policyholder behavior and long-term economic assumptions, as well as risk margins. With respect to policyholder behavior, which was the significant update for the second quarter of 2016, we have recorded charges, and in some cases benefits, in prior years as a result of the availability of sufficient and credible data at the conclusion of each review. As an example in 2012, we recorded a charge to reflect better than expected persistency; and in 2014, we recorded a charge as we began to reflect lower utilization of the elective annuitization option in early generations of our guaranteed minimum income benefit ( GMIBs ). In addition, in the third quarter of 2016, we performed the annual review of our actuarial assumptions for all of our remaining annuity and life businesses. See    Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Value of Business Acquired  and    Derivatives  noted below and    Results of Operations   Consolidated Results   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared with the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   Actuarial Assumption Review  and    Results of Operations   Consolidated Results   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared with the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   Actuarial Assumption Review  for further information. 
   
  Goodwill 
  Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test. 
  For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. In such instances, the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be determined in a business acquisition. The key inputs, judgments and assumptions necessary in determining estimated fair value of the reporting units include projected operating earnings, current book value, the level of economic capital required to support the mix of business, long-term growth rates, comparative market multiples, the account value of in-force business, projections of new and renewed business, as well as margins on such business, the level of interest rates, credit spreads, equity market levels, and the discount rate that we believe is appropriate for the respective reporting unit.

In connection with the reorganization, the Company realigned certain businesses among its existing and new segments. As a result, the Company reallocated goodwill based on the relative fair values of the businesses that it realigned and the portion of the reporting unit that it retained. The Company performed an analysis to identify all reporting units under this revised structure.  
  In the third quarter of 2016, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test on its Brighthouse Financial Life reporting unit and   Brighthouse Financial Run-off reporting unit   based upon its best available data at June 30, 2016. The Company utilized either an actuarial based embedded value or the cash flow testing valuation approaches, which estimate the net worth of the reporting unit and the value of existing and new business, if applicable. Under these actuarial-based methodologies, the estimated fair value of these reporting units was less than the carrying value, indicating a potential for goodwill impairment. The Brighthouse Financial Life reporting unit s fair value is negatively impacted by   a concentration in universal life products including those with secondary guarantees without the benefit of having a significant book of traditional life insurance. The Brighthouse Financial Run-off reporting unit, as a closed block, resulted in utilization of a higher discount rate reflective of expected risk-adjusted returns associated with such business which negatively impacted the estimated fair value of this reporting unit.   As a result, the Company performed Step 2 of the goodwill impairment process, which compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying value. This analysis indicated that the allocated goodwill associated with this reporting unit was not recoverable. Therefore, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $147 million ($126 million, net of income tax) and $113 million ($97 million, net of income tax) for the Brighthouse Financial Life and Brighthouse Financial Run-off reporting units, respectively, for the impairment of the entire goodwill balance which is reported in goodwill impairment in the interim condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for both the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
  In addition, in the third quarter of 2016, the Company tested the MetLife Holdings Life reporting unit for impairment using the actuarial based embedded value fair valuation approach. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by approximately 13% and, therefore, the reporting unit was not impaired. If we had assumed that the discount rate was 100 basis points higher than the discount rate used, the estimated fair value of the MetLife Holdings Life reporting unit would have been less than the carrying value by approximately 7%. The MetLife Holdings Life reporting unit consists of operations relating to products and businesses no longer actively marketed by the Company. As of September 30, 2016, the amount of goodwill allocated to the MetLife Holdings Life reporting unit was $887 million. 
  The Company also performed its annual goodwill impairment tests of all other reporting units during the third quarter of 2016 using a qualitative assessment and/or quantitative assessments under the market multiple, discounted cash flow and/or actuarial-based valuation approaches based on best available data as of June 30, 2016 and concluded that the estimated fair values of all such reporting units were in excess of their carrying values and, therefore, goodwill was not impaired.   
  We apply significant judgment when determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units and when assessing the relationship of market capitalization to the aggregate estimated fair value of our reporting units. The valuation methodologies utilized are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change. Estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent only management s reasonable expectation regarding future developments. These estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will, in all likelihood, differ in some respects from actual future results. Declines in the estimated fair value of our reporting units could result in goodwill impairments in future periods which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial position. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company s goodwill. 
   
  Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Value of Business Acquired 
  We periodically review long-term assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross margins and profits. These assumptions primarily relate to investment returns, policyholder dividend scales, interest crediting rates, mortality, persistency, and expenses to administer business. Assumptions used in the calculation of estimated gross margins and profits which may have significantly changed are updated annually. We expect these assumptions to be the ones most reasonably likely to cause significant changes in the future. Changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time.  
  As previously discussed, during the second quarter of 2016, the Company made changes to policyholder behavior and long-term economic assumptions, as well as risk margins, resulting in changes to the actual and expected future gross profits. Other assumptions, such as expenses, in-force or persistency assumptions and policyholder dividends on participating traditional life contracts, variable and universal life contracts were reviewed in the third quarter of 2016 as part of the annual actuarial assumption review. See    Results of Operations   Consolidated Results   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared with the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   Actuarial Assumption Review    and    Results of Operations   Consolidated Results   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared with the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   Actuarial Assumption Review    for further information.

At September 30, 2016, DAC and VOBA for the Company was $24.7 billion. In addition to assumption updates, amortization of DAC and VOBA associated with the variable and universal life and annuity contracts was significantly impacted by movements in equity markets. The following illustrates the effect on DAC and VOBA of changing each of the respective assumptions, as well as updating estimated gross margins or profits with actual gross margins or profits during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Increases (decreases) in DAC and VOBA balances, as presented below, resulted in a corresponding decrease (increase) in amortization. 

The following represent significant items contributing to the changes to DAC and VOBA amortization for the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 
             
    Changes in net investment and net derivative gains (losses) resulted in the following changes in DAC and VOBA amortization: 
                
    Actual gross profits decreased as a result of an increase in liabilities associated with guarantee obligations on variable annuities, resulting in a decrease of DAC and VOBA amortization of approximately $1.1 billion, excluding the impact from our nonperformance risk and risk margins, which are described below. The increase in the guarantee liability valuations on variable annuities was mostly attributable to the annual assumption review, which is described more fully in        Results of Operations       Consolidated Results       Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared with the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016       Actuarial Assumption Review.  Mark-to-market changes on the freestanding derivatives hedging such guarantee obligations resulted in a decrease in DAC and VOBA amortization of approximately $100 million. 
                
    The Company s nonperformance risk adjustment decreased the valuation of guaranteed liabilities, increased actual gross profits and increased DAC and VOBA amortization by approximately $265 million. This is more than offset by higher risk margins, which increased the guarantee liability valuations, decreased actual gross profits and decreased DAC and VOBA amortization by approximately $400 million. 
                
    The change in current and projected GMIB liabilities, mostly attributable to long-term investment rate of return and policyholder behavior related assumptions updates, as well as hedge gains, resulted in an increase to DAC and VOBA amortization of approximately $170 million. 
                
    The change in other is primarily driven by: 
                
    An acceleration of approximately $360 million of DAC amortization associated with universal life products resulting from the re-segmentation of MetLife businesses to establish a Brighthouse Financial segment. 
                
    An increase of approximately $110 million of DAC amortization resulting from the annual assumption update of the closed block.  
      
  Derivatives 
  The table below illustrates the impact that a range of reasonably likely variances in credit spreads would have on our consolidated balance sheet, excluding the effect of income tax, related to the embedded derivative valuation on certain variable annuity products measured at estimated fair value. In determining the ranges, we have considered current market conditions, as well as the market level of spreads that can reasonably be anticipated over the near term. The ranges do not reflect extreme market conditions such as those experienced during the 2008-2009 financial crisis as we do not consider those to be reasonably likely events in the near future.

As previously discussed, during the second quarter of 2016, the Company made changes to the actuarial assumptions that resulted in an increase in the fair value of the embedded derivatives. The impact of the range of reasonably likely variances in credit spreads also increased significantly as compared to prior periods. However, these estimated effects do not take into account potential changes in other variables, such as equity price levels and market volatility, which can also contribute significantly to changes in carrying values. Therefore, the table does not necessarily reflect the ultimate impact on the consolidated financial statement under the credit spread variance scenarios presented below.

  Economic Capital 
  Economic capital is an internally developed risk capital model, the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed. The economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in our business. 
  Our economic capital model, coupled with considerations of local capital requirements, aligns segment allocated equity with emerging standards and consistent risk principles. The model applies statistics-based risk evaluation principles to the material risks to which the Company is exposed. These consistent risk principles include calibrating required economic capital shock factors to a specific confidence level and time horizon while applying an industry standard method for the inclusion of diversification benefits among risk types. Economic capital-based risk estimation is an evolving science and industry best practices have emerged and continue to evolve. Areas of evolving industry best practices include stochastic liability valuation techniques, alternative methodologies for the calculation of diversification benefits, and the quantification of appropriate shock levels. MetLife s management is responsible for the ongoing production and enhancement of the economic capital model and reviews its approach periodically to ensure that it remains consistent with emerging industry practice standards. 
  Segment net investment income, with the exception of the Brighthouse Financial segment, is credited or charged based on the level of allocated equity; however, changes in allocated equity do not impact our consolidated net investment income, operating earnings or net income (loss). The Brighthouse Financial segment s net investment income represents that of the legal entities which comprise Brighthouse and its subsidiaries on a historical basis, however, may not be indicative of that on a combined standalone basis.  
  Net investment income is based upon the actual results of each segment s specifically identifiable investment portfolios adjusted for allocated equity. Other costs are allocated to each of the segments based upon: (i) a review of the nature of such costs; (ii) time studies analyzing the amount of employee compensation costs incurred by each segment; and (iii) cost estimates included in the Company s product pricing.

  Consolidated Results 
  Business Overview.   Overall sales improved from prior period levels as a result of increased sales of certain products within our segments for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. An overall increase in sales from our U.S. segment was primarily driven by   the timing of our funding agreement issuances and an increase in structured settlement annuity sales due to price competition, partially offset by   l  ower pension risk transfers and decreases in sales of income annuities and post-retirement benefit products.   For our EMEA segment, improved sales in the Middle East and the U.K. were partially offset by strong prior period sales in Poland. In our MetLife Holdings and Brighthouse Financial segments, life and a  nnuity sales declined as a result of the proposed Separation and the U.S. Retail Advisor Force Divestiture. In our Latin America segment, lower group life, medical and pension sales were partially offset by higher sales of property   casualty and accident   health products. S  ales in our Asia segment declined primarily due to   management actions taken to improve product value  .  

Three Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared with the   Three Months Ended     September 30, 2015 
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, income (loss) before provision for income tax decreased $1.6 billion ($625 million, net of income tax) from the prior period primarily driven by an unfavorable change in net derivatives gains (losses) and a current period goodwill impairment charge, partially offset by a favorable change in operating earnings.

Management of Investment Portfolio and Hedging Market Risks with Derivatives.   We manage our investment portfolio using disciplined Asset/Liability Management ( ALM ) principles, focusing on cash flow and duration to support our current and future liabilities. Our intent is to match the timing and amount of liability cash outflows with invested assets that have cash inflows of comparable timing and amount, while optimizing risk-adjusted net investment income and risk-adjusted total return. Our investment portfolio is heavily weighted toward fixed income investments, with over 80% of our portfolio invested in fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans. These securities and loans have varying maturities and other characteristics which cause them to be generally well suited for matching the cash flow and duration of insurance liabilities. We also use derivatives as an integral part of our management of the investment portfolio to hedge certain risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and equity market levels. In addition, our general account investment portfolio includes, within fair value option ( FVO ) and trading securities, contractholder-directed unit-linked investments supporting unit-linked variable annuity type liabilities, which do not qualify as separate account assets. The returns on these contractholder-directed unit-linked investments, which can vary significantly from period to period, include changes in estimated fair value subsequent to purchase, inure to contractholders and are offset in earnings by a corresponding change in policyholder account balances through interest credited to policyholder account balances. 
  We purchase investments to support our insurance liabilities and not to generate net investment gains and losses. However, net investment gains and losses are incurred and can change significantly from period to period due to changes in external influences, including changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and equity markets; counterparty specific factors such as financial performance, credit rating and collateral valuation; and internal factors such as portfolio rebalancing. Changes in these factors from period to period can significantly impact the levels of both impairments and realized gains and losses on investments sold. 
  We use freestanding interest rate, equity, credit and currency derivatives to hedge certain invested assets and insurance liabilities. Certain of these hedges are designated and qualify as accounting hedges, which reduce volatility in earnings. For those hedges not designated as accounting hedges, changes in market factors lead to the recognition of fair value changes in net derivative gains (losses) generally without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged, which creates volatility in earnings. 
  Certain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits contain embedded derivatives that are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract, with changes in estimated fair value recorded in net derivative gains (losses). We use freestanding derivatives to hedge the market risks inherent in these variable annuity guarantees. The valuation of these embedded derivatives includes a nonperformance risk adjustment, which is unhedged, and can be a significant driver of net derivative gains (losses) and volatility in earnings, but does not have an economic impact on us.

Net Derivative Gains (Losses).     The variable annuity embedded derivatives and associated freestanding derivative hedges are collectively referred to as  VA program derivatives  in the following table. All other derivatives that are economic hedges of certain invested assets and insurance liabilities are referred to as  non-VA program derivatives  in the following table. The table below presents the impact on net derivative gains (losses) from non-VA program derivatives and VA program derivatives: 

The unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on non-VA program derivatives was $1.1 billion ($736 million, net of income tax). This was primarily due to long-term interest rates decreasing less in the current period than in the prior period, unfavorably impacting receive-fixed interest rate swaps and interest rate swaptions primarily hedging long duration liability portfolios. In addition, a change in the value of the assets underlying reinsurance-related funds withheld unfavorably impacted non-VA embedded derivatives. Non-VA embedded derivatives were also unfavorably impacted by certain equity-indexed fixed annuities due to key equity index levels increasing in the current period but decreasing in the prior period. Because certain of these hedging strategies are not designated or do not qualify as accounting hedges, the changes in the estimated fair value of these freestanding derivatives are recognized in net derivative gains (losses) without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged. 
  The unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on VA program derivatives was $403 million ($262 million, net of income tax). This was due to an unfavorable change of $477 million ($310 million, net of income tax) related to the change in the nonperformance risk adjustment on embedded derivatives and by an unfavorable change of $154 million ($100 million, net of income tax) in market risks in embedded derivatives, net of the impact of freestanding derivatives hedging those risks, partially offset by a favorable change of $228 million ($148 million, net of income tax) in other risks in embedded derivatives. Other risks relate primarily to the impact of policyholder behavior and other non-market risks that generally cannot be hedged. 
  The aforementioned $477 million ($310 million, net of income tax) unfavorable change in the nonperformance risk adjustment on embedded derivatives was due to an unfavorable change of $266 million, before income tax, as a result of model changes and changes in capital market inputs, such as long-term interest rates and key equity index levels, on the variable annuity guarantees and an unfavorable change of $211 million, before income tax, related to changes in our own credit spread. 
  The foregoing $154 million ($100 million, net of income tax) unfavorable change was comprised of a $3.2 billion ($2.1 billion, net of income tax) unfavorable change in freestanding derivatives hedging market risks in embedded derivatives, which was offset by a $3.0 billion ($2.0 billion, net of income tax) favorable change in market risks in embedded derivatives. 
  
   111 

     Table of Contents  

The primary changes in market factors are summarized as follows: 
             
    Long-term interest rates decreased less in the current period than in the prior period, contributing to an unfavorable change in our freestanding derivatives and a favorable change in our embedded derivatives. For example, the 30-year U.S. swap rate decreased by 3% in the current period and decreased by 14% in the prior period. 
                
    Key equity index levels mainly increased in the current period and decreased in the prior period, contributing to an unfavorable change in our freestanding derivatives and a favorable change in our embedded derivatives. For example, the Standard   Poor s Ratings Services ( S P ) 500 Index increased by 3% in the current period and decreased by 7% in the prior period. 
                
    Key equity volatility measures decreased in the current period and were mixed in the prior period, contributing to a favorable change in our embedde  d derivatives and an unfavorable change in our freestanding derivatives. 
     The aforementioned $228 million ($148 million, net of income tax) favorable change in other risks in embedded derivatives reflected: 
             
    The cross effect of capital markets changes, which resulted in a favorable period over period change in the valuation of the embedded derivatives; 
                
    A decrease in the risk margin adjustment, measuring policyholder behavior risks, which was also affected by market and interest rate changes; and 
                
    In-force changes and the mismatch of fund performance between actual and modeled funds; partially offset by 
                
    A combination of other factors, including reserve changes influenced by benefit features and actual policyholder behavior, as well as FCTA. 
     When equity index levels decrease in isolation, the variable annuity guarantees become more valuable to policyholders, which results in an increase in the undiscounted embedded derivative liability. Discounting this unfavorable change by the risk adjusted rate yields a smaller loss than by discounting at the risk-free rate, thus creating a gain from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk. 
  When the risk-free interest rate decreases in isolation, discounting the embedded derivative liability produces a higher valuation of the liability than if the risk-free interest rate had remained constant. Discounting this unfavorable change by the risk adjusted rate yields a smaller loss than by discounting at the risk-free interest rate, thus creating a gain from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk. 
  When our own credit spread increases in isolation, discounting the embedded derivative liability produces a lower valuation of the liability than if our own credit spread had remained constant. As a result, a gain is created from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk. For each of these primary market drivers, the opposite effect occurs when they move in the opposite direction. 
  Net Investment Gains (Losses)  . The unfavorable change in net investment gains (losses) of $125 million ($81 million, net of income tax) primarily reflects higher gains on sales of real estate in the prior year. This unfavorable change was partially offset by higher current period gains on sales of fixed maturity securities and lower current period losses on other limited partnership interests, as well as a gain from the U.S. Retail Advisor Force Divestiture in the current period. 
  Goodwill  . The three months ended September 30, 2016 includes a $260 million ($223 million, net of income tax) non-cash charge for goodwill impairment associated with our Brighthouse Financial segment. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Actuarial Assumption Review  . We annually review our long-term actuarial assumption for policyholder behavior, market returns and other actuarial items. With respect to policyholder behavior, we have recorded charges, and in some cases, benefits in prior years as a result of the availability of sufficient and credible data at the conclusion of each review. See    Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates.  During the current period, we performed a review of assumptions related to reserves and DAC for our annuity and life businesses, with the exception of our U.S. variable annuity business, which was reviewed in the second quarter of 2016 in connection with the proposed Separation.  
  Results for the current period include an $94 million ($59 million, net of income tax) loss associated with our annual assumption review related to reserves and DAC, of which a $15 million gain ($10 million, net of income tax) was recognized in net derivative gains (losses). Of the $94 million loss, $109 million ($69 million, net of income tax) was associated with DAC and a benefit of $15 million ($10 million, net of income tax) was related to reserves. The $15 million gain recognized in net derivative gains (losses) associated with this review of assumptions was included within the other risks caption in the table above.

     Table of Contents  

As a result of our current period annual actuarial assumption review, changes were made to economic, policyholder behavior, mortality and other assumptions. The most significant impacts were in the MetLife Holdings segment and are summarized as follows: 
             
    Change in economic assumptions resulted in a release of DAC and increase of reserves, resulting in a net loss of $57 million ($37 million, net of income tax).   
                
    Change in policyholder behavior and mortality assumptions resulted in an increase in DAC, resulting in a net gain of $49 million ($33 million, net of income tax).  
                
    The remaining assumption updates resulted in a release of DAC, partially offset by a decrease in reserves resulting in a loss of $86 million ($55 million, net of income tax). The most notable assumption update was a net loss related to our projection of closed block results.  
     Results for the prior period include a $313 million ($203 million, net of income tax) charge associated with our annual assumption review related to reserves and DAC for all of our annuity and life businesses, of which a $3 million loss ($2 million, net of income tax) was recognized in net derivative gains (losses). Of the $313 million charge, $60 million ($39 million, net of income tax) was related to DAC and $253 million ($164 million, net of income tax) was associated with reserves.  
  Divested Businesses.     Income (loss) before provision for income tax related to the divested businesses, excluding net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses), increased $25 million ($16 million, net of income tax) to income of $24 million ($14 million, net of income tax) in the current period from a loss of $1 million ($2 million, net of income tax) in the prior period. Included in this decline was a slight decrease in total revenues and a decrease in total expenses of $26 million, before income tax. The current period includes     expenses and charges associated with the     U.S Retail Advisor Force Divestiture     and the proposed Separation  .    
  Taxes.   Income tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $25 million, or (5)% of income (loss) before provision for income tax, compared with income tax expense of $965 million, or 45% of income (loss) before provision for income tax, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The Company s effective tax rates differ from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% typically due to non-taxable investment income, tax credits for low income housing, and foreign earnings taxed at lower rates than the U.S. statutory rate. Current period results include a one-time tax benefit of $36 million for tax audit settlements, partially offset by a charge of $22 million related to the filing of the Company s U.S. federal tax return. Current period results also include the aforementioned $260 million ($223 million, net of income tax) non-cash charge for goodwill impairment. The tax benefit on this charge was limited to $37 million on the associated tax goodwill. Prior period results include a one-time tax charge of $557 million recorded under accounting guidance for the recognition of tax uncertainties. In addition, prior period results include one-time tax benefits of $61 million related to the restructuring of our business in Chile, $57 million related to the repatriation of earnings from Japan and $16 million related to the filing of the Company s U.S. federal tax return. 
  Operating Earnings.   As more fully described in    Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures,  we use operating earnings, which does not equate to net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP, to analyze our performance, evaluate segment performance, and allocate resources. We believe that the presentation of operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders, as we measure it for management purposes, enhances the understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders should not be viewed as substitutes for net income (loss) and net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc. s common shareholders, respectively. Operating earnings available to common shareholders increased $716 million, net of income tax, to $1.4 billion, net of income tax, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $705 million, net of income tax, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared with the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, income (loss) before provision for income tax decreased $3.0 billion ($1.6 billion, net of income tax) from the prior period primarily driven by unfavorable changes in net derivative gains (losses) and operating earnings, as well as a current period goodwill impairment charge. In addition, in the current period, income (loss) before provision for income tax includes the   financial impact of converting the Company s Japan operations to calendar year-end reporting without retrospective application of this change to prior periods.

Net Derivative Gains (Losses).     The variable annuity embedded derivatives and associated freestanding derivative hedges are collectively referred to as  VA program derivatives  in the following table. All other derivatives that are economic hedges of certain invested assets and insurance liabilities are referred to as  non-VA program derivatives  in the following table. The table below presents the impact on net derivative gains (losses) from non-VA program derivatives and VA program derivatives: 

The favorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on non-VA program derivatives was $1.5 billion ($961 million, net of income tax). This was primarily due to long-term interest rates decreasing more in the current period than in the prior period, favorably impacting receive-fixed interest rate swaps and interest rate swaptions primarily hedging long duration liability portfolios. The strengthening of the Japanese yen relative to other key currencies favorably impacted foreign currency forwards and futures that primarily hedge foreign denominated bonds. Because certain of these hedging strategies are not designated or do not qualify as accounting hedges, the changes in the estimated fair value of these freestanding derivatives are recognized in net derivative gains (losses) without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged. 
  These favorable changes were partially offset by a change in the value of the assets underlying reinsurance-related funds withheld unfavorably impacting non-VA embedded derivatives. Non-VA embedded derivatives were also unfavorably impacted by certain equity-indexed fixed annuities due to key equity index levels increasing in the current period but decreasing in the prior period. 
  The unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on VA program derivatives was $3.7 billion ($2.4 billion, net of income tax). This was due to an unfavorable change of $4.0 billion ($2.6 billion, net of income tax) in other risks in embedded derivatives and an unfavorable change of $700 million ($455 million, net of income tax) in market risks in embedded derivatives, net of the impact of freestanding derivatives hedging those risks, partially offset by a favorable change of $1.0 billion ($660 million, net of income tax) related to the change in the nonperformance risk adjustment on embedded derivatives. Other risks relate primarily to the impact of policyholder behavior and other non-market risks that generally cannot be hedged. 
  The foregoing $4.0 billion ($2.6 billion, net of income tax) unfavorable change in other risks in embedded derivatives reflected: 
             
    Updates to actuarial policyholder behavior assumptions within the valuation model. For details, see    Actuarial Assumption Review  and 
                
    An increase in the risk margin adjustment, measuring policyholder behavior risks, which was also affected by the second quarter 2016 actuarial assumption update, along with market and interest rate changes; partially offset by 
                
    The cross effect of capital market changes, a combination of other factors, including reserve changes influenced by benefit features and actual policyholder behavior, as well as FCTA.

     Table of Contents  

The foregoing $700 million ($455 million, net of income tax) unfavorable change reflects a $672 million ($437 million, net of income tax) unfavorable change in market risks in embedded derivatives and a $28 million ($18 million, net of income tax) unfavorable change in freestanding derivatives hedging market risks in embedded derivatives. 
  The primary changes in market factors are summarized as follows: 
             
    Long-term interest rates decreased more in the current period than in the prior period, contributing to a favorable change in our freestanding derivatives and an unfavorable change in our embedded derivatives. For example, the 30-year U.S. swap rate decreased by 32% in the current period and decreased by 7% in the prior period. 
                
    Key equity index levels were mixed in the current period and mostly decreased in the prior period, contributing to an unfavorable change in our freestanding derivatives and a favorable change in our embedded derivatives. For example, the S P 500 Index increased by 6% in the current period and decreased by 7% in the prior period. 
                
    Changes in foreign currency exchange rates contributed to a favorable change in our freestanding derivatives and an unfavorable change in our embedded derivatives related to the assumed reinsurance of certain variable annuity products from the Company s former operating joint venture in Japan. For example, the Japanese yen strengthened against the U.S. dollar by 16% in the current period and remained unchanged in the prior period. 
     The aforementioned $1.0 billion ($660 million, net of income tax) favorable change in the nonperformance risk adjustment on embedded derivatives resulted from a favorable change of $1.1 billion, before income tax, as a result of model changes and changes in capital market inputs, such as long-term interest rates and key equity index levels, on the variable annuity guarantees, partially offset by an unfavorable change of $34 million, before income tax, related to changes in our own credit spread. 
  Goodwill  . The nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes a $260 million ($223 million, net of income tax) non-cash charge for goodwill impairment associated with our Brighthouse Financial segment. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
     Actuarial Assumption Review  . Results for the current period include a $3.2 billion ($2.1 billion, net of income tax) non-cash charge associated with the annual review of assumptions related to reserves and DAC, of which a $3.7 billion loss ($2.4 billion, net of income tax) was recognized in net derivative gains (losses) and a loss of $103 million ($67 million, net of income tax) was recognized in updates to the closed block projection. Of the $3.2 billion charge, $3.9 billion ($2.5 billion, net of income tax) was related to reserves and a benefit of $732 million ($478 million, net of income tax) was associated with DAC.  
  The $3.7 billion loss recognized in net derivative gains (losses) associated with this review of assumptions was included within the other risks in embedded derivatives caption in the table above. 
  The significant impacts of the annual actuarial assumption review were on the U.S. variable annuity block of business and are summarized as follows: 
             
    Changes in policyholder behavior assumptions resulted in reserve increases, partially offset by favorable DAC amortization, resulting in a net charge of $2.3 billion ($1.5 billion, net of income tax). The policyholder behavior assumption changes included:  
           Lower utilization of the elective annuitization option on the guarantee riders on the contracts; 
       Lower election of the guaranteed principal option in certain of our GMIBs, which, if exercised, returns to the policyholder the original purchase payment amounts; 
        Adjusting the rate at which policyholders withdrew funds through systematic withdrawals; and 
        Higher policyholder persistency related to the portion of the business that will remain with the Company after the proposed Separation, dependent on the amount a contract is in-the-money. 
             
    Changes in economic assumptions resulted in reserve increases and unfavorable DAC amortization resulting in a charge of $487 million ($316 million, net of income tax). These changes include reducing the long-term separate account return assumption from 7.25% to 7.00% (from 7.00% to 6.75% for GMIB s invested in managed volatility funds), and reducing the projected ultimate 10-year treasury rate from 4.50% to 4.25%. 
                
    The remaining updates resulted in reserve increases from changes in risk margins, partially offset by favorable DAC, resulting in a charge of $428 million ($277 million, net of income tax).

Results for the prior period include a $313 million ($203 million, net of income tax) charge associated with our annual assumption review related to reserves and DAC, of which a $3 million loss ($2 million, net of income tax) was recognized in net derivative gains (losses). Of the $313 million charge, $60 million ($39 million, net of income tax) was related to DAC and $253 million ($164 million, net of income tax) was associated with reserves.  
  Divested Businesses and Lag Elimination.     Income (loss) before provision for income tax related to the divested businesses and lag elimination, excluding net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses), decreased $46 million ($36 million, net of income tax) to a loss of $49 million ($35 million, net of income tax) in the current period from a loss of $3 million (income of $1 million, net of income tax) in the prior period. Included in this decline was an increase in total revenues of $660 million, before income tax, and an increase in total expenses of $706 million, before income tax. The current period includes the     financial impact of converting the Company s Japan operations to calendar year-end reporting without retrospective application of this change to prior periods, as well as expenses and charges associated with the     U.S Retail Advisor Force Divestiture     and the proposed Separation  .    
  Taxes.   Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $480 million, or 14% of income (loss) before provision for income tax, compared with $1.9 billion, or 29% of income (loss) before provision for income tax, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company s effective tax rates differ from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% typically due to non-taxable investment income, tax credits for low income housing, and foreign earnings taxed at lower rates than the U.S. statutory rate. Our current period results include one-time tax benefits of $110 million in Japan related to a change in tax rate and $36 million for tax audit settlements, offset by one-time tax charges of $26 million related to the repatriation of earnings from Japan, $22 million related to the filing of the Company s U.S. federal tax return and $19 million in Chile related to a change in tax rate. Current period results also include the aforementioned $260 million ($223 million, net of income tax) non-cash charge for goodwill impairment. The tax benefit on this charge was limited to $37 million on the associated tax goodwill. Prior period results include a one-time tax charge of $557 million recorded under accounting guidance for the recognition of tax uncertainties. In addition, prior period results include one-time tax benefits of $174 million in Japan related to a change in tax rate, $61 million related to the restructuring of our business in Chile, $57 million related to the repatriation of earnings from Japan and $16 million related to the filing of the Company s U.S. federal tax return. 
  Operating Earnings  .   Operating earnings available to common shareholders decreased $434 million, net of income tax, to $3.7 billion, net of income tax, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $4.1 billion, net of income tax, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Consolidated Results   Operating 
  Three Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared with the   Three Months Ended     September 30, 2015 
  Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax. 
  Overview.   The primary drivers of the increase in operating earnings were prior period charges for taxes and related interest expenses, as well as higher net investment income from portfolio growth, partially offset by refinements made to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities and unfavorable underwriting. 
  Foreign Currency.   Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a   $13 million   positive impact on operating earnings for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the prior period.   Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of foreign currency fluctuations. Foreign currency fluctuations can result in significant variances in the financial statement line items. 
  Business Growth  .   A   $212 million   increase in operating earnings was attributable to business growth.   We benefited from positive net flows from many of our products. As a result, growth in the investment portfolios of our Asia, Brighthouse Financial, U.S., and Latin America segments generated higher net investment income.   However, this was partially offset by a corresponding increase in interest credited expense on certain insurance liabilities.    
  Market Factors  . Market factors, including sustained low interest rates, volatile equity markets, and foreign currency fluctuations, continued to impact our investment yields; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on reported net investment income in our non-U.S. segments and inflation-indexed investments, investment yields decreased. Investment yields were negatively impacted by the adverse impact of the sustained low interest rate environment on fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans as proceeds from maturing investments and the growth in the investment portfolio described above were invested at lower yields. Additionally, lower earnings on our securities lending program resulted from lower margins due to the impact of a flatter yield curve, as margins correlate more to the slope of the yield curve rather than the absolute level of interest rates. These decreases were partially offset by higher income on other limited partnership interests, alternative investments, bond prepayment fees, as well as currency and interest rate derivatives.   In addition, we experienced higher costs associated with our variable annuity   guaranteed minimum death benefits (   GMDBs ) in our Brighthouse Financial segment. These negative impacts to operating earnings were partially offset by lower DAC amortization, primarily in our Brighthouse Financial segment.   The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a   $25 million   decrease in operating earnings. 
  Underwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments  .   Unfavorable underwriting resulted in a   $96 million   decrease in operating earnings and was primarily due to unfavorable mortality, primarily in our Brighthouse Financial, MetLife Holdings and U.S. segments, partially offset by favorable morbidity in our U.S. segment. The impact of the annual actuarial assumption review resulted in an   $11 million   increase in operating earnings. The annual assumption review in the current period included our annuity and life businesses with the exception of our U.S. variable annuity business, which was reviewed in the second quarter of 2016; whereas, t  he annual review in the prior period included all of our annuity and life businesses.   Refinements to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities, which were recorded in both periods, resulted in a   $232 million   decrease in operating earnings, primarily as a result of a current period one-time charge of $254 million in our Brighthouse Financial segment, which was mostly recognized as a write-off of DAC. Our Brighthouse Financial segment also includes a current period charge of $42 million which resulted in an increase in our insurance-related liabilities. Both of these charges were due to loss recognition testing upon re-segmentation. 
  Expenses and Taxes.   In the prior period, other expenses include the aforementioned   $235 million   charge for interest on uncertain tax positions. In addition, other expenses declined   $51 million  , primarily due to lower costs associated with corporate initiatives and projects and the impact of   the   U.S. Retail Advisor Force Divestiture. The Company s current and prior period effective tax rates differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35%, primarily due to non-taxable investment income, tax credits for low income housing, and foreign earnings taxed at lower rates than the U.S. statutory rate. Current period results include a one-time tax benefit of $36 million for tax audit settlements, offset by a charge of $22 million related to the filing of the U.S. federal tax return. Prior period results include a one-time tax charge of $557 million recorded under accounting guidance for the recognition of tax uncertainties. In addition, prior period results include one-time tax benefits of $60 million related to the restructuring of our business in Chile, $31 million related to the repatriation of earnings from Japan and $16 million related to the filing of the Company s U.S. federal tax return.

Overview.   The primary drivers of the decrease in operating earnings were lower investment yields, refinements made to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities, unfavorable underwriting and the impact of our annual actuarial assumption review, partially offset by prior period charges for taxes and related interest expenses, as well as higher net investment income from portfolio growth. 
  Foreign Currency.   Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a   $36 million   negative impact on operating earnings for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the prior period.   Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of foreign currency fluctuations. Foreign currency fluctuations can result in significant variances in the financial statement line items. 
  Business Growth  .   A   $522 million   increase in operating earnings was attributable to business growth.   We benefited from positive net flows from many of our products. As a result, growth in the investment portfolios of our Asia, Brighthouse Financial, U.S., and Latin America segments generated higher net investment income.   However, this was partially offset by a corresponding increase in interest credited expense on certain insurance-related liabilities.  
  Market Factors  . Market factors, including sustained low interest rates, volatile equity markets, and foreign currency fluctuations, continued to impact our investment yields; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on reported net investment income in our non-U.S. segments and inflation-indexed investments, investment yields decreased. Investment yields were negatively impacted by the adverse impact of the sustained low interest rate environment on fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, as proceeds from maturing investments and the growth in the investment portfolio described above were invested at lower yields, in addition to a decrease in other limited partnership interests. Additionally, lower investment earnings on our securities lending program resulted from lower margins due to the impact of a flatter yield curve. These decreases in net investment income were partially offset by higher income on currency and interest rate derivatives. In our Brighthouse Financial and MetLife Holdings segments, declines in our average separate account balances resulted in a decrease in asset-based fee income. The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a   $800 million   decrease in operating earnings. 
  Underwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments  . Unfavorable underwriting resulted in a   $208 million   decrease in operating earnings as a result of higher non-catastrophe claim costs, less favorable development of prior year non-catastrophe losses,   a charge related to an adjustment to reinsurance receivables in our Asia segment  , as well as unfavorable mortality and morbidity experience primarily in our MetLife Holdings segment. The impact of the annual actuarial assumption review, which occurred in both periods, resulted in a   $154 million   decrease in operating earnings. Refinements to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities, which were recorded in both periods, resulted in a   $524 million   decrease in operating earnings, primarily as a result of a current period   reserve adjustment of $257 million resulting from modeling improvements in the reserving process in our universal life businesses, as well as   the aforementioned current period charges in our Brighthouse Financial segment totaling $296 million due to loss recognition testing upon re-segmentation. 
  Expenses and Taxes  .   I  n the prior period, other expenses include the aforementioned   $235 million   charge for interest on uncertain tax positions. In addition, other expenses declined   $78 million  , primarily due to lower costs associated with corporate initiatives and projects, a decrease in employee-related costs and the impact of   the   U.S. Retail Advisor Force Divestiture. The Company s current and prior period effective tax rates differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to non-taxable investment income, tax credits for low income housing, and foreign earnings taxed at lower rates than the U.S. statutory rate. The current period includes one-time tax charges of $26 million related to the repatriation of earnings from Japan, $22 million related to the filing of the U.S. federal tax return and $12 million in Chile related to change in tax rate, offset by one-time tax benefits of $36 million for tax audit settlements and $25 million in Japan, also related to a change in tax rate. The $25 million benefit includes a one-time benefit of $20 million that pertains to prior periods; the $12 million tax charge includes a one-time charge of $10 million that pertains to prior periods. Prior period results include a one-time tax charge of $557 million recorded under accounting guidance for the recognition of tax uncertainties. In addition, prior period results include one-time tax benefits of $61 million in Japan related to a change in tax rate, $60 million related to the restructuring of our business in Chile, $31 million related to the repatriation of earnings from Japan and $16 million related to the filing of the Company s U.S. federal tax return.

Segment Results and Corporate   Other 
   
  U.S.  
  Business Overview.     An increase in sales was primarily driven by the timing of our funding agreement issuances in our Retirement   Income Solutions business. Funding ratios for defined benefit pension plans of S P 500 companies continued to fall in 2016, limiting their ability to engage in full pension plan buyouts. However, we expect that customers may choose to close out portions of pension plans over time, with the largest volume of business generally occurring near the end of any year. The impact of this decline in funding ratios for defined benefit pension plans of S P 500 companies was lower pension risk transfers, which resulted in lower premiums. In addition, sales of income annuities and post-retirement benefit products were lower. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of a change in competitive pricing in the market, which drove an increase in structured settlement annuity sales. Changes in premiums for the Retirement   Income Solutions business were almost entirely offset by the related changes in policyholder benefits and claims. In our Property   Casualty business, sales of new policies were slightly lower for both the auto and homeowners lines of business. New policy sales were not sufficient to offset the impact of policies that were not renewed, resulting in a decrease in exposures. Sales improved across the Group Benefits business compared to the prior period.    

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared with the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 
  Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax. 
  Business Growth  . An increase in average premium per policy in both our auto and homeowners businesses improved operating earnings. In addition, higher deposits and funding agreement issuances in the current period resulted in higher invested assets, which drove an increase in net investment income. However, consistent with the growth in average invested assets from increased premiums, interest credited on long-duration contracts increased. In addition, an increase in other operating expenses, mainly the result of growth across the segment, was more than offset by the remaining increase in premiums, fees and other revenues. The combined impact of the items discussed above increased operating earnings by $46 million.

Market Factors  .   Market factors, including sustained low interest rates, volatile equity markets, and foreign currency fluctuations, continued to impact our investment yields; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks.   Investment yields increased driven by higher income on interest rate and currency derivatives, higher returns on real estate and real estate joint ventures, hedge funds and alternative investments. These increases were partially offset by the adverse impact of the sustained low interest rate environment on our fixed maturity securities, as proceeds from maturing investments   and the growth in the investment portfolio described above,   were invested at lower yields, as well as lower returns on private equities. In addition, lower interest crediting rates, consistent with the sustained low interest rate environment, contributed to the increase to operating earnings.   The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in an $8 million increase in operating earnings. 
  Underwriting  . Less favorable mortality in our term life business, mainly due to higher severity, was partially offset by favorable claims experience in our universal life business, which resulted in a decrease of $24 million in operating earnings. Favorable claims experience in our dental business combined with favorable morbidity in our individual disability business drove an increase in operating earnings of $18 million. Favorable mortality from our income annuity business was mostly offset by less favorable mortality in our specialized life insurance products. In our Property   Casualty business, non-catastrophe claim costs increased by $16 million, as a result of higher severities and frequencies in both our auto and homeowners businesses. In addition, our Property   Casualty business experienced less favorable development of prior year non-catastrophe losses of $8 million. These decreases were partially offset by a decrease in catastrophe losses of $10 million.  
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared with the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 
  Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax. 
  Business Growth  . An increase in average premium per policy in both our auto and homeowners businesses improved operating earnings. The impact of deposits, funding agreement issuances and increased premiums in the current period resulted in higher average invested assets, improving net investment income. However, consistent with the growth in average invested assets from increased premiums, interest credited on long-duration contracts increased. In addition, an increase in other operating expenses, mainly the result of growth across the segment, was more than offset by the remaining increase in premiums, fees and other revenues. The combined impact of the items discussed above increased operating earnings by $124 million. 
  Market Factors  .     Market factors, including sustained low interest rates, volatile equity markets, and foreign currency fluctuations, continued to impact our investment yields: however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks.     Investment yields decreased as a result of the impact of the sustained low interest rate environment on fixed maturity securities, as     proceeds from maturing investments and the growth in the investment portfolio described above were invested at lower yields, as well as lower returns on other limited part  nership interests and alternative investments. Additionally, lower investment earnings on our securities lending program resulted primarily from lower margins due to the impact of a flatter yield curve. These unfavorable changes were partially offset by higher income on interest rate and currency derivatives and higher returns on real estate and real estate joint ventures. Certain of our funding agreements and guaranteed interest contract liabilities have interest credited rates that are contractually tied to current market rates, specifically the 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate     ( LIBOR ) and, as a result, a higher average interest credited rate drove an increase in interest credited expense.     The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in an $181 million decrease in operating earnings. 
  Underwriting and Other Insurance Adjustments  . Unfavorable claims experience in our group disability and dental businesses were mostly offset by favorable claims experience in our individual disability and voluntary businesses and resulted in a $5 million decrease in operating earnings. Favorable mortality in the current period, mainly due to favorable claims experience in our life business, resulted in a $29 million increase in operating earnings. Less favorable mortality from our specialized life insurance products and pension risk transfer business resulted in a $16 million decrease in operating earnings. In our Property   Casualty business, non-catastrophe claim costs increased by $62 million, resulting from higher frequencies and severities in both our auto and homeowners businesses. In addition, less favorable development of prior year non-catastrophe losses reduced operating earnings by $36 million and an increase in catastrophe losses reduced operating earnings $8 million. Refinements to certain insurance and other liabilities, which were recorded in both periods, resulted in a $23 million decrease in operating earnings.

Asia 
  Business Overview.   Sales decreased compared to the prior period primarily due to management actions taken to improve product value in the region. In Japan, we have seen a successful shift in sales to foreign currency life products from yen life products and a decrease in accident and health sales. Sales also decreased, in comparison, as a result of the sale of a large group contract in Australia in the prior period. Sales increased in China, Hong Kong and Bangladesh mainly due to business growth. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared with the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 
  Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax. 
  Following a change in the foreign investment law in India, the Company no longer consolidates its India operating joint venture, effective January 1, 2016. While this change in accounting does affect the comparability of the financial statement line items, it did not have a significant impact on operating earnings and, therefore, is not discussed below. 
  Foreign Currency  . The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased operating earnings by $27 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the prior period as a result of the strengthening of the Japanese yen and the Korean won against the U.S. dollar. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of foreign currency fluctuations. Foreign currency fluctuations can result in significant variances in the financial statement line items. 
  Business Growth.   Positive net flows in Japan and Korea resulted in higher average invested assets and an increase in net investment income. Asia s premiums and fees decreased from the prior period mainly driven by lower fixed annuity surrenders and the continued shift from premium-based to fee-based products in the current period, as well as the discontinuation of single premium products in our accident and health business in Japan in the third quarter of 2015. Changes in premiums for these businesses were partially offset by related changes in policyholder benefits. The combined impact of the items discussed above improved operating earnings by $76 million.  
  Market Factors.   Investment returns were unfavorably impacted by lower interest rates on fixed maturity securities, as well as the impact of   incremental income recognized in   the prior period from recovery of a previously impaired mortgage loan in Japan. These decreases were partially offset by improved returns on other limited partnership interests and the favorable impact of increased foreign currency-denominated fixed annuities in Japan, which drove an increase in higher yielding foreign currency-denominated fixed maturity securities. Lower investment yields, combined with the impact of foreign currency hedges, decreased operating earnings by $111 million.

Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments  . The impact of our annual actuarial assumption review, which occurred in both periods, resulted in a net decrease of $35 million in operating earnings. Refinements to certain insurance and other liabilities, which were recorded in the current period, resulted in a $29 million increase in operating earnings. 
  Expenses and Taxes  . A $14 million decrease in expenses was primarily driven by declines in corporate overhead, project costs, information-technology and marketing expenses, as well as lower consumption tax. Current period results include a $7 million tax benefit due to a lower tax rate in Japan. Prior period results include one-time tax benefits of $15 million related to the U.S. taxation of dividends from Japan and $6 million for a tax refund in Korea related to unclaimed surrender value.  
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared with the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 
  Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax. 
  Following a change in the foreign investment law in India, the Company no longer consolidates its India operating joint venture, effective January 1, 2016. While this change in accounting does affect the comparability of the financial statement line items, it did not have a significant impact on operating earnings and, therefore, is not discussed below.  
  Foreign Currency  . The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased operating earnings by $34 million for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the prior period as a result of the strengthening of the Japanese yen and the Korean won against the U.S. dollar. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of foreign currency fluctuations. Foreign currency fluctuations can result in significant variances in the financial statement line items. 
  Business Growth.   Positive net flows in Japan and Korea resulted in higher average invested assets and an increase in net investment income. Asia s premiums and fees decreased from the prior period mainly driven by lower fixed annuity surrenders and the shift from premium-based to fee-based products in the current period and the discontinuation of single premium products in our accident   health business in Japan in the third quarter of 2015. Changes in premiums for these businesses were partially offset by related changes in policyholder benefits. The combined impact of the items discussed above improved operating earnings by $123 million.  
  Market Factors.   Investment returns were unfavorably impacted by lower interest rates on fixed maturity securities and lower returns on other limited partnership interests in Japan, as well as the impact of   incremental income recognized in   the prior period from recovery of a previously impaired mortgage loan in Japan. The decreases in investment returns were partially offset by the favorable impact of increased foreign currency-denominated fixed annuities in Japan, which drove an increase in higher yielding foreign currency-denominated fixed maturity securities. Lower investment yields, combined with the impact of foreign currency hedges, decreased operating earnings by $222 million. 
  Underwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments.   Our results for the current period include a $44 million charge related to an adjustment to reinsurance receivables in Australia. Excluding this charge, favorable claims experience in Australia and Korea, which was partially offset by lower fixed annuity surrender gains and higher lapses in Japan, increased operating earnings by $7 million. The impact of our annual actuarial assumption review, which occurred in both periods, resulted in a net decrease of $35 million in operating earnings. Refinements to certain insurance and other liabilities, which were recorded in the current period, resulted in a $29 million increase in operating earnings. 
  Taxes  . Current period results include a $25 million tax benefit related to a change in the corporate tax rate in Japan (which includes a one-time benefit of $20 million that pertains to prior periods) and a $26 million tax charge related to the U.S. taxation of dividends from Japan. Prior period results include one-time tax benefits of $61 million related to a change in tax rates, $12 million for the settlement of an audit and $15 million related to the U.S. taxation of dividends, each related to Japan. In addition, in the prior period, Korea received a tax refund of $6 million related to unclaimed surrender value.

Latin America 
  Business Overview.   Total sales for Latin America were down. The region experienced lower group life, medical and pension sales, partially offset by higher sales of property   casualty and accident   health products. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared with the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 
  Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax. 
  Foreign Currency  . The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased operating earnings by $10 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the prior period mainly due to the weakening of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of foreign currency fluctuations. Foreign currency fluctuations can result in significant variances in the financial statement line items. 
  Business Growth  . Latin America experienced business growth across several lines of business within Chile and Argentina. This business growth resulted in increased premiums, which was partially offset by the related changes in policyholder benefits. Positive net flows, primarily from Chile and Mexico, resulted in an increase in average invested assets and generated higher net investment income. This was partially offset by a corresponding increase in interest credited expense on certain insurance liabilities. Business growth also drove an increase in commissions, which were offset by increased DAC capitalization. The items discussed above resulted in a $16 million increase in operating earnings. 
  Market Factors  . Changes in market factors resulted in a $24 million increase to operating earnings. An increase in investment yields was primarily driven by higher returns on alternative investments in Chile, as well as a change in the crediting rate on allocated equity in Mexico and Chile. These increases were partially offset by lower returns on fixed maturity securities in Chile.    
  Underwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments  . Unfavorable underwriting resulted in a $9 million decrease to operating earnings, driven by higher claims experience in Mexico. The impact of the annual actuarial assumption review, which occurred in both periods, resulted in a net operating earnings increase of $16 million. Refinements to certain insurance liabilities and other adjustments in both the current and prior periods resulted in a $6 million decrease in operating earnings. 
  Taxes  . Effective September 1, 2015, AFP ProVida was merged into MetLife Chile Acquisition Company resulting in a one-time income tax benefit of $60 million in 2015. In addition, other tax-related adjustments resulted in a net decrease in operating earnings of $17 million and were mainly driven by tax charges related to the filing of local tax returns in Mexico and Chile.

  Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax. 
  Foreign Currency  . The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased operating earnings by $58 million for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the prior period mainly due to the weakening of the Mexican and Chilean pesos against the U.S. dollar. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of foreign currency fluctuations. Foreign currency fluctuations can result in significant variances in the financial statement line items. 
  Business Growth  . Latin America experienced business growth across several lines of business within Mexico, Chile and Argentina, as well as in the ProVida pension business. This business growth resulted in increased premiums and policy fee income which was partially offset by the related changes in policyholder benefits. Positive net flows, primarily from Chile and Mexico, resulted in an increase in average invested assets and generated higher net investment income. This was partially offset by a corresponding increase in interest credited expense on certain insurance liabilities. Business growth also drove an increase in operating expenses, commissions and DAC amortization, which were partially offset by higher DAC capitalization. The items discussed above resulted in a $56 million increase in operating earnings. 
  Market Factors  . Changes in market factors resulted in a $22 million increase to operating earnings as higher investment yields were partially offset by higher interest credited expense. An increase in investment yields was primarily driven by current period change in the crediting rate on allocated equity in Mexico and Chile and higher yields from fixed maturity securities in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. These increases were partially offset by lower returns on fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans in Chile.  
  Underwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments  . Favorable underwriting resulted in a $6 million increase in operating earnings driven by lower claims experience in Mexico and Chile. The impact of the annual actuarial assumption review, which occurred in both periods, resulted in a net operating earnings increase of $16 million. Refinements to certain insurance liabilities and other adjustments in both the current and prior periods resulted in a $2 million decrease to operating earnings. 
  Taxes  . Effective September 1, 2015, AFP ProVida was merged into MetLife Chile Acquisition Company resulting in a one-time income tax benefit of $60 million in 2015. In the first quarter of 2016, our Chilean businesses, including ProVida, incurred a tax charge of $12 million as a result of tax reform legislation in Chile (including a one-time charge of $10 million that pertains to prior periods). In addition, other tax-related adjustments resulted in a net decrease in operating earnings of $7 million and were mainly driven by tax charges related to the filing of local tax returns in Mexico and Chile, partially offset by a 2016 tax benefit related to the devaluation of the peso in Argentina.

  MetLife Holdings 
  Business Overview.   As a result of the proposed Separation and the U.S. Retail Advisor Force Divestiture, we have discontinued the marketing of life and annuity products in this segment, which has led to lower sales and will result in a declining DAC asset over time. A significant portion of our operating earnings is driven by separate account balances. Most directly, these balances determine asset-based fee income but they also impact DAC amortization and asset-based commissions. Separate account balances are driven by sales, movements in the market, surrenders, withdrawals, benefit payments, transfers and policy charges. Separate account balances have increased due to market performance, partially offset by the impact of negative net flows, as benefits, surrenders and withdrawals exceeded sales. While net flows are still negative, we are seeing stability in surrenders and withdrawals. Although we have discontinued selling our long-term care product, we continue to collect premiums and administer the existing block of business, which contributed to asset growth in the segment.

Business Growth  . A decrease in our invested asset base was primarily due to negative net flows in our life business and the recapture of an assumed fixed annuity agreement with an affiliate, which is reported in our Brighthouse Financial segment, in the second quarter of 2016. These declines were partially offset by the aforementioned impact of our long-term care business on asset growth, resulting in a modest decrease in net investment income. Consistent with the asset growth in the long-term care business, interest credited on insurance liabilities increased. These decreases in operating earnings were offset by the elimination of an operating loss from the broker-dealer operations in connection with the   U.S. Retail Advisor Force Divestiture   in the current period. The elimination of the operating loss from the broker-dealer operations resulted in declines in both revenues and expenses. In addition, the decreases in operating earnings were also offset by lower interest expense related to the aforementioned recapture of an assumed fixed annuity agreement. The net impact of the aforementioned items resulted in a $32 million increase in operating earnings. 
  Market Factors  . Market factors, including sustained low interest rates, volatile equity markets, and foreign currency fluctuations, continued to impact our investment yields; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Higher returns on other limited partnership interests and increased prepayment fees contributed to this increase in operating earnings. In addition, the impact of lower average crediting rates on certain insurance liabilities and a decrease in DAC amortization contributed to the increase in operating earnings. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the sustained low interest rate environment on net investment income, specifically from fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans as proceeds from maturing investments were reinvested at lower yields. In addition, we had lower income on interest rate derivatives. The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $21 million increase in operating earnings. 
  Underwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments  . Unfavorable mortality in our universal life and traditional life, businesses was partially offset by favorable morbidity in our long-term care business and resulted in a decrease of $30 million in operating earnings. The results of our annual review of actuarial assumptions resulted in a decrease in operating earnings of $10 million.   The annual review in the current period included our annuity and life businesses with the exception of our U.S. variable annuity business, which was reviewed in the second quarter of 2016; whereas, t  he annual review in the prior period included all of our annuity and life businesses. Refinements to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities recorded in the current period resulted in an increase in operating earnings of $5 million.   In addition, an increase in policyholder dividends in the closed block, which we instituted in the fourth quarter of 2015, decreased operating earnings by $10 million. 
  Expenses  . Operating earnings increased due to a decline in expenses of $18 million, mainly the result of lower amortization of deferred reinsurance commissions related to certain variable annuity reinsurance agreements entered into with an affiliate, which is reported in our Brighthouse Financial segment.  
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared with the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 
  Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax. 
  Business Growth  . Our life, annuities and long-term care businesses experienced net asset growth, which resulted in higher net investment income; however, consistent with the aforementioned asset growth, interest credited on insurance liabilities also increased. Additionally, the elimination of an operating loss from the broker-dealer operations in connection with the U.S. Retail Advisor Force Divestiture in the current period increased operating earnings. The elimination of the operating loss from the broker-dealer operations resulted in declines in both revenues and expenses. The aforementioned recapture of an assumed fixed annuity reinsurance agreement resulted in lower interest expense and an offsetting increase in DAC amortization. These increases were partially offset by a lower invested asset base due to the aforementioned recapture of an assumed fixed annuity agreement, the impact of lower sales and lower surrender charges in the current period. The combined impact of the items discussed above resulted in a $43 million increase in operating earnings. 
  Market Factors  . Market factors, including sustained low interest rates, volatile equity markets, and foreign currency fluctuations, continued to impact our investment yields; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Investment yields decreased on our fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans as proceeds from maturing investments and the growth in the investment portfolio described above were invested at lower yields. In addition, we had lower income on interest rate derivatives and alternative investments, as well as lower returns on other limited partnership interests. These decreases in net investment income were partially offset by higher prepayment fees and higher income on currency derivatives. In the deferred annuity business, operating earnings declined due to lower asset-based fee income, as average separate account balances decreased and DAC amortization increased. The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $193 million decrease in operating earnings.

Underwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments  . Unfavorable claims experience in our long-term care business, unfavorable mortality in our traditional life businesses and less favorable fund returns related to a significant reinsurance treaty resulted in a $45 million decrease in operating earnings. The impact of our annual actuarial assumption review, which occurred in both periods, resulted in a net operating earnings decrease of $34 million and was primarily related to unfavorable DAC unlockings. Refinements to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities that were recorded in both periods resulted in a $77 million decrease in operating earnings, which includes a current period reserve adjustment resulting from modeling improvements in the reserving process in our universal life business.   In addition, an increase in policyholder dividends in the closed block, which we instituted in the fourth quarter of 2015, decreased operating earnings by $19 million. 
  Expenses  . A $149 million net increase in expenses was primarily the result of costs associated with the aforementioned recapture of an assumed fixed annuity agreement. This increase in expenses was partially offset by lower amortization of deferred reinsurance commissions related to certain variable annuity reinsurance agreements entered into with an affiliate, which is reported in our Brighthouse Financial segment, as well as lower technology and employee-related costs.  
   
  Brighthouse Financial 
  Business Overview.   Sales from our life business decreased by 46%, primarily due to the U.S. Retail Advisor Force Divestiture at the beginning of the third quarter of 2016. Annuity sales decreased by 34%, primarily driven by a 50% decrease in variable annuity sales as a result of the proposed Separation and the suspension of sales through one distributor. In our annuities business, despite positive market performance in the current period, average separate account balances decreased primarily due to higher negative net flows and the impact of a significant market decline in the third quarter of 2015, which was not fully reflected in the prior period average asset balance.  

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared with the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 
  Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.  
  Business Growth  . A $50 million increase in operating earnings was attributable to business growth. Net investment income increased as a result of a larger invested asset base due to the recapture of a ceded fixed annuity agreement with an affiliate, which is reported in our MetLife Holdings segment, in the second quarter of 2016. Invested assets also increased as a result of a capital contribution from MetLife, Inc. and positive net flows in our general account from our annuities and life businesses, partially offset by funding agreement repayments. In our annuities business, other revenues decreased due to the aforementioned recapture of a ceded fixed annuity agreement.

Market Factors  .   Market factors, including sustained low interest rates, volatile equity markets, and foreign currency fluctuations, continued to impact our investment yields; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks.   Investment yields decreased on fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, as proceeds from maturing investments and the growth in the investment portfolio described above were invested at lower yields. Additionally, lower investment earnings on our securities lending program resulted from the impact of the sustained low interest rate environment and lower margins due to the impact of a flatter yield curve, as margins correlate more to the slope of the yield curve rather than the absolute level of interest rates. These unfavorable changes were partially offset by higher income on other limited partnership interests, interest rate and currency derivatives and real estate joint ventures. In our annuities business, lower equity returns in 2015 drove a decline in our average separate account balances which resulted in a decrease in asset-based fee income relative to the prior period. In addition, we experienced higher costs associated with our variable annuity GMDBs. These negative impacts to operating earnings were partially offset by lower DAC amortization and lower average interest credited rates for our annuities business.   The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $21 million decrease in operating earnings. 
  Underwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments  . Less favorable mortality experience in our universal life and run-off businesses, partially offset by favorable mortality in our traditional life and income annuity businesses resulted in a net decrease of $51 million to operating earnings. The impact of our annual actuarial assumption review resulted in a net increase in operating earnings of $62 million, primarily related to favorable unlockings in our annuities and life businesses.   The annual review in the current period included our annuity and life businesses with the exception of our U.S. variable annuity business, which was reviewed in the second quarter of 2016; whereas, t  he annual review in the prior period included all of our annuity and life businesses. Refinements to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities recorded in the current period resulted in a decrease in operating earnings of $275 million, primarily as a result of a $254 million one-time charge, mostly recognized as write-off of DAC, and a $42 million increase in our insurance-related liabilities, both due to loss recognition testing upon re-segmentation. 
  Expenses and Taxes  . Operating earnings increased due to a $13 million decrease in expenses primarily driven by lower expenses as a result of the   U.S. Retail Advisor Force Divestiture  . In the current period, we realized lower tax benefits of $57 million, primarily related to the separate account dividends received deduction. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared with the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 
  Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax. 
  Business Growth  . A $386 million increase in operating earnings was attributable to business growth. In the annuities business, an increase in fee income and a decrease in DAC amortization favorably impacted operating earnings primarily due to the aforementioned recapture of a ceded fixed annuity agreement. Net investment income also increased as a result of a larger invested asset base due to such recapture, a capital contribution from MetLife, Inc., and positive net flows in our general account from our annuities and life businesses, partially offset by funding agreement repayments. This increase in net investment income was also partially offset by higher interest credited expense as the same positive net flows in our general account resulted in a larger liability base. Additionally, other revenues decreased due to the aforementioned recapture of a ceded fixed annuity agreement. 
  Market Factors  .   Market factors, including sustained low interest rates, volatile equity markets, and foreign currency fluctuations, continued to impact our investment yields; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks.   Investment yields decreased on fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans as a result of the sustained low interest rate environment, as proceeds from maturing investments and the growth in the investment portfolio described above were invested at lower yields. Lower returns on real estate joint ventures also contributed to a decrease in net investment income. Additionally, lower earnings on our securities lending program resulted from lower margins as a result of the impact of a flatter yield curve. These unfavorable changes were partially offset by higher income on interest rate derivatives. In our annuities business, lower equity returns in 2015 drove a decline in our average separate account balances which resulted in a decrease in asset-based fee income relative to the prior period. In addition, we experienced higher costs associated with our variable annuity GMDBs, partially offset by lower DAC amortization and lower average interest crediting rates for our annuities business.   The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $214 million decrease in operating earnings.

Investments 
   
  Investment Risks 
  Our primary investment objective is to optimize, net of income tax, risk-adjusted investment income and risk-adjusted total return while ensuring that assets and liabilities are managed on a cash flow and duration basis. The Investments Department, led by the Chief Investment Officer, manages investment risks using a risk control framework comprised of policies, procedures and limits, as discussed further below. The Investments Risk Committee, chaired by the Global Risk Management Department, reviews and monitors investment risk limits and tolerances. We are exposed to the following primary sources of investment risks: 
             
    credit risk, relating to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest; 
                
    interest rate risk, relating to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in market interest rates. Changes in market interest rates will impact the net unrealized gain or loss position of our fixed income investment portfolio and the rates of return we receive on both new funds invested and reinvestment of existing funds; 
                
    liquidity risk, relating to the diminished ability to sell certain investments, in times of strained market conditions; 
                
    market valuation risk, relating to the variability in the estimated fair value of investments associated with changes in market factors such as credit spreads. A widening of credit spreads will adversely impact the net unrealized gain (loss) position of the fixed income investment portfolio, will increase losses associated with credit-based non-qualifying derivatives where we assume credit exposure, and, if credit spreads widen significantly or for an extended period of time, will likely result in higher other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ). Credit spread tightening will reduce net investment income associated with purchases of fixed maturity securities and will favorably impact the net unrealized gain (loss) position of the fixed income investment portfolio; 
                
    currency risk, relating to the variability in currency exchange rates for foreign denominated investments. This risk relates to potential decreases in estimated fair value and net investment income resulting from changes in currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar. In general, the weakening of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar will adversely affect the estimated fair value of our foreign denominated investments; and 
                
    real estate risk, relating to commercial, agricultural and residential real estate, and stemming from factors, which include, but are not limited to, market conditions, including the demand and supply of leasable commercial space, creditworthiness of commercial tenants and partners, capital markets volatility and the inherent interest rate movement. 
     We manage investment risk through in-house fundamental credit analysis of the underlying obligors, issuers, transaction structures and real estate properties. We also manage credit risk, market valuation risk and liquidity risk through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation. Risk limits to promote diversification by asset sector, avoid concentrations in any single issuer and limit overall aggregate credit exposure as measured by our economic capital framework, are approved annually by a committee of directors that oversees our investment portfolio. For real estate assets, we manage credit risk and market valuation risk through geographic, property type and product type diversification and asset allocation. We manage interest rate risk as part of our ALM strategies. These strategies include maintaining an investment portfolio with diversified maturities that has a weighted average duration that is approximately equal to the duration of our estimated liability cash flow profile, and utilizing product design, such as the use of market value adjustment features and surrender charges, to manage interest rate risk. We also manage interest rate risk through proactive monitoring and management of certain non-guaranteed elements of our products, such as the resetting of credited interest and dividend rates for policies that permit such adjustments. In addition to hedging with foreign currency derivatives, we manage currency risk by matching much of our foreign currency liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries with their respective foreign currency assets, thereby reducing our risk to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation. We also use certain derivatives in the management of credit, interest rate, and equity market risks. 
  We use purchased credit default swaps to mitigate credit risk in our investment portfolio. Generally, we purchase credit protection by entering into credit default swaps referencing the issuers of specific assets we own. In certain cases, basis risk exists between these credit default swaps and the specific assets we own. For example, we may purchase credit protection on a macro basis to reduce exposure to specific industries or other portfolio concentrations. In such instances, the referenced entities and obligations under the credit default swaps may not be identical to the individual obligors or securities in our investment portfolio. In addition, our purchased credit default swaps may have shorter tenors than the underlying investments they are hedging. However, we dynamically hedge this risk through the rebalancing and rollover of our credit default swaps at their most liquid tenors. We believe that our purchased credit default swaps serve as effective economic hedges of our credit exposure. 
  
   137 

     Table of Contents  

We generally enter into market standard purchased and written credit default swap contracts. Payout under such contracts is triggered by certain credit events experienced by the referenced entities. For credit default swaps covering North American corporate issuers, credit events typically include bankruptcy and failure to pay on borrowed money. For European corporate issuers, credit events typically also include involuntary restructuring. With respect to credit default contracts on Western European sovereign debt, credit events typically include failure to pay debt obligations, repudiation, moratorium, or involuntary restructuring. In each case, payout on a credit default swap is triggered only after the Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association deems that a credit event has occurred. 
   
  Current Environment 
  The global economy and markets continue to be affected by stress and volatility, which has adversely affected the financial services sector, in particular, and global capital markets. Recently, weakness in the energy and metals and mining sectors and political and/or economic instability in the U.K., Brazil, Turkey, Russia, Ukraine, China, Japan, the Middle East and Puerto Rico, as well as Europe s perimeter region and Cyprus, have contributed to global market volatility. 
  Events following the U.K. s referendum on June 23, 2016 and the uncertainties associated with its pending withdrawal from the EU have contributed to market volatility. The risk of market volatility may spread beyond the U.K., and could be intensified by foreign exchange risks. These factors could contribute to weakening GDP growth, primarily in the U.K. and Europe. The magnitude and longevity of the potential negative economic impacts would depend on the detailed agreements reached by the U.K. and the EU as a result of the exit negotiations and negotiations regarding trade and other arrangements. 
  As a global insurance company, we are affected by the monetary policy of central banks around the world. The ECB has adopted stimulus measures which are intended to lessen the risk of a prolonged period of deflation and support economic recovery in the Euro zone. See    Industry Trends   Financial and Economic Environment  for further information on such measures, as well as for information regarding actions taken by Japan s central government and the Bank of Japan to boost inflation expectations and achieve sustainable economic growth in Japan. See also    Industry Trends   Impact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment  for information regarding the December 2015 action taken by the FOMC to raise the federal funds rate and its subsequent determinations to maintain it. The Federal Reserve may take further actions to influence interest rates in the future, which may have an impact on the pricing levels of risk-bearing investments and may adversely impact the level of product sales. 
  European Region Investments 
  We maintain general account investments in certain EU member states and other countries in the region that are not members of the EU (collectively, the  European Region ) to support our insurance operations and related policyholder liabilities in these countries and certain of our non-European Region operations invest in the region for diversification. In the European Region, we have proactively mitigated risk in both direct and indirect exposures by investing in a diversified portfolio of high quality investments with a focus on the higher-rated countries, including the U.K., Germany, France, the Netherlands, Poland, Norway and Sweden. The sovereign debt of these countries continues to maintain investment grade credit ratings from all major rating agencies. Our European Region fixed maturity and perpetual hybrid securities classified as non-redeemable preferred stock are invested in a diversified portfolio of primarily non-financial services securities. At   September 30, 2016  , our exposure to such securities in the European Region totaled   $40.7 billion  , at estimated fair value, of which   $9.1 billion   was in sovereign fixed maturity securities.

  Selected Country and Sector Investments 
  Recent country specific volatility due to local economic and/or political concerns, as well as recent weakness in certain sectors, has affected the performance of certain of our investments.

We have exposure to such volatility, as we maintain general account investments in the U.K., Turkey, Brazil, Russia, Puerto Rico, Jordan, Lebanon and Ukraine, as well as Europe s perimeter region and Cyprus, to support our insurance operations and related policyholder liabilities in these countries; and we also have exposure through our global portfolio diversification. Our exposure to sovereign fixed maturity securities and total fixed maturity securities of the U.K., Turkey, Brazil, Russia, Puerto Rico, Jordan, Lebanon and Ukraine totaled   $1.5 billion   and   $14.0 billion  , at estimated fair value, respectively, at   September 30, 2016  . Our exposure to Puerto Rico political subdivision fixed maturities is in the form of secured revenue securities and we have no general obligation securities. Our exposure to sovereign fixed maturity securities and total fixed maturity securities of Europe s perimeter region and Cyprus totaled   $241 million   and   $1.6 billion  , at estimated fair value, respectively, at   September 30, 2016  . Our exposure to both sovereign fixed maturity securities and total fixed maturity securities of Greece was less than   $1 million  , at estimated fair value, at   September 30, 2016  . See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Investments   Current Environment   Selected Country and Sector Investments  included in the   2015   Annual Report for further information by country. See    Mortgage Loans  for information about U.K. mortgage loan investments.  
  There has been an increased focus on energy sector and metals and mining sector investments as a result of lower energy, oil and commodity prices. Our net exposure to energy sector fixed maturity securities was   $10.1 billion   (comprised of fixed maturity securities of   $10.1 billion   at estimated fair value and related net written credit default swaps of   $35 million   at notional value), of which   80%   were investment grade, with unrealized gains of   $601 million   at   September 30, 2016  . Our net exposure to metals and mining sector fixed maturity securities was   $2.2 billion   (comprised of fixed maturity securities of   $2.2 billion   at estimated fair value and related net purchased credit default swaps of   $15 million   at notional value), of which   72%   were investment grade, with unrealized gains of   $147 million   at   September 30, 2016  . 
  We manage direct and indirect investment exposure in the selected countries, the energy sector and the metals and mining sector through fundamental credit analysis and we continually monitor and adjust our level of investment exposure. We do not expect that our general account investments in these countries, the energy sector or the metals and mining sector will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 
  Current Environment   Summary 
  All of these factors have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on the financial results of companies in the financial services industry, including MetLife. Such global economic conditions, as well as the global financial markets, continue to impact our net investment income, net investment gains (losses), net derivative gains (losses), level of unrealized gains (losses) within the various asset classes in our investment portfolio, and our level of investment in lower yielding cash equivalents, short-term investments and government securities. See    Industry Trends,  as well as  Risk Factors   Economic Environment and Capital Markets-Related Risks   We Are Exposed to Significant Global Financial and Capital Markets Risks Which May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity, and May Cause Our Net Investment Income to Vary from Period to Period  included in the   2015   Annual Report.

Investment Portfolio Results 
  The following yield table presents the yield and investment income (loss) for our investment portfolio for the periods indicated.     Yields are calculated using reported net investment income which is not adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.   As described below, this table reflects certain differences from the presentation of net investment income presented in the GAAP consolidated statements of operations. This yield table presentation is consistent with how we measure our investment performance for management purposes, and we believe it enhances understanding of our investment portfolio results. 

__________________ 
           (1) 
    Yields are calculated as investment income as a percent of average quarterly asset carrying values. Investment income excludes recognized gains and losses and reflects GAAP adjustments presented in footnote (5) below. Asset carrying values exclude unrealized gains (losses), collateral received in connection with our securities lending program, freestanding derivative assets, collateral received from derivative counterparties, the effects of consolidating certain variable interest entities ( VIEs ) under GAAP that are treated as consolidated securitization entities ( CSEs ) and contractholder-directed unit-linked investments. A yield is not presented for other invested assets, as it is not considered a meaningful measure of performance for this asset class. 
              (2) 
    Investment income (loss) includes amounts for FVO and trading securities of   $25 million   and   $41 million   for the   three months   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   ($35) million   and   $4 million   for the   three months   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.  
              (3) 
    Investment income from fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans includes prepayment fees. 
              (4) 
    Net investment income included in yield calculations include earned income on derivatives and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of investments or that are used to replicate certain investments, but do not qualify for hedge accounting ( investment hedge adjustments ).

  Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities AFS 
  The following table presents fixed maturity and equity securities available-for-sale ( AFS ) by type (public or private) and information about perpetual and redeemable securities held at: 

141 

     Table of Contents  

Perpetual securities are included within fixed maturity and equity securities. Upon acquisition, we classify perpetual securities that have attributes of both debt and equity as fixed maturity securities if the securities have an interest rate step-up feature which, when combined with other qualitative factors, indicates that the securities have more debt-like characteristics; while those with more equity-like characteristics are classified as equity securities. Many of such securities, commonly referred to as  perpetual hybrid securities,  have been issued by non-U.S. financial institutions that are accorded the highest two capital treatment categories by their respective regulatory bodies (i.e. core capital, or  Tier 1 capital  and perpetual deferrable securities, or  Upper Tier 2 capital ). 
  Redeemable preferred stock with a stated maturity is included within fixed maturity securities. These securities, which are commonly referred to as  capital securities,  primarily have cumulative interest deferral features and are primarily issued by U.S. financial institutions. 
  In connection with our investment management business, we manage privately-placed and infrastructure fixed maturity securities on behalf of institutional clients, which are unaffiliated investors. These privately-placed and infrastructure fixed maturity securities had an estimated fair value of   $7.9 billion   and   $6.1 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. These assets are not included in our interim condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  During the second quarter of 2016, we commenced management of below investment grade fixed maturity securities on behalf of institutional clients, which are unaffiliated investors. These fixed maturity securities had an estimated fair value of   $318 million   at   September 30, 2016  . These assets are not included in our interim condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Also in connection with our investment management business, we manage index investment portfolios that track the return of standard industry fixed income and equity market indices such as the Barclay s U.S. Aggregate Bond Index and S P 500        Index. These assets had an estimated fair value of   $27.3 billion   and   $26.0 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and are included within separate account assets in our interim condensed consolidated financial statements.

  Fair Value of Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities   AFS 
  Fixed maturity and equity securities AFS measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding fair value pricing sources are as follows at: 

See Note   9   of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the fixed maturity securities and equity securities AFS fair value hierarchy. 
  
   142 

     Table of Contents  

The     composition of fair value pricing sources for and significant changes in Level 3 securities at   September 30, 2016   are as follows: 
             
    The majority of the Level 3 fixed maturity and equity securities AFS were concentrated in three sectors: U.S. and foreign corporate securities and residential mortgage-backed securities ( RMBS ). 
                
    Level 3 fixed maturity securities are priced principally through market standard valuation methodologies, independent pricing services and, to a much lesser extent, independent non-binding broker quotations using inputs that are not market observable or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 fixed maturity securities consist of less liquid securities with very limited trading activity or where less price transparency exists around the inputs to the valuation methodologies. Level 3 fixed maturity securities include: sub-prime RMBS; certain below investment grade private securities and less liquid investment grade corporate securities (included in U.S. and foreign corporate securities); less liquid collateralized obligation asset-backed securities ( ABS  and foreign government securities. 
                
    During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , Level 3 fixed maturity securities increased by   $442 million  , or   2%  . The increase was driven by purchases in excess of sales and an increase in estimated fair value recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), partially offset by net transfers out of Level 3.  
                
    During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , Level 3 fixed maturity securities increased by   $790 million  , or   4%  .   The increase was driven by purchases in excess of sales and an increase in estimated fair value recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), partially offset by net transfers out of Level 3.    
     See Note   9   of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a rollforward of the fair value measurements for fixed maturity securities and equity securities AFS measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs; transfers into and/or out of Level 3; and further information about the valuation techniques and inputs by level by major classes of invested assets that affect the amounts reported above.

  Fixed Maturity Securities Credit Quality   Ratings 
  See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Investments   Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities AFS   Fixed Maturity Securities Credit Quality   Ratings  included in the   2015   Annual Report for a discussion of the credit quality ratings assigned by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations ( NRSRO ) and credit quality designations assigned by and methodologies used by the Securities Valuation Office of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC ) for fixed maturity securities. 
  The NAIC has adopted revised methodologies for certain structured securities comprised of non-agency RMBS, commercial mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS ) and ABS. The NAIC s objective with the revised methodologies for these structured securities was to increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses, and to use the improved assessment to determine a more appropriate capital requirement for such structured securities. The revised methodologies reduce regulatory reliance on rating agencies and allow for greater regulatory input into the assumptions used to estimate expected losses from structured securities. We apply the revised NAIC methodologies to structured securities held by MetLife, Inc. s insurance subsidiaries that maintain the NAIC statutory basis of accounting. The NAIC s present methodology is to evaluate structured securities held by insurers using the revised NAIC methodologies on an annual basis. If MetLife, Inc. s insurance subsidiaries acquire structured securities that have not been previously evaluated by the NAIC, but are expected to be evaluated by the NAIC in the upcoming annual review, an internally developed designation is used until a final designation becomes available. These revised NAIC designations may not correspond to NRSRO ratings.

U.S. and Foreign Corporate Fixed Maturity Securities 
  We maintain a diversified portfolio of corporate fixed maturity securities across industries and issuers. This portfolio does not have any exposure to any single issuer in excess of   1%   of total investments and the top ten holdings comprise   2%   of total investments at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The tables below present our U.S. and foreign corporate securities holdings by industry at: 

Structured Securities  
  We held   $73.3 billion   and   $65.8 billion   of structured securities, at estimated fair value, at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, as presented in the RMBS, ABS and CMBS sections below.

     Table of Contents  

Historically, we have managed our exposure to sub-prime RMBS holdings by: acquiring older vintage year securities that benefit from better underwriting, improved credit enhancement and higher levels of residential property price appreciation; reducing our overall exposure; stress testing the portfolio with severe loss assumptions; and closely monitoring the performance of the portfolio. Since 2012, we have increased our exposure by purchasing sub-prime RMBS at significant discounts to the expected principal recovery value of these securities. The estimated fair value of our sub-prime RMBS holdings purchased since 2012 was   $4.7 billion   and   $4.0 billion   with unrealized gains (losses) of   $38 million   and   $74 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

Overview of Fixed Maturity and Equity Security OTTI Losses Recognized in Earnings 
  Impairments of fixed maturity and equity securities were   $19 million   and   $178 million   for the   three months   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $34 million   and   $63 million   for the   three months   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. Impairments of fixed maturity securities were   $14 million   and   $106 million   for the   three months   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $27 million   and   $47 million   for the   three months   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. Impairments of equity securities were   $5 million   and   $72 million   for the   three months   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $7 million   and   $16 million   for the   three months   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  Credit-related impairments of fixed maturity securities were   $14 million   and   $95 million   for the   three months   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $27 million   and   $47 million   for the   three months   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  Explanations of changes in fixed maturity and equity securities impairments are as follows: 
  Three Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared with the   Three Months Ended     September 30, 2015 
  Overall OTTI losses recognized in earnings on fixed maturity and equity securities were   $19 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $34 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . The most significant decreases in OTTI losses were in U.S. and foreign corporate securities, which decreased   $20 million   in the current period, and the decrease in losses was concentrated in the consumer industry. 
  Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared with the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015 
  Overall OTTI losses recognized in earnings on fixed maturity and equity securities were   $178 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to   $63 million   in the prior period. The most significant increases in OTTI losses were in U.S. and foreign corporate securities and common stock, which comprised   $154 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $40 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . An increase of   $57 million   in OTTI losses on U.S. and foreign corporate securities was concentrated in the industrial industry and reflected the impact of lower oil prices on the energy sector. The increase in OTTI losses on common stock was   $57 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , and was also concentrated in the industrial industry and reflected the impact of lower oil prices on the energy sector. 
  Future Impairments 
  Future OTTI will depend primarily on economic fundamentals, issuer performance (including changes in the present value of future cash flows expected to be collected), and changes in credit ratings, collateral valuation, interest rates and credit spreads. If economic fundamentals deteriorate or if there are adverse changes in the above factors, OTTI may be incurred in upcoming periods. 
   
  FVO and Trading Securities 
  FVO and trading securities are primarily comprised of securities for which the FVO has been elected ( FVO securities ). FVO securities include certain fixed maturity and equity securities held-for-investment by the general account to support ALM strategies for certain insurance products and investments in certain separate accounts. FVO securities are primarily comprised of contractholder-directed investments supporting unit-linked variable annuity type liabilities which do not qualify for presentation as separate account summary total assets and liabilities. These investments are primarily mutual funds and, to a lesser extent, fixed maturity and equity securities, short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents. The investment returns on these investments inure to the contractholder and are offset by a corresponding change in policyholder account balances through interest credited to policyholder account balances. FVO securities also include securities held by CSEs. We previously maintained a trading securities portfolio, principally invested in fixed maturity securities, to support investment strategies that involved the active and frequent purchase and sale of actively traded securities and the execution of short sale agreements. In June 2016, we commenced a reinvestment of this portfolio into other asset classes. FVO and trading securities were   $14.7 billion   and   $15.0 billion   at estimated fair value, or 2.6% and   3.0%   of total cash and invested assets, at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. See Note   9   of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the FVO and trading securities fair value hierarchy and a rollforward of the fair value measurements for FVO and trading securities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs.

Securities Lending 
  We participate in a securities lending program whereby securities are loaned to third parties, primarily brokerage firms and commercial banks. We obtain collateral, usually cash, in an amount generally equal to 102% of the estimated fair value of the securities loaned, which is obtained at the inception of a loan and maintained at a level greater than or equal to 100% for the duration of the loan. We monitor the estimated fair value of the securities loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral obtained as necessary throughout the duration of the loan. Securities loaned under such transactions may be sold or re-pledged by the transferee. We are liable to return to our counterparties the cash collateral under our control. Security collateral on deposit from counterparties may not be sold or re-pledged, unless the counterparty is in default, and is not reflected in the consolidated financial statements. These transactions are treated as financing arrangements and the associated cash collateral liability is recorded at the amount of the cash received. 
  See    Liquidity and Capital Resources   The Company   Liquidity and Capital Uses   Securities Lending  and Note   7   of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our securities lending program. 
  Repurchase Agreement Transactions 
  We participate in short-term repurchase and reverse repurchase agreement transactions whereby fixed maturity securities are loaned to, and contemporaneously other fixed maturity securities are borrowed from, unaffiliated financial institutions. We obtain cash collateral in an amount greater than or equal to   95%   of the estimated fair value of the securities loaned, and pledge cash collateral in an amount generally equal to   98%   of the estimated fair value of the borrowed securities at the inception of the transaction. We monitor the estimated fair value of the securities loaned and borrowed on a daily basis with additional collateral obtained as necessary throughout the duration of the transaction. Securities loaned under such transactions may be sold or re-pledged by the transferee. Securities borrowed under such transactions may be re-pledged, and are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements. These transactions are treated as collateralized borrowing and lending and the Company has elected to offset amounts recognized as receivables and payables resulting from these transactions.  
  The Company also participates in other short-term repurchase agreements with unaffiliated financial institutions. Under these agreements, the Company lends fixed maturity securities and receives cash as collateral in an amount generally equal to 85% to 100% of the estimated fair value of the securities loaned at the inception of the transaction. The associated liability is recorded at the amount of cash received. The Company monitors the estimated fair value of the collateral and the securities loaned throughout the duration of the transaction and additional collateral is obtained as necessary. Securities loaned under such transactions may be sold or re-pledged by the transferee. 
  See Note   7   of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our repurchase and reverse repurchase agreement transactions, as well as our other short-term repurchase agreement transactions. 
   
  Mortgage Loans 
  Our mortgage loans are principally collateralized by commercial, agricultural and residential properties. Mortgage loans and the related valuation allowances are summarized as follows at: 

The information presented in the tables herein exclude mortgage loans where we elected the FVO. Such amounts are presented in Note   7   of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

     Table of Contents  

We diversify our mortgage loan portfolio by both geographic region and property type to reduce the risk of concentration. Of our commercial and agricultural mortgage loan portfolios,   85%   are collateralized by properties located in the U.S., with the remaining   15%   collateralized by properties located outside the U.S., which includes   6%   of properties located in the U.K., at   September 30, 2016  . The carrying value of our commercial and agricultural mortgage loans located in California, New York and Texas were   18%  ,   12%   and   8%  , respectively, of commercial and agricultural mortgage loans at   September 30, 2016  . Additionally, we manage risk when originating commercial and agricultural mortgage loans by generally lending up to   75%   of the estimated fair value of the underlying real estate collateral. 
  We manage our residential mortgage loan portfolio in a similar manner to reduce risk of concentration, with   91%   collateralized by properties located in the U.S., and the remaining   9%   collateralized by properties located outside the U.S., as of   September 30, 2016  . The carrying value of our residential mortgage loans located in California, Florida, and New York were   34%  ,   8%  , and   6%  , respectively, of residential mortgage loans at   September 30, 2016  .  
  In connection with our investment management business, we manage commercial mortgage loans on behalf of institutional clients, which are unaffiliated investors. These commercial mortgage loans had an estimated fair value of   $2.9 billion   and   $2.0 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

Mortgage Loan Credit Quality - Monitoring Process.     We monitor our mortgage loan investments on an ongoing basis, including a review of loans that are current, past due, restructured and under foreclosure. See Note   7     of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for tables that present mortgage loans by credit quality indicator, past due and nonaccrual mortgage loans, as well as impaired mortgage loans. See    Real Estate and Real Estate Joint Ventures  for real estate acquired through foreclosure. 
  We review our commercial mortgage loans on an ongoing basis. These reviews may include an analysis of the property financial statements and rent roll, lease rollover analysis, property inspections, market analysis, estimated valuations of the underlying collateral, loan-to-value ratios, debt service coverage ratios, and tenant creditworthiness. The monitoring process focuses on higher risk loans, which include those that are classified as restructured, delinquent or in foreclosure, as well as loans with higher loan-to-value ratios and lower debt service coverage ratios. The monitoring process for agricultural mortgage loans is generally similar, with a focus on higher risk loans, such as loans with higher loan-to-value ratios, including reviews on a geographic and sector basis. We also review our residential mortgage loans on an ongoing basis. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the   2015   Annual Report for information on our evaluation of residential mortgage loans and related valuation allowance methodology. 
  Loan-to-value ratios and debt service coverage ratios are common measures in the assessment of the quality of commercial mortgage loans. Loan-to-value ratios are a common measure in the assessment of the quality of agricultural mortgage loans. Loan-to-value ratios compare the amount of the loan to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. A loan-to-value ratio greater than 100% indicates that the loan amount is greater than the collateral value. A loan-to-value ratio of less than 100% indicates an excess of collateral value over the loan amount. Generally, the higher the loan-to-value ratio, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss. The debt service coverage ratio compares a property s net operating income to amounts needed to service the principal and interest due under the loan. Generally, the lower the debt service coverage ratio, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss. For our commercial mortgage loans, our average loan-to-value ratio was   52%   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   and our average debt service coverage ratio was   2.7x   and   2.6x   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Our debt service coverage ratio and the values utilized in calculating the ratio are updated annually, on a rolling basis, with a portion of the portfolio updated each quarter. Our loan-to-value ratio is routinely updated for all but the lowest risk loans as part of our ongoing review of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. For our agricultural mortgage loans, our average loan-to-value ratio was   42%   and 43% at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The values utilized in calculating the agricultural mortgage loan loan-to-value ratio are developed in connection with the ongoing review of the agricultural loan portfolio and are routinely updated. 
  Mortgage Loan Valuation Allowances  .   Our valuation allowances are established both on a loan specific basis for those loans considered impaired where a property specific or market specific risk has been identified that could likely result in a future loss, as well as for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics where a property specific or market specific risk has not been identified, but for which we expect to incur a loss. Accordingly, a valuation allowance is provided to absorb these estimated probable credit losses. 
  The determination of the amount of valuation allowances is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with our loan portfolios. Such evaluations and assessments are based upon several factors, including our experience with losses on loans, defaults and loss severity, and loss expectations for loans with similar risk characteristics. These evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available, which can cause the valuation allowances to increase or decrease over time as such evaluations are revised. Negative credit migration, including an actual or expected increase in the level of problem loans, will result in an increase in the valuation allowance. Positive credit migration, including an actual or expected decrease in the level of problem loans, will result in a decrease in the valuation allowance. 
  See Notes   7   and   9   of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information about how valuation allowances are established and monitored, activity in and balances of the valuation allowance, and the estimated fair value of impaired mortgage loans and related impairments included within net investment gains (losses) as of and for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
   
  Real Estate and Real Estate Joint Ventures 
  We diversify our real estate investments by both geographic region and property type to reduce risk of concentration. Of our real estate investments, excluding funds, 73% were located in the U.S., with the remaining 27% located outside the U.S., at   September 30, 2016  . The carrying value of our real estate investments, excluding funds, located in Japan, California and District of Columbia were   24%  , 17% and 9%, respectively, of total real estate investments, excluding funds, at   September 30, 2016  . Real estate funds, including those classified within Traditional, were 10% of our real estate investments, at September 30, 2016. The majority of these funds hold underlying real estate investments that are well diversified across the U.S.

  Derivative Risks 
  We are exposed to various risks relating to our ongoing business operations, including interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, credit and equity market.

  Fair Value Hierarchy 
  See Note   9   of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding fair value hierarchy. 
  The valuation of Level 3 derivatives involves the use of significant unobservable inputs and generally requires a higher degree of management judgment or estimation than the valuations of Level 1 and Level 2 derivatives. Although Level 3 inputs are unobservable, management believes they are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such instruments and are considered appropriate given the circumstances. The use of different inputs or methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair value of Level 3 derivatives and could materially affect net income. 
  Derivatives categorized as Level 3 at   September 30, 2016   include: interest rate forwards with maturities which extend beyond the observable portion of the yield curve; interest rate total return swaps with unobservable repurchase rates; foreign currency swaps and forwards with certain unobservable inputs, including the unobservable portion of the yield curve; credit default swaps priced using unobservable credit spreads, or that are priced through independent broker quotations; equity variance swaps with unobservable volatility inputs; and equity index options with unobservable correlation inputs. At   September 30, 2016  , less than 1% of the estimated fair value of our derivatives was priced through independent broker quotations. 
  See Note   9   of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a rollforward of the fair value measurements for derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs. 
  The gain (loss) on Level 3 derivatives primarily relates to interest rate total return swaps with unobservable repurchase rates, certain purchased equity index options that are valued using models dependent on an unobservable market correlation input, equity variance swaps that are valued using observable equity volatility data plus an unobservable equity variance spread and foreign currency swaps and forwards that are valued using an unobservable portion of the swap yield curves. Other significant inputs, which are observable, include equity index levels, equity volatility and the swap yield curves. We validate the reasonableness of these inputs by valuing the positions using internal models and comparing the results to broker quotations.

  Credit Risk 
  See Note   8   of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information about how we manage credit risk related to derivatives and for the estimated fair value of our net derivative assets and net derivative liabilities after the application of master netting agreements and collateral. 
  Our policy is not to offset the fair value amounts recognized for derivatives executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting agreement. This policy applies to the recognition of derivatives in the consolidated balance sheets, and does not affect our legal right of offset.

    At   September 30, 2016   there were no purchased credit default swaps held in relation to the trading portfolio. At   December 31, 2015   purchased credit default swaps held in relation to the trading portfolio amounted to $175 million in gross notional amount and ($2) million in estimated fair value. 
              (2) 
    At   September 30, 2016  , there were no written credit default swaps held in relation to the trading portfolio. At   December 31, 2015  , written credit default swaps held in relation to the trading portfolio amounted to $20 million in gross notional amount and ($2) million in estimated fair value.

The following table presents the gross gains, gross losses and net gain (losses) recognized in income for credit default swaps as follows: 

__________________ 
           (1) 
    Gains (losses) are reported in net derivative gains (losses), except for gains (losses) on the trading portfolio, which are reported in net investment income. 
              (2) 
    There were no gross gains and gross (losses) for purchased credit default swaps in the trading portfolio for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The gross gains and gross (losses) for purchased credit default swaps in the trading portfolio were $4 million and ($4) million, respectively, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The gross gains and gross (losses) for purchased credit default swaps in the trading portfolio were $4 million and ($1) million, respectively, for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   and $7 million and ($4) million, respectively, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
              (3) 
    There were no gross gains and gross (losses) for written credit default swaps in the trading portfolio for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The gross gains and gross (losses) for written credit default swaps in the trading portfolio were $3 million and ($3) million, respectively, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The gross gains and gross (losses) for written credit default swaps in the trading portfolio were $2 million and ($3) million for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   and $3 million and ($3) million, respectively, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
              (4) 
    Gains (losses) do not include earned income (expense) on credit default swaps. 
     The unfavorable change in net gains (losses) on purchased credit default swaps of $40 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 was due to credit spreads narrowing in the current period compared to the prior period on credit default swaps hedging certain bonds. The favorable change in net gains (losses) on written credit default swaps of $138 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 was due to credit spreads narrowing in the current period compared to the prior period on certain credit default swaps used as replications. 
  The unfavorable change in net gains (losses) on purchased credit default swaps of $60 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was due to credit spreads narrowing in the current period compared to the prior period on credit default swaps hedging certain bonds. The favorable change in net gains (losses) on written credit default swaps of $165 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was due to credit spreads narrowing in the current period compared to the prior period on certain credit default swaps used as replications. 
  The maximum amount at risk related to our written credit default swaps is equal to the corresponding gross notional amount. In a replication transaction, we pair an asset on our balance sheet with a written credit default swap to synthetically replicate a corporate bond, a core asset holding of life insurance companies. Replications are entered into in accordance with the guidelines approved by insurance regulators and are an important tool in managing the overall corporate credit risk within the Company. In order to match our long-dated insurance liabilities, we will seek to buy long-dated corporate bonds. In some instances, these may not be readily available in the market, or they may be issued by corporations to which we already have significant corporate credit exposure. For example, by purchasing Treasury bonds (or other high-quality assets) and associating them with written credit default swaps on the desired corporate credit name, we, at times, can replicate the desired bond exposures and meet our ALM needs. In addition, given the shorter tenor of the credit default swaps (generally five-year tenors) versus a long-dated corporate bond, we have more flexibility in managing our credit exposures.

  Collateral for Securities Lending, Repurchase Agreement Transactions, Third-Party Custodian Administered Repurchase Program and Derivatives 
  We participate in a securities lending program in the normal course of business for the purpose of enhancing the total return on our investment portfolio. Periodically, we receive non-cash collateral for securities lending from counterparties, which cannot be sold or re-pledged, and which has not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of this collateral was   $134 million   and   $50 million   at estimated fair value at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. See Note   7   of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and    Investments   Securities Lending,  as well as  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   Investments   Securities Lending Program  in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the   2015   Annual Report for discussion of our securities lending program, the classification of revenues and expenses, and the nature of the secured financing arrangement and associated liability.  
  We participate in repurchase and reverse repurchase agreement transactions. In connection with these transactions, we obtain fixed maturity securities as collateral from unaffiliated financial institutions, which can be re-pledged, and which have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of these securities and the amount which were re-pledged was   $306 million   and   $114 million  , respectively, at estimated fair value at   September 30, 2016  . We had no such securities as of   December 31, 2015  . See    Investments   Repurchase Agreement Transactions  and Note   7   of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and the classification of the associated net receivable/payable and expense. 
  We also participate in third-party custodian administered repurchase programs for the purpose of enhancing the total return on our investment portfolio. We loan certain of our fixed maturity securities to financial institutions and, in exchange, non-cash collateral is put on deposit by the financial institutions on our behalf with third-party custodians. The estimated fair value of securities loaned in connection with these transactions was   $347 million   and   $738 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Non-cash collateral on deposit with third-party custodians on our behalf was   $359 million   and   $781 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which cannot be sold or re-pledged, and which has not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. 
  We enter into derivatives to manage various risks relating to our ongoing business operations. We have non-cash collateral from counterparties for derivatives, which can be sold or re-pledged subject to certain constraints, and which has not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of this non-cash collateral was $  3.3 billion   and $  2.2 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

  Policyholder Liabilities 
  We establish, and carry as liabilities, actuarially determined amounts that are calculated to meet policy obligations or to provide for future annuity payments. Amounts for actuarial liabilities are computed and reported in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. For more details on Policyholder Liabilities, see  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates  included in the   2015   Annual Report. 
  Due to the nature of the underlying risks and the uncertainty associated with the determination of actuarial liabilities, we cannot precisely determine the amounts that will ultimately be paid with respect to these actuarial liabilities, and the ultimate amounts may vary from the estimated amounts, particularly when payments may not occur until well into the future. 
  We periodically review our estimates of actuarial liabilities for future benefits and compare them with our actual experience. We revise estimates, to the extent permitted or required under GAAP, if we determine that future expected experience differs from assumptions used in the development of actuarial liabilities. We charge or credit changes in our liabilities to expenses in the period the liabilities are established or re-estimated. If the liabilities originally established for future benefit payments prove inadequate, we must increase them. Such an increase could adversely affect our earnings and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
  We have experienced, and will likely in the future experience, catastrophe losses and possibly acts of terrorism, as well as turbulent financial markets that may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Due to their nature, we cannot predict the incidence, timing, severity or amount of losses from catastrophes and acts of terrorism, but we make broad use of catastrophic and non-catastrophic reinsurance to manage risk from these perils. 
  Insurance regulators in many of the non-U.S. countries in which we operate require certain MetLife entities to prepare a sufficiency analysis of the reserves presented in the locally required regulatory financial statements, and to submit that analysis to the regulatory authorities. See  Business   Regulation   U.S. Regulation   Insurance Regulation   Policy and Contract Reserve Adequacy Analysis  and  Business   Regulation   International Regulation  included in the   2015   Annual Report. 
   
  Future Policy Benefits 
  We establish liabilities for amounts payable under insurance policies. See Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the   2015   Annual Report for additional information. See also  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Industry Trends   Impact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment   Low Interest Rate Scenario  included in the   2015   Annual Report and    Variable Annuity Guarantees.  A discussion of future policy benefits by segment (as well as Corporate   Other) follows. 
  
   157 

     Table of Contents  

U.S.  
  Amounts payable under insurance policies for this segment are comprised of group insurance and annuities, as well as property   casualty policies. For group insurance, future policyholder benefits are comprised mainly of liabilities for disabled lives under disability waiver of premium policy provisions, liabilities for survivor income benefit insurance, active life policies and premium stabilization and other contingency liabilities held under life insurance contracts. For group annuity contracts, future policyholder benefits are primarily related to payout annuities, including pension risk transfers, structured settlement annuities and institutional income annuities. There is no interest rate crediting flexibility on these liabilities. As a result, a sustained low interest rate environment could negatively impact earnings; however, we mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies, including the use of various derivative positions, primarily interest rate floors and interest rate swaps. The components of future policy benefits our property   casualty policies are liabilities for unpaid claims, estimated based upon assumptions such as rates of claim frequencies, levels of severities, inflation, judicial trends, legislative changes or regulatory decisions. Assumptions are based upon our historical experience and analysis of historical development patterns of the relationship of loss adjustment expenses to losses for each line of business, and we consider the effects of current developments, anticipated trends and risk management programs, reduced for anticipated salvage and subrogation. 
  Asia 
  Future policy benefits for this segment are held primarily for traditional life, endowment, annuity and accident   health contracts. They are also held for total return pass-through provisions included in certain universal life and savings products. They include certain liabilities for variable annuity and variable life guarantees of minimum death benefits, and longevity guarantees. Factors impacting these liabilities include sustained periods of lower yields than rates established at policy issuance, lower than expected asset reinvestment rates, market volatility, actual lapses resulting in lower than expected income, and actual mortality or morbidity resulting in higher than expected benefit payments. We mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies. 
  Latin America 
  Future policy benefits for this segment are held primarily for immediate annuities in Chile, Argentina and Mexico and traditional life contracts mainly in Mexico, Brazil and Colombia. There are also liabilities held for total return pass-through provisions included in certain universal life and savings products in Mexico. Factors impacting these liabilities include sustained periods of lower yields than rates established at policy issuance, lower than expected asset reinvestment rates, and mortality and lapses different than expected. We mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies. 
  EMEA 
  Future policy benefits for this segment include unearned premium reserves for group life and credit insurance contracts. Future policy benefits are also held for traditional life, endowment and annuity contracts with significant mortality risk and accident   health contracts. Factors impacting these liabilities include lower than expected asset reinvestment rates, market volatility, actual lapses resulting in lower than expected income, and actual mortality or morbidity resulting in higher than expected benefit payments. We mitigate our risks by having premiums which are adjustable or cancellable in some cases, and by applying various ALM strategies. 
  MetLife Holdings 
  Future policy benefits for the life business are comprised mainly of liabilities for traditional life and for universal and variable life insurance contracts. In order to manage risk, we have often reinsured a portion of the mortality risk on life insurance policies. The reinsurance programs are routinely evaluated and this may result in increases or decreases to existing coverage. We have entered into various derivative positions, primarily interest rate swaps and swaptions, to mitigate the risk that investment of premiums received and reinvestment of maturing assets over the life of the policy will be at rates below those assumed in the original pricing of these contracts. For the annuities business, future policy benefits are comprised mainly of liabilities for life-contingent income annuities, and liabilities for the variable annuity guaranteed minimum benefits accounted for as insurance. Other future policyholder benefits are comprised mainly of liabilities for disabled lives under disability waiver of premium policy provisions, and active life policies. In addition, for our other products, future policyholder benefits related to the reinsurance of our former Japan joint venture are comprised of liabilities for the variable annuity guaranteed minimum benefits accounted for as insurance.

  Future policy benefits for the life business are comprised mainly of liabilities for traditional life and for universal and variable life insurance contracts. In order to manage risk, we have often reinsured a portion of the mortality risk on life insurance policies. The reinsurance programs are routinely evaluated and this may result in increases or decreases to existing coverage. We have entered into various derivative positions, primarily interest rate swaps and swaptions, to mitigate the risk that investment of premiums received and reinvestment of maturing assets over the life of the policy will be at rates below those assumed in the original pricing of these contracts. For the annuities business, future policy benefits are comprised mainly of liabilities for life-contingent income annuities, and liabilities for the variable annuity guaranteed minimum benefits accounted for as insurance. For our other products, future policyholder benefits are comprised mainly of group annuity contracts, primarily related to payout annuities, including pension risk transfers, structured settlement annuities and institutional income annuities. There is no interest rate crediting flexibility on these liabilities. As a result, a sustained low interest rate environment could negatively impact earnings; however, we mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies, including the use of various derivative positions, primarily interest rate floors and interest rate swaps. 
  Corporate   Other 
  Future policy benefits primarily include liabilities for the global employee benefits reinsurance business. Additionally, future policy benefits include liabilities for the U.S direct business sold directly to consumers. 
   
  Policyholder Account Balances 
  Policyholder account balances are generally equal to the account value, which includes accrued interest credited, but excludes the impact of any applicable charge that may be incurred upon surrender. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Industry Trends   Impact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment   Low Interest Rate Scenario  included in the   2015   Annual Report and    Variable Annuity Guarantees.  See also Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the   2015   Annual Report for additional information. A discussion of policyholder account balances by segment (as well as Corporate   Other) follows. 
  U.S.  
  Policyholder account balances in this segment are comprised of funding agreements, retained asset accounts, universal life policies, the fixed account of variable life insurance policies and specialized life insurance products for benefit programs.  
  Group Benefits 
  Policyholder account balances in this business are held for retained asset accounts, universal life policies, the fixed account of variable life insurance policies and specialized life insurance products for benefit programs. Policyholder account balances are credited interest at a rate we determine, which is influenced by current market rates. A sustained low interest rate environment could negatively impact earnings as a result of the minimum credited rate guarantees present in most of these policyholder account balances. We have various derivative positions, primarily interest rate floors, to partially mitigate the risks associated with such a scenario.

Policyholder account balances in this business are comprised of funding agreements. Interest crediting rates vary by type of contract, and can be fixed or variable. Variable interest crediting rates are generally tied to an external index, most commonly (1-month or 3-month) LIBOR. We are exposed to interest rate risks, as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk, when guaranteeing payment of interest and return of principal at the contractual maturity date. We may invest in floating rate assets or enter into receive-floating interest rate swaps, also tied to external indices, as well as caps, to mitigate the impact of changes in market interest rates. We also mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies and seek to hedge all foreign currency exchange rate risk through the use of foreign currency hedges, including cross currency swaps. 
  Asia 
  Policyholder account balances in this segment are held largely for fixed income retirement and savings plans, fixed deferred annuities, interest sensitive whole life products, universal life and, to a lesser degree, liability amounts for unit-linked-type funds that do not meet the GAAP definition of separate accounts. Also included are certain liabilities for retirement and savings products sold in certain countries in Asia that generally are sold with minimum credited rate guarantees. Liabilities for guarantees on certain variable annuities in Asia are accounted for as embedded derivatives and recorded at estimated fair value and are also included within policyholder account balances. These liabilities are generally impacted by sustained periods of low interest rates, where there are interest rate guarantees. We mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies and with reinsurance. Liabilities for unit-linked-type funds are impacted by changes in the fair value of the associated underlying investments, as the return on assets is generally passed directly to the policyholder. 
  The table below presents the breakdown of account value subject to minimum guaranteed crediting rates for Asia:

    Excludes negative VOBA liabilities of $1.1 billion at   September 30, 2016  , primarily held in Japan. These liabilities were established in instances where the estimated fair value of contract obligations exceeded the book value of assumed insurance policy liabilities associated with the acquisition of American Life Insurance Company ( American Life ) and Delaware American Life Insurance Company (collectively,  ALICO ). These negative liabilities were established primarily for decreased market interest rates subsequent to the issuance of the policy contracts.

     Latin America 
  Policyholder account balances in this segment are held largely for investment-type products and universal life products in Mexico and Chile, and deferred annuities in Brazil. Some of the deferred annuities in Brazil are unit-linked-type funds that do not meet the GAAP definition of separate accounts. The rest of the deferred annuities have minimum credited rate guarantees, and these liabilities and the universal life liabilities are generally impacted by sustained periods of low interest rates. Liabilities for unit-linked-type funds are impacted by changes in the fair value of the associated investments, as the return on assets is generally passed directly to the policyholder.

EMEA 
  Policyholder account balances in this segment are held mostly for universal life, deferred annuity, pension products, and unit-linked-type funds that do not meet the GAAP definition of separate accounts. They are also held for endowment products without significant mortality risk. Where there are interest rate guarantees, these liabilities are generally impacted by sustained periods of low interest rates. We mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies. Liabilities for unit-linked-type funds are impacted by changes in the fair value of the associated investments, as the return on assets is generally passed directly to the policyholder. 
  MetLife Holdings 
  Life policyholder account balances are held for retained asset accounts, universal life policies, the fixed account of variable life insurance policies, embedded derivatives related to the reinsurance of our former Japan joint venture, and funding agreements. For annuities, policyholder account balances are held for fixed deferred annuities, the fixed account portion of variable annuities, and non-life contingent income annuities. Interest is credited to the policyholder s account at interest rates we determine which are influenced by current market rates, subject to specified minimums. A sustained low interest rate environment could negatively impact earnings as a result of the minimum credited rate guarantees present in most of these policyholder account balances. We have various derivative positions, primarily interest rate floors, to partially mitigate the risks associated with such a scenario. Additionally, for our other products policyholder account balances are held for variable annuity guaranteed minimum living benefits that are accounted for as embedded derivatives.

    These amounts are not adjusted for policy loans. 
     As a result of acquisitions, we establish additional liabilities known as excess interest reserves for policies with credited rates in excess of market rates as of the applicable acquisition dates. At September 30, 2016, excess interest reserves were $424 million for the Brighthouse Financial segment.  
   
  Variable Annuity Guarantees  
  We issue, directly and through assumed business, certain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits that provide the policyholder a minimum return based on their initial deposit (i.e., the benefit base) less withdrawals. In some cases, the benefit base may be increased by additional deposits, bonus amounts, accruals or optional market value resets. See Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2015 Annual Report, as well as Note   4   of the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 
  Certain guarantees, including portions thereof, have insurance liabilities established that are included in future policy benefits. Guarantees accounted for in this manner include GMDBs, the life-contingent portion of certain guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit ( GMWBs ), and the non-life contingent portions of both GMWBs and GMIBs that require annuitization. These liabilities are accrued over the life of the contract in proportion to actual and future expected policy assessments based on the level of guaranteed minimum benefits generated using multiple scenarios of separate account returns. The scenarios are based on best estimate assumptions consistent with those used to amortize DAC. When current estimates of future benefits exceed those previously projected or when current estimates of future assessments are lower than those previously projected, liabilities will increase, resulting in a current period charge to net income. The opposite result occurs when the current estimates of future benefits are lower than those previously projected or when current estimates of future assessments exceed those previously projected. At each reporting period, we update the actual amount of business remaining in-force, which impacts expected future assessments and the projection of estimated future benefits resulting in a current period charge or increase to earnings. 
  Certain guarantees, including portions thereof, accounted for as embedded derivatives, are recorded at estimated fair value and included in policyholder account balances. Guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives include guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits ( GMABs ), and the non-life contingent portions of both GMWBs and GMIBs that do not require annuitization. The estimated fair values of guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives are determined based on the present value of projected future benefits minus the present value of projected future fees. The projections of future benefits and future fees require capital market and actuarial assumptions including expectations concerning policyholder behavior. A risk neutral valuation methodology is used to project the cash flows from the guarantees under multiple capital market scenarios to determine an economic liability. The reported estimated fair value is then determined by taking the present value of these risk-free generated cash flows using a discount rate that incorporates a spread over the risk-free rate to reflect our nonperformance risk and adding a risk margin. For more information on the determination of estimated fair value, see Note   9   of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

     Table of Contents  

The table below contains the carrying value for guarantees at:  

The carrying amounts for guarantees included in policyholder account balances above include nonperformance risk adjustments of $1,700 million and $462 million at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. These nonperformance risk adjustments represent the impact of including a credit spread when discounting the underlying risk neutral cash flows to determine the estimated fair values. The nonperformance risk adjustment does not have an economic impact on us as it cannot be monetized given the nature of these policyholder liabilities. The change in valuation arising from the nonperformance risk adjustment is not hedged. 
  The carrying values of these guarantees can change significantly during periods of sizable and sustained shifts in equity market performance, equity volatility, interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates. Carrying values are also impacted by our assumptions around mortality, separate account returns and policyholder behavior, including lapse rates. 
  As discussed below, we use a combination of product design, hedging strategies, reinsurance, and other risk management actions to mitigate the risks related to these benefits. Within each type of guarantee, there is a range of product offerings reflecting the changing nature of these products over time. Changes in product features and terms are in part driven by customer demand but, more importantly, reflect our risk management practices of continuously evaluating the guaranteed benefits and their associated asset-liability matching. Recently, we have been diversifying the concentration of income benefits in the portfolio of the Company s annuities business by focusing on withdrawal benefits, variable annuities without living benefits and index-linked annuities. To this end, the GMIBs were no longer available for new purchases after February 19, 2016. 
  The sections below provide further detail by total account value for certain of our most popular guarantees. Total account values include amounts not reported in the consolidated balance sheets from assumed business, contractholder-directed investments which do not qualify for presentation as separate account assets, and amounts included in our general account. The total account values and the net amounts at risk include direct and assumed business, but exclude offsets from hedging or ceded reinsurance, if any.

GMDBs 
  We offer a range of GMDBs to our contractholders. The table below presents GMDBs, by benefit type, at   September 30, 2016  :

           (1) 
    Total account value excludes $2.2 billion for contracts with no GMDBs. Further, many of our annuity contracts offer more than one type of guarantee such that GMDB amounts listed above are not mutually exclusive to the amounts in the living benefit guarantees table below. 
     Based on total account value, less than   39  % of our GMDBs included enhanced death benefits such as the annual step-up or roll-up and step-up combination products. We expect the above GMDB risk profile to be relatively consistent for the foreseeable future.

              (2) 
    The Asia and EMEA segments include the non-life contingent portion of the GMWB total account value of $1,125 million with a guarantee at annuitization. 
     In terms of total account value, GMIBs are our most significant living benefit guarantee. Our primary risk management strategy for our GMIB products is our derivatives hedging program as discussed below. Additionally, we have engaged in certain reinsurance agreements covering some of our GMIB business. As part of our overall risk management approach for living benefit guarantees, we continually monitor the reinsurance markets for the right opportunity to purchase additional coverage for our GMIB business.

The table below presents our GMIB associated total account values, by their guaranteed payout basis, at   September 30, 2016  : 

The annuitization interest rates on GMIBs have been decreased from 2.5% to 0.5% over time, partially in response to the low interest rate environment, accompanied by an increase in the setback period from seven years to 10 years and the introduction of a 10-year mortality projection. 
  Additionally, 33% of the $91.1 billion of GMIB total account value has been invested in managed volatility funds as of   September 30, 2016  . These funds seek to manage volatility by adjusting the fund holdings within certain guidelines based on capital market movements. Such activity reduces the overall risk of the underlying funds while maintaining their growth opportunities. These risk mitigation techniques translate to a reduction or elimination of the need for us to manage the funds  volatility through hedging or reinsurance. 
  Our GMIB products typically have a waiting period of 10 years to be eligible for annuitization. As of   September 30, 2016  , only 17% of our contracts with GMIBs were eligible for annuitization. The remaining contracts are not eligible for annuitization for an average of six years. 
  Once eligible for annuitization, contractholders would only be expected to annuitize if their contracts were in-the-money. We calculate in-the-moneyness with respect to GMIBs consistent with net amount at risk as discussed in Note   4   of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, by comparing the contractholders  income benefits based on total account values and current annuity rates versus the guaranteed income benefits. The net amount at risk was $4,663 million at   September 30, 2016  , of which $4,423 million was related to GMIB guarantees. For those contracts with GMIB, the table below presents details of contracts that are in-the-money and out-of-the-money at   September 30, 2016  : 

Derivatives Hedging Variable Annuity Guarantees 
  Our risk mitigating hedging strategy uses various over-the-counter and exchange traded derivatives. The table below presents the gross notional amount, estimated fair value and primary underlying risk exposure of the derivatives hedging our variable annuity guarantees: 
  
   165 

     Table of Contents  

The change in estimated fair values of our derivatives is recorded in policyholder benefits and claims if such derivatives are hedging guarantees included in future policy benefits, and in net derivative gains (losses) if such derivatives are hedging guarantees included in policyholder account balances. 
  Our hedging strategy involves the significant use of static longer-term derivative instruments to avoid the need to execute transactions during periods of market disruption or higher volatility. We continually monitor the capital markets for opportunities to adjust our liability coverage, as appropriate. Futures are also used to dynamically adjust the daily coverage levels as markets and liability exposures fluctuate. 
  We remain liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event that reinsurers or derivative counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay. Certain of our reinsurance agreements and most derivative positions are collateralized and derivatives positions are subject to master netting agreements, both of which significantly reduce the exposure to counterparty risk. In addition, we are subject to the risk that hedging and other risk management actions prove ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder behavior or mortality, combined with adverse market events, produces economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
   
  Overview 
  Our business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally. Stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in global capital markets, particular markets, or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on us, in part because we have a large investment portfolio and our insurance liabilities are sensitive to changing market factors. The global markets and economy continue to experience volatility that may affect our financing costs and market interest for our debt or equity securities. For further information regarding market factors that could affect our ability to meet liquidity and capital needs, see    Industry Trends  and    Investments   Current Environment.  
  Liquidity Management 
  Based upon the strength of our franchise, diversification of our businesses, strong financial fundamentals and the substantial funding sources available to us as described herein, we continue to believe we have access to ample liquidity to meet business requirements under current market conditions and reasonably possible stress scenarios. We continuously monitor and adjust our liquidity and capital plans for MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries in light of market conditions, as well as changing needs and opportunities. 
  Short-term Liquidity 
  We maintain a substantial short-term liquidity position, which was $12.0 billion and $11.1 billion at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Short-term liquidity includes cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed, including those in connection with securities lending, repurchase agreements, derivatives, the closed block and secured borrowings. 
  
   166 

     Table of Contents  

Liquid Assets 
  An integral part of our liquidity management includes managing our level of liquid assets, which was $248.7 billion and $229.4 billion at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and publicly-traded securities, excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed. Assets pledged or otherwise committed include those in connection with securities lending, repurchase agreements, derivatives, the closed block, regulatory deposits and custodial accounts, collateral financing agreements, funding agreements and secured borrowings. 
  Capital Management 
  We have established several senior management committees as part of our capital management process. These committees, including the Capital Management Committee and the Enterprise Risk Committee ( ERC ), regularly review actual and projected capital levels (under a variety of scenarios including stress scenarios) and our annual capital plan in accordance with our capital policy. The Capital Management Committee is comprised of members of senior management, including MetLife, Inc. s Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Chief Risk Officer ( CRO ). The ERC is also comprised of members of senior management, including MetLife, Inc. s Chief Financial Officer, CRO and Chief Investment Officer. 
  Our Board and senior management are directly involved in the development and maintenance of our capital policy. The capital policy sets forth, among other things, minimum and target capital levels and the governance of the capital management process. All capital actions, including proposed changes to the annual capital plan, capital targets or capital policy, are reviewed by the Finance and Risk Committee of the Board prior to obtaining full Board approval. The Board approves the capital policy and the annual capital plan and authorizes capital actions, as required.

  The Company 
  Liquidity 
  Liquidity refers to a company s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs. In the event of significant cash requirements beyond anticipated liquidity needs, we have various alternatives available depending on market conditions and the amount and timing of the liquidity need. These available alternatives include cash flows from operations, sales of liquid assets, global funding sources and various credit facilities. 
  Capital 
  We manage our capital position to maintain our financial strength and credit ratings. Our capital position is supported by our ability to generate strong cash flows within our operating companies and borrow funds at competitive rates, as well as by our demonstrated ability to raise additional capital to meet operating and growth needs despite adverse market and economic conditions.

Summary of the Company s Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital 
  Our primary sources and uses of liquidity and capital are summarized as follows: 

Cash Flows from Operations 
  The principal cash inflows from our insurance activities come from insurance premiums, net investment income, annuity considerations and deposit funds. The principal cash outflows relate to various life insurance, property   casualty, annuity and pension products, operating expenses and income tax, as well as interest expense. A primary liquidity concern with respect to these cash flows is the risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal. 
  Cash Flows from Investments 
  The principal cash inflows from our investment activities come from repayments of principal, proceeds from maturities and sales of investments and settlements of freestanding derivatives. The principal cash outflows relate to purchases of investments, issuances of policy loans and settlements of freestanding derivatives. Additional cash outflows relate to purchases of businesses. We typically have a net cash outflow from investing activities because cash inflows from insurance operations are reinvested in accordance with our ALM discipline to fund insurance liabilities. We closely monitor and manage these risks through our comprehensive investment risk management process. The primary liquidity concerns with respect to these cash flows are the risk of default by debtors and market disruption. 
  
   168 

     Table of Contents  

Cash Flows from Financing 
  The principal cash inflows from our financing activities come from issuances of debt and other securities, deposits of funds associated with policyholder account balances and lending of securities. The principal cash outflows come from repayments of debt, payments of dividends on and repurchases of MetLife, Inc. s securities, withdrawals associated with policyholder account balances and the return of securities on loan. The primary liquidity concerns with respect to these cash flows are market disruption and the risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal. 
  Liquidity and Capital Sources 
  In addition to the general description of liquidity and capital sources in    Summary of the Company s Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital,  the following additional information is provided regarding our primary sources of liquidity and capital: 
  Global Funding Sources 
  Liquidity is provided by a variety of global funding sources, including funding agreements, credit facilities and commercial paper. Capital is provided by a variety of global funding sources, including short-term and long-term debt, collateral financing arrangements, junior subordinated debt securities, preferred securities, equity securities and equity-linked securities. The diversity of our global funding sources enhances our funding flexibility, limits dependence on any one market or source of funds and generally lowers the cost of funds. Our primary global funding sources include: 
  Common Stock 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , MetLife, Inc. issued   2,403,270   and   5,312,287   new shares of its common stock for   $94 million   and   $208 million  , respectively, to satisfy various stock option exercises and other stock-based awards. 
  Commercial Paper, Reported in Short-term Debt 
  MetLife, Inc. and MetLife Funding, Inc. ( MetLife Funding ) each have a commercial paper program that is supported by the $4.0 billion general corporate credit facility (see    Credit and Committed Facilities ). MetLife Funding raises cash from its commercial paper program and uses the proceeds to extend loans through MetLife Credit Corp., another subsidiary of MLIC, to affiliates in order to enhance the financial flexibility and liquidity of these companies. 
  Federal Home Loan Bank Funding Agreements, Reported in Policyholder Account Balances 
  Certain of our domestic insurance subsidiaries are members of a regional Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ). During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we issued $14.2 billion and $16.5 billion, respectively, and repaid $12.6 billion and $16.0 billion, respectively, under funding agreements with certain regional FHLBs. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , total obligations outstanding under these funding agreements were $17.1 billion and $15.5 billion, respectively. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the   2015   Annual Report. 
  Special Purpose Entity Funding Agreements, Reported in Policyholder Account Balances 
  We issue fixed and floating rate funding agreements, which are denominated in either U.S. dollars or foreign currencies, to certain special purpose entities ( SPEs ) that have issued either debt securities or commercial paper for which payment of interest and principal is secured by such funding agreements. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we issued $30.8 billion and $35.5 billion, respectively, and repaid $33.5 billion and $38.2 billion, respectively, under such funding agreements. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , total obligations outstanding under these funding agreements were $29.5 billion and $31.6 billion, respectively. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the   2015   Annual Report.

Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Funding Agreements, Reported in Policyholder Account Balances 
  We have issued funding agreements to a subsidiary of the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation ( Farmer Mac ), as well as to certain SPEs that have issued debt securities for which payment of interest and principal is secured by such funding agreements, and such debt securities are also guaranteed as to payment of interest and principal by Farmer Mac. The obligations under all such funding agreements are secured by a pledge of certain eligible agricultural real estate mortgage loans. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we issued $1.2 billion and $50 million, respectively, and repaid $1.0 billion and $250 million, respectively, under such funding agreements. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , total obligations outstanding under these funding agreements were $2.7 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the   2015   Annual Report. 
  Credit and Committed Facilities 
   At   September 30, 2016  , we maintained a $4.0 billion unsecured credit facility and certain committed facilities aggregating $11.6 billion. When drawn upon, these facilities bear interest at varying rates in accordance with the respective agreements. 
  The unsecured credit facility is used for general corporate purposes, to support the borrowers  commercial paper programs and for the issuance of letters of credit. At   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding $711 million in letters of credit and no drawdowns against this facility. Remaining availability was $3.3 billion at   September 30, 2016  . 
  The committed facilities are used for collateral for certain of our affiliated reinsurance liabilities. At   September 30, 2016  , $6.2 billion in letters of credit and $2.8 billion in aggregate drawdowns under collateral financing arrangements were outstanding. Remaining availability was $2.6 billion at   September 30, 2016  . 
  See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the   2015   Annual Report for further information about these facilities. 
  We have no reason to believe that our lending counterparties will be unable to fulfill their respective contractual obligations under these facilities. As commitments associated with letters of credit and financing arrangements may expire unused, these amounts do not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements.

Dispositions 
  Cash proceeds from dispositions during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were $291 million and $0, respectively. See        Executive Summary     Consolidated Company Outlook,           Executive Summary       Other Key Information       Significant Events  and   Note 3   of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
  Liquidity and Capital Uses 
  In addition to the general description of liquidity and capital uses in    Summary of the Company s Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital,  the following additional information is provided regarding our primary uses of liquidity and capital: 
  Common Stock Repurchases 
  Utilizing authorizations from the MetLife, Inc. Board of Directors, MetLife, Inc. may purchase its common stock from the MetLife Policyholder Trust, in the open market (including pursuant to the terms of a pre-set trading plan meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act )) and in privately negotiated transactions. See  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds   Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.  
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , MetLife, Inc. repurchased   1,445,864   shares and   22,475,816   shares of common stock in the open market purchases for   $70 million   and   $1.1 billion  , respectively.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , MetLife, Inc. had no remaining common stock repurchase authorizations. Common stock repurchases are dependent upon several factors, including our capital position, liquidity, financial strength and credit ratings, general market conditions, the market price of MetLife, Inc. s common stock compared to management s assessment of the stock s underlying value and applicable regulatory approvals, as well as other legal and accounting factors. See  Business   Regulation   U.S. Regulation   Regulation as a Non-Bank SIFI  in the 2015 Annual Report, as amended or supplemented in our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q under the caption  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Industry Trends   Regulatory Developments  and similarly named sections under the caption  Risk Factors  and    Industry Trends   Regulatory Developments   International Regulation   Global Systemically Important Insurers.  See also  Risk Factors   Capital-Related Risks   Regulatory Restrictions and Uncertainty and Restrictions Under the Terms of Certain of Our Securities May Prevent Us from Repurchasing Our Stock and Paying Dividends at the Level We   Wish  in the 2015 Annual Report, as amended or supplemented in our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q in similarly named sections under the caption  Risk Factors  and Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the   2015   Annual Report. 
  Preferred Stock Dividends 
  Information on the declaration, record and payment dates, as well as per share and aggregate dividend amounts, for MetLife, Inc. s preferred stock was as follows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

171 

     Table of Contents  

Preferred stock dividends are paid quarterly in accordance with the terms of MetLife, Inc. s Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A. Dividends for the Series B preferred stock, which was redeemed in 2015, ended with the June 15, 2015 payment date. Dividends are paid semi-annually in accordance with the terms of MetLife, Inc. s Series C preferred stock, commencing December 15, 2015 and ending on June 15, 2020 and, thereafter, will be paid quarterly.  
  Common Stock Dividends 
  Information on the declaration, record and payment dates, as well as per share and aggregate dividend amounts, for MetLife, Inc. s common stock was as follows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

The declaration and payment of common stock dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, and will depend on MetLife, Inc. s financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, future prospects, regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by MetLife, Inc. s insurance subsidiaries and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. See Note   16   of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding a common stock dividend declared subsequent to   September 30, 2016  .  
  Dividend Restrictions 
  If MetLife, Inc. were re-designated as a non-bank SIFI, the payment of dividends and other distributions by MetLife, Inc. to its security holders may be subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve. See  Business   Regulation  U.S. Regulation   Regulation as a Non-Bank SIFI.  in the 2015 Annual Report, as amended or supplemented in our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q under the caption  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Industry Trends   Regulatory Developments  and similarly named sections under the caption  Risk Factors.  In addition, if additional capital requirements are imposed on MetLife, Inc. as a G-SII, its ability to pay dividends could be reduced by any such additional capital requirements that might be imposed. See    Industry Trends   Regulatory Developments   International Regulation   Global Systemically Important Insurers.  The payment of dividends is also subject to restrictions under the terms of our preferred stock and junior subordinated debentures in situations where we may be experiencing financial stress. See  Risk Factors   Capital-Related Risks   Regulatory Restrictions and Uncertainty and Restrictions Under the Terms of Certain of Our Securities May Prevent Us from Repurchasing Our Stock and Paying Dividends at the Level We Wish  in the 2015 Annual Report, as amended or supplemented in our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q in similarly named sections under the caption  Risk Factors  and Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the   2015   Annual Report. 
  Debt Repayments 
  In June 2016, MetLife, Inc. repaid at maturity its $1.3 billion 6.750% senior notes. 
  In 2016, following regulatory approval, MetLife Reinsurance Company of Charleston, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc., repurchased and canceled $55 million in aggregate principal amount of its surplus notes, which were reported in collateral financing arrangements on the consolidated balance sheet.

     Table of Contents  

Debt Repurchases 
  We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Any such repurchases or exchanges will be dependent upon several factors, including our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, general market conditions, and applicable regulatory, legal and accounting factors. Whether or not to repurchase any debt and the size and timing of any such repurchases will be determined at our discretion. 
  Support Agreements 
  MetLife, Inc. and several of its subsidiaries (each, an  Obligor ) are parties to various capital support commitments and guarantees with subsidiaries. Under these arrangements, each Obligor, with respect to the applicable entity, has agreed to cause such entity to meet specified capital and surplus levels or has guaranteed certain contractual obligations. We anticipate that in the event that these arrangements place demands upon us, there will be sufficient liquidity and capital to enable us to meet anticipated demands. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Liquidity and Capital Resources   MetLife, Inc.   Liquidity and Capital Uses   Support Agreements  included in the   2015   Annual Report. 
  Insurance Liabilities 
  Liabilities arising from our insurance activities primarily relate to benefit payments under various life insurance, property   casualty, annuity and group pension products, as well as payments for policy surrenders, withdrawals and loans. For annuity or deposit type products, surrender or lapse behavior differs somewhat by segment. In the MetLife Holdings and Brighthouse Financial segments, which include individual annuities, lapses and surrenders tend to occur in the normal course of business. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , general account surrenders and withdrawals from annuity products were $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. In the Retirement   Income Solutions business within the U.S. segment, which includes pension risk transfers, bank-owned life insurance and other fixed annuity contracts, as well as funding agreements and other capital market products, most of the products offered have fixed maturities or fairly predictable surrenders or withdrawals. With regard to the Retirement   Income Solutions business liabilities that provide customers with limited rights to accelerate payments, at   September 30, 2016   there were no funding agreements or other capital market products that could be put back to the Company. 
  Pledged Collateral 
  We pledge collateral to, and have collateral pledged to us by, counterparties in connection with our derivatives. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had received cash collateral of   $12.3 billion   and $6.6 billion, respectively. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had pledged cash collateral of   $441 million   and $241 million, respectively. With respect to OTC-bilateral derivatives in a net liability position that have credit contingent provisions, a one-notch downgrade in the Company s credit or financial strength rating, as applicable, would have required   $2 million   of additional collateral be provided to our counterparties as of   September 30, 2016  . See Note   8   of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about collateral pledged to us, collateral we pledge and derivatives subject to credit contingent provisions. 
  We pledge collateral and have had collateral pledged to us, and may be required from time to time to pledge additional collateral or be entitled to have additional collateral pledged to us, in connection with collateral financing arrangements related to the reinsurance of closed block and universal life secondary guarantee liabilities. 
  We pledge collateral from time to time in connection with funding agreements. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the   2015   Annual Report. 
  Securities Lending 
  We participate in a securities lending program whereby securities are loaned to third parties, primarily brokerage firms and commercial banks. We obtain collateral, usually cash, from the borrower, which must be returned to the borrower when the loaned securities are returned to us. Under our securities lending program, we were liable for cash collateral under our control of   $32.1 billion   and $30.2 billion at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Of these amounts,   $8.4 billion   and $10.1 billion at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, were on open, meaning that the related loaned security could be returned to us on the next business day requiring the immediate return of cash collateral we hold. The estimated fair value of the securities on loan related to the cash collateral on open at   September 30, 2016   was   $8.1 billion  , over   99%   of which were U.S. government and agency securities which, if put to us, could be immediately sold to satisfy the cash requirements to immediately return the cash collateral. See   Note 7   of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Litigation 
  Putative or certified class action litigation and other litigation, and claims and assessments against us, in addition to those discussed elsewhere herein and those otherwise provided for in the consolidated financial statements, have arisen in the course of our business, including, but not limited to, in connection with our activities as an insurer, employer, investor, investment advisor, taxpayer and, formerly, a mortgage lending bank. Further, state insurance regulatory authorities and other federal and state authorities regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations concerning our compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and regulations. See Note   15   of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  We establish liabilities for litigation and regulatory loss contingencies when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. For material matters where a loss is believed to be reasonably possible but not probable, no accrual is made but we disclose the nature of the contingency and an aggregate estimate of the reasonably possible range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, when such an estimate can be made. It is not possible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of all pending investigations and legal proceedings. In some of the matters referred to herein, very large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages, are sought. Although in light of these considerations, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a material adverse effect upon our financial position, based on information currently known by us, in our opinion, the outcome of such pending investigations and legal proceedings are not likely to have such an effect. However, given the large and/or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods. 
  Acquisitions 
  There were no acquisitions during either of the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   or   2015  . 
  Contractual Obligations 
  See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Liquidity and Capital Resources   The Company   Contractual Obligations  included in the   2015   Annual Report for additional information regarding the Company s contractual obligations. 
   
  MetLife, Inc. 
  Liquidity and Capital Management 
  Liquidity and capital are managed to preserve stable, reliable and cost-effective sources of cash to meet all current and future financial obligations and are provided by a variety of sources, including a portfolio of liquid assets, a diversified mix of short- and long-term funding sources from the wholesale financial markets and the ability to borrow through credit and committed facilities. Liquidity is monitored through the use of internal liquidity risk metrics, including the composition and level of the liquid asset portfolio, timing differences in short-term cash flow obligations, access to the financial markets for capital and debt transactions and exposure to contingent draws on MetLife, Inc. s liquidity. MetLife, Inc. is an active participant in the global financial markets through which it obtains a significant amount of funding. These markets, which serve as cost-effective sources of funds, are critical components of MetLife, Inc. s liquidity and capital management. Decisions to access these markets are based upon relative costs, prospective views of balance sheet growth and a targeted liquidity profile and capital structure. A disruption in the financial markets could limit MetLife, Inc. s access to liquidity. 
  MetLife, Inc. s ability to maintain regular access to competitively priced wholesale funds is fostered by its current credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies. We view our capital ratios, credit quality, stable and diverse earnings streams, diversity of liquidity sources and our liquidity monitoring procedures as critical to retaining such credit ratings. 
  See    Executive Summary   Consolidated Company Outlook  for a discussion of expected impacts to liquidity and capital resources in connection with the Separation including incremental sources of liquidity and capital from subsidiary dividends that we expect to receive from Brighthouse Financial (expected to be partially funded from the issuance of debt by Brighthouse Financial) and a MetLife-affiliated reinsurance subsidiary, and proceeds over time from the disposition of our retained shares of Brighthouse common stock, as well as incremental uses of liquidity and capital from foregone subsidiary dividends and foregone incremental debt issuances and ongoing uses of liquidity and capital from the repayment of debt maturities.

Capital

For further information regarding potential capital restrictions and limitations on MetLife, Inc. as a non-bank SIFI and G-SII, see  Business   Regulation   U.S. Regulation   Regulation as a Non-Bank SIFI  and  Business   Regulation   International Regulation   Global Systemically Important Insurers  included in the   2015   Annual Report, as amended or supplemented in our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q under the caption  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Industry Trends   Regulatory Developments  and similarly named sections under the caption  Risk Factors.  See also    The Company   Liquidity and Capital Uses   Common Stock Repurchases  for information regarding MetLife, Inc. s common stock repurchases. 
  Liquid Assets 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , MetLife, Inc. and other MetLife holding companies had $5.6 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively, in liquid assets. Of these amounts, $4.1 billion and $5.3 billion were held by MetLife, Inc. and $1.5 billion and $1.1 billion were held by other MetLife holding companies, at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and publicly-traded securities excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed. Assets pledged or otherwise committed include those in connection with derivatives and collateral financing arrangements. 
  Liquid assets held in non-U.S. holding companies are generated in part through dividends from non-U.S. insurance operations. Such dividends are subject to local insurance regulatory requirements, as discussed in    Liquidity and Capital Sources   Dividends from Subsidiaries.  The cumulative earnings of certain active non-U.S. operations have been reinvested indefinitely in such non-U.S. operations, as described in Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the   2015   Annual Report. Under current tax laws, should we repatriate such earnings, we may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. 
  See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Liquidity and Capital Resources   MetLife, Inc.   Liquid Assets  included in the   2015   Annual Report for additional information on the sources and uses of liquid assets for MetLife, Inc. and other MetLife holding companies. See also    Executive Summary   Consolidated Company Outlook  for the targeted level of liquid assets at the holding companies following the Separation. 
  Liquidity and Capital Sources 
  In addition to the description of liquidity and capital sources in    The Company   Summary of the Company s Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital  and    The Company   Liquidity and Capital Sources,  the following additional information is provided regarding MetLife, Inc. s primary sources of liquidity and capital: 
  Dividends from Subsidiaries 
  MetLife, Inc. relies, in part, on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its cash requirements. MetLife, Inc. s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends imposed by the regulators of their respective domiciles. The dividend limitation for U.S. insurance subsidiaries is generally based on the surplus to policyholders at the end of the immediately preceding calendar year and statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year. Statutory accounting practices, as prescribed by insurance regulators of various states in which we conduct business, differ in certain respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP. The significant differences relate to the treatment of DAC, certain deferred income tax, required investment liabilities, statutory reserve calculation assumptions, goodwill and surplus notes.

           (1) 
    Reflects dividend amounts that may be paid during   2016   without prior regulatory approval. However, because dividend tests may be based on dividends previously paid over rolling 12-month periods, if paid before a specified date during 2016, some or all of such dividends may require regulatory approval. 
              (2) 
    Reflects revised interpretation of statutory dividend limits from amount reported in the   2015   Annual Report.  
     In addition to the amounts presented in the table above, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , MetLife, Inc. received cash of $100 million from certain of its other subsidiaries, of which $20 million represented a dividend and $80 million represented a return of capital. 
  The dividend capacity of our non-U.S. operations is subject to similar restrictions established by the local regulators. The non-U.S. regulatory regimes also commonly limit the dividend payments to the parent to a portion of the prior year s statutory income, as determined by the local accounting principles. The regulators of our non-U.S. operations, including Japan s Financial Services Agency, may also limit or not permit profit repatriations or other transfers of funds to the U.S. if such transfers are deemed to be detrimental to the solvency or financial strength of the non-U.S. operations, or for other reasons. Most of the non-U.S. subsidiaries are second tier subsidiaries which are owned by various non-U.S. holding companies. The capital and rating considerations applicable to the first tier subsidiaries may also impact the dividend flow into MetLife, Inc. 
  We actively manage target and excess capital levels and dividend flows on a proactive basis and forecast local capital positions as part of the financial planning cycle. The dividend capacity of certain U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries is also subject to business targets in excess of the minimum capital necessary to maintain the desired rating or level of financial strength in the relevant market. We cannot provide assurance that MetLife, Inc. s subsidiaries will have statutory earnings to support payment of dividends to MetLife, Inc. in an amount sufficient to fund its cash requirements and pay cash dividends and that the applicable regulators will not disapprove any dividends that such subsidiaries must submit for approval. See  Risk Factors   Capital-Related Risks   As a Holding Company, MetLife, Inc. Depends on the Ability of Its Subsidiaries to Pay Dividends, a Major Component of Holding Company Free Cash Flow  included in the   2015   Annual Report and Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the   2015   Annual Report. 
  Short-term Debt 
  MetLife, Inc. maintains a commercial paper program, the proceeds of which can be used to finance the general liquidity needs of MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries. MetLife, Inc. had no short-term debt outstanding at either   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
  Maturity and Issuance of Affiliated Long-term Debt 
  In September 2016, a $250 million senior note issued to MLIC matured and, subsequently, in September 2016 MetLife, Inc. issued a new $250 million senior note to MLIC. The $250 million senior note matures in September 2020 and bears interest at a rate per annum of 3.03%, payable semi-annually.  
  Credit and Committed Facilities 
  In June 2016, MetLife, Inc. entered into a five-year agreement with an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, MetLife Ireland Treasury Limited ( MITL ), to borrow up to $1.25 billion on a revolving basis, at interest rates based on the Internal Revenue Service safe harbor interest rate in effect at the time of the borrowing. MetLife, Inc. may borrow funds under the agreement at MITL s discretion and subject to the availability of funds. There were no outstanding borrowings at   September 30, 2016  .

See    The Company   Liquidity and Capital Sources   Global Funding Sources   Credit and Committed Facilities  for information about MetLife, Inc. s unsecured credit facility. 
  MetLife, Inc. maintains a committed facility with a capacity of $425 million. At   September 30, 2016  , MetLife, Inc. had outstanding $425 million in letters of credit, no drawdowns outstanding and no remaining availability with this facility. In addition, MetLife, Inc. is a party and/or guarantor to committed facilities of certain of its subsidiaries, which aggregated $11.2 billion, for which there was $5.8 billion in letters of credit outstanding and $2.8 billion in aggregate drawdowns at   September 30, 2016  . The committed facilities are used as collateral for certain of the Company s affiliated reinsurance liabilities. 
  See    The Company   Liquidity and Capital Sources   Global Funding Sources   Credit and Committed Facilities  for further information regarding these facilities. 
  Long-term Debt Outstanding 
  The following table summarizes the outstanding long-term debt of MetLife, Inc. at: 

__________________ 
   Debt and Facility Covenants 
  Certain of MetLife, Inc. s debt instruments and committed facilities, as well as its credit facility, contain various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. MetLife, Inc. believes it was in compliance with all applicable covenants at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Dispositions 
  Cash proceeds from dispositions during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were $291 million and $0, respectively. 
  Liquidity and Capital Uses 
  The primary uses of liquidity of MetLife, Inc. include debt service, cash dividends on common and preferred stock, capital contributions to subsidiaries, common and preferred stock repurchases, payment of general operating expenses and acquisitions. Based on our analysis and comparison of our current and future cash inflows from the dividends we receive from subsidiaries that are permitted to be paid without prior insurance regulatory approval, our investment portfolio and other cash flows and anticipated access to the capital markets, we believe there will be sufficient liquidity and capital to enable MetLife, Inc. to make payments on debt, pay cash dividends on its common and preferred stock, contribute capital to its subsidiaries, repurchase its common and preferred stock, pay all general operating expenses and meet its cash needs. 
  In addition to the description of liquidity and capital uses in    The Company   Liquidity and Capital Uses,  the following additional information is provided regarding MetLife, Inc. s primary uses of liquidity and capital: 
  Affiliated Capital and Debt Transactions 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , MetLife, Inc. invested a net amount of $1.3 billion and $230 million, respectively, in various subsidiaries. The investment in the first quarter of 2016 included a cash capital contribution of $1.5 billion to MetLife USA. 
  MetLife, Inc. lends funds, as necessary, to its subsidiaries and affiliates, some of which are regulated, to meet their capital requirements. MetLife, Inc. had loans to subsidiaries outstanding of $1.2 billion at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  In April 2016, American Life issued a $140 million short-term note to MetLife, Inc. which was repaid in June 2016. The short-term note bore interest at six-month LIBOR plus 1.00%.

See    Results of Operations  for reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable historical GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is not accessible on a forward-looking basis because we believe it is not possible without unreasonable efforts to provide other than a range of net investment gains and losses and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly within or outside the range and from period to period and may have a material impact on net income. 
  Our definitions of the various non-GAAP and other financial measures discussed in this report may differ from those used by other companies: 
  Operating earnings and related measures: 
             
    operating earnings; and 
                
    operating earnings available to common shareholders. 
     These measures are used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, operating earnings is also our GAAP measure of segment performance. Operating earnings and other financial measures based on operating earnings are also the measures by which senior management s and many other employees  performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans. Operating earnings and other financial measures based on operating earnings allow analysis of our performance relative to our business plan and facilitate comparisons to industry results.  
  Operating earnings is defined as operating revenues less operating expenses, both net of income tax. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends.

Operating revenues and operating expenses  
  These financial measures focus on our primary businesses principally by excluding the impact of market volatility, which could distort trends, and revenues and costs related to non-core products and divested businesses and certain entities required to be consolidated under GAAP. Also, these measures exclude results of discontinued operations and other businesses that have been or will be sold or exited by MetLife and are referred to as divested businesses. In addition, for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , operating revenues and operating expenses exclude the financial impact of converting the Company s Japan operations to calendar year-end reporting without retrospective application of this change to prior periods and is referred to as lag elimination. Operating revenues also excludes net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses). Operating expenses also excludes goodwill impairments. 
  The following additional adjustments are made to revenues, in the line items indicated, in calculating operating revenues: 
             
    Universal life and investment-type product policy fees excludes the amortization of unearned revenue related to net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses) and certain variable annuity GMIB fees ( GMIB Fees  
                
    Net investment income: (i) includes investment hedge adjustments, (ii) excludes post-tax operating earnings adjustments relating to insurance joint ventures accounted for under the equity method, (iii) excludes certain amounts related to contractholder-directed unit-linked investments, and (iv) excludes certain amounts related to securitization entities that are VIEs consolidated under GAAP; and 
                
    Other revenues are adjusted for settlements of foreign currency earnings hedges. 
     The following additional adjustments are made to expenses, in the line items indicated, in calculating operating expenses: 
             
    Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends excludes: (i) changes in the policyholder dividend obligation related to net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses), (ii) inflation-indexed benefit adjustments associated with contracts backed by inflation-indexed investments and amounts associated with periodic crediting rate adjustments based on the total return of a contractually referenced pool of assets and other pass through adjustments (also known as asymmetrical and non-economic accounting for insurance contracts), (iii) benefits and hedging costs related to GMIBs ( GMIB Costs ), and (iv) market value adjustments associated with surrenders or terminations of contracts ( Market Value Adjustments  
                
    Interest credited to policyholder account balances includes adjustments for earned income on derivatives and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of policyholder account balances but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and excludes amounts related to net investment income earned on contractholder-directed unit-linked investments; 
                
    Amortization of DAC and VOBA excludes amounts related to: (i) net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses), (ii) GMIB Fees and GMIB Costs, and (iii) Market Value Adjustments; 
                
    Amortization of negative VOBA excludes amounts related to Market Value Adjustments; 
                
    Interest expense on debt excludes certain amounts related to securitization entities that are VIEs consolidated under GAAP; and 
                
    Other operating expenses excludes costs related to: (i) noncontrolling interests, (ii) implementation of new insurance regulatory requirements, and (iii) acquisition, integration and other costs. 
     Operating earnings also excludes the recognition of certain contingent assets and liabilities that could not be recognized at acquisition or adjusted for during the measurement period under GAAP business combination accounting guidance.  
  The tax impact of the adjustments mentioned are calculated net of the U.S. or foreign statutory tax rate, which could differ from the Company s effective tax rate. Additionally, the provision for income tax (expense) benefit also includes the impact related to the timing of certain tax credits, as well as certain tax reforms. 
  Return on equity, allocated equity and related measures: 
             
    Operating ROE is defined as operating earnings available to common shareholders, divided by average GAAP common stockholders  equity. 
                
    Operating ROE, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, is defined as operating earnings available to common shareholders divided by average GAAP common stockholders  equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA. 
     The above measures represent a level of equity consistent with the view that, in the ordinary course of business, we do not plan to sell most investments for the sole purpose of realizing gains or losses.

The following additional information is relevant to an understanding of our performance results: 
             
    The impact of changes in our foreign currency exchange rates is calculated using the average foreign currency exchange rates for the current period and is applied to each of the comparable periods ( Constant Currency Basis ). 
                
    We sometimes refer to sales activity for various products. These sales statistics do not correspond to revenues under GAAP, but are used as relevant measures of business activity. Further, sales statistics for our Latin America, Asia and EMEA segments are on a Constant Currency Basis. 
                
    Allocated equity is the portion of MetLife, Inc. s common stockholders  equity that management allocates to each of its segments and sub-segments based on local capital requirements and economic capital. See    Economic Capital.  Allocated equity excludes the impact of AOCI other than FCTA. 
                
    The Company uses a measure of free cash flow to facilitate an understanding of its ability to generate cash for reinvestment into its businesses or use in discretionary capital actions. The Company defines free cash flow as the sum of cash available at MetLife s holding companies from dividends from operating subsidiaries, expenses and other net flows of the holding companies, and net contributions from debt to be at or below target leverage ratios. This measure of free cash flow is prior to discretionary capital deployment, including common stock dividends and repurchases, debt reduction and mergers and acquisitions. Free cash flow should not be viewed as a substitute for net cash provided by (used in) operating activities calculated in accordance with GAAP. The free cash flow ratio is typically expressed as a percentage of annual operating earnings available to common shareholders.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  We regularly analyze our exposure to interest rate, equity market price and foreign currency exchange rate risks. As a result of that analysis, we have determined that the estimated fair values of certain assets and liabilities are materially exposed to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the equity markets. We have exposure to market risk through our insurance operations and investment activities. We use a variety of strategies to manage interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and equity market risk, including the use of derivatives. A description of our market risk exposures may be found under  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  in Part II, Item 7A, of the   2015   Annual Report. There have been no material changes to our market risk exposures from the market risk exposures previously disclosed in the   2015   Annual Report.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
  There were no changes to the Company s internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

  Asbestos-Related Claims 
  MLIC is and has been a defendant in a large number of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts. These suits principally allege that the plaintiff or plaintiffs suffered personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos and seek both actual and punitive damages.  
  As reported in the 2015 Annual Report, MLIC received approximately 3,856 asbestos-related claims in 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, MLIC received approximately 3,267 and 2,971 new asbestos-related claims, respectively. See Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2015 Annual Report for historical information concerning asbestos claims and MLIC s increase in its recorded liability at December 31, 2014. The number of asbestos cases that may be brought, the aggregate amount of any liability that MLIC may incur, and the total amount paid in settlements in any given year are uncertain and may vary significantly from year to year. 
  MLIC reevaluates on a quarterly and annual basis its exposure from asbestos litigation, including studying its claims experience, reviewing external literature regarding asbestos claims experience in the United States, assessing relevant trends impacting asbestos liability and considering numerous variables that can affect its asbestos liability exposure on an overall or per claim basis. These variables include bankruptcies of other companies involved in asbestos litigation, legislative and judicial developments, the number of pending claims involving serious disease, the number of new claims filed against it and other defendants and the jurisdictions in which claims are pending. Based upon its regular reevaluation of its exposure from asbestos litigation, MLIC has updated its liability analysis for asbestos-related claims through September 30, 2016. 
  Unclaimed Property Litigation  
  West Virginia Lawsuits 
  On September 20, 2012, the West Virginia Treasurer filed an action against MLIC in West Virginia state court     (West Virginia ex rel. John D. Perdue v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, Circuit Court of Putnam County, Civil Action No. 12-C-295)     alleging that MLIC violated the West Virginia Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (the  Act ), seeking to compel compliance with the Act, and seeking payment of unclaimed property, interest, and penalties. On November 14, 2012, November 21, 2012, December 28, 2012, and January 9, 2013, the Treasurer filed substantially identical suits against MetLife Investors USA, NELICO, MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut and General American Life Insurance Company, respectively. On August 17, 2016, these companies and the West Virginia Treasurer reached an agreement in principle to resolve these actions. 
  City of Birmingham Retirement and Relief System v. MetLife, Inc., et al. (Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Alabama, filed July 5, 2012) 
  Seeking to represent a class of persons who purchased MetLife, Inc. common equity units in or traceable to a public offering in March 2011, the plaintiff filed an action alleging that MetLife, Inc., certain current and former directors and executive officers of MetLife, Inc., and various underwriters violated several provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 related to the filing of the registration statement by issuing, or causing MetLife, Inc. to issue, materially false and misleading statements and/or omissions concerning MetLife, Inc. s potential liability for millions of dollars in insurance benefits that should have been paid to beneficiaries or escheated to the states. Plaintiff seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. On October 14, 2015, the court denied the defendants  motion to dismiss the complaint. On October 28, 2016, the parties signed a stipulation of settlement agreeing to resolve this action. Plaintiff is seeking court approval of this settlement.

Total Control Accounts Litigation 
  Owens v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (N.D. Ga., filed April 17, 2014) 
  Plaintiff filed this putative class action lawsuit on behalf of all persons for whom MLIC established a retained asset account, known as a total control account ( TCA ), to pay death benefits under an ERISA plan. The action alleges that MLIC s use of the TCA as the settlement option for life insurance benefits under some group life insurance policies violates MLIC s fiduciary duties under ERISA. As damages, plaintiff seeks disgorgement of profits that MLIC realized on accounts owned by members of the putative class. On September 27, 2016 the court denied MLIC s summary judgment     motion in full and granted plaintiff s partial summary judgment motion. The Company intends to defend this action vigorously. 
  Diversified Lending Group Litigations 
  Hartshorne v. MetLife Inc., et al. (Los Angeles County Superior Court, filed March 25, 2015) 
  Plaintiffs have named MetLife, Inc., MSI and NELICO in 12 related lawsuits in California state court alleging various causes of action including multiple negligence and statutory claims relating to a Ponzi scheme involving the Diversified Lending Group ( DLG ). In August 2016, a trial of claims by one of the plaintiffs, Christine Ramirez, resulted in a verdict against MetLife, Inc., MSI, and NELICO for approximately $200 thousand in compensatory damages and $15 million in punitive damages. The Company intends to appeal this verdict. 
  Other Litigation  
  Fauley v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, et al. (Circuit Court of the 19th Judicial Circuit, Lake County, Ill., July 3, 2014) 
  Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit against defendants, including MLIC and a former MetLife financial services representative, alleging that the defendants sent unsolicited fax advertisements to plaintiff and others in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, as amended by the Junk Fax Prevention Act, 47 U.S.C.   227. The court issued a final order certifying a nationwide settlement class and approving a settlement under which MLIC has agreed to pay up to $23 million to resolve claims as to fax advertisements sent between August 23, 2008 and August 7, 2014. On March 23, 2016, the intermediate appellate court affirmed the trial court s order. On September 28, 2016, the Illinois Supreme Court denied an objector s petition for leave to appeal. 
  Thrivent Financial for Lutherans v. MetLife Insurance Company USA, (E.D. Wis., filed September 12, 2016) 
  Plaintiff filed a complaint against MetLife USA contending that MetLife s use of the Brighthouse Financial trademark and logo will infringe on its trademarks. Alleging violations of federal and state law, plaintiff seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, compensatory damages, and other relief. MetLife USA intends to defend this action vigorously. 
  Summary 
  Putative or certified class action litigation and other litigation and claims and assessments against the Company, in addition to those discussed previously and those otherwise provided for in the Company s consolidated financial statements, have arisen in the course of the Company s business, including, but not limited to, in connection with its activities as an insurer, mortgage lending bank, employer, investor, investment advisor and taxpayer. Further, state insurance regulatory authorities and other federal and state authorities regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations concerning the Company s compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and regulations. 
  It is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of all pending investigations and legal proceedings. In some of the matters referred to previously, very large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages, are sought. Although in light of these considerations it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a material effect upon the Company s financial position, based on information currently known by the Company s management, in its opinion, the outcomes of such pending investigations and legal proceedings are not likely to have such an effect. However, given the large and/or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material effect on the Company s consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.

  Our Insurance and Brokerage Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth 
  Our insurance operations and brokerage businesses are subject to a wide variety of insurance and other laws and regulations. See  Business   Regulation  included in the 2015 Annual Report, as amended or supplemented by discussions of regulatory developments elsewhere herein and in our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q under the caption  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Industry Trends   Regulatory Developments,  and as further amended or supplemented below. 
  U.S. Regulation 
  ERISA Considerations 
  We provide products and services to certain employee benefit plans that are subject to ERISA or the Code. As such, our activities are subject to the restrictions imposed by ERISA and the Code, including the requirement under ERISA that fiduciaries must perform their duties solely in the interests of ERISA plan participants and beneficiaries, and those fiduciaries may not cause a covered plan to engage in certain prohibited transactions. The prohibited transaction rules of ERISA and the Code generally restrict the provision of investment advice to ERISA plans and participants and IRAs if the investment recommendation results in fees paid to the individual advisor, the firm that employs the advisor or their affiliates that vary according to the investment recommendation chosen. Similarly, without an exemption, fiduciary advisors are prohibited from receiving compensation from third parties in connection with their advice. ERISA also affects certain of our in-force insurance policies and annuity contracts, as well as insurance policies and annuity contracts we may sell in the future. 
  The DOL issued new regulations on April 6, 2016 with an effective date for most provisions of April 10, 2017. These regulations substantially expand the definition of  investment advice  and thereby broaden the circumstances under which MetLife or its representatives, in providing investment advice with respect to ERISA plans, plan participants or IRAs, will be deemed a fiduciary under ERISA or the Code. Pursuant to the final regulations, certain communications with plans, plan participants and IRAs holders, including the marketing of products, and marketing of investment management or advisory services, could be deemed fiduciary investment advice, thus causing increased exposure to fiduciary liability if the distributor does not recommend what is in the client s best interests. While the final regulations also provide that, to a limited extent, contracts sold and advice provided prior to April 10, 2017 do not have to be modified to comply with the new investment advice regulations, there is lack of clarity surrounding some of the conditions for qualifying for this limited exception. There can be no assurance that the DOL will agree with our interpretation of these provisions, in which case the DOL and IRS could assess significant penalties against a portion of products sold prior to April 10, 2017. The assessment of such penalties could also trigger substantial litigation risk. Any such penalties and related litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  
  The DOL also issued amendments to certain of its prohibited transaction exemptions, and issued a new exemption that applies more onerous disclosure and contract requirements to, and increases fiduciary requirements and fiduciary liability exposure in respect of, transactions involving ERISA plans, plan participants and IRAs.  
  
   185 

     Table of Contents  

While we continue to analyze the impact of the final regulations on our business, we believe they could have an adverse effect on sales of annuity products to ERISA qualified plans such as IRAs through our independent distribution partners. The new regulations deem advisors, including independent distributors, who sell fixed index-linked annuities to IRAs, IRA rollovers or 401(k) plans, fiduciaries and prohibit them from receiving compensation unless they comply with a prohibited transaction exemption. The exemption requires advisors to comply with impartial conduct standards and may require us to exercise additional oversight of the sales process. Compliance with the prohibited transaction exemption will likely result in increased regulatory burdens on us and our independent distribution partners, changes to our compensation practices and product offerings and increased litigation risk, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Industry Trends   Regulatory Developments   U.S. Regulation   ERISA Considerations,  as well as  Business   Regulation   U.S. Regulation   ERISA Considerations  included in the 2015 Annual Report. 
  We cannot predict what other proposals may be made, what legislation may be introduced or enacted, or what impact any such legislation may have on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
   
  Risks Related to Acquisitions, Dispositions or Other Structural Changes 
  We May Not Complete the Separation of Brighthouse Financial on the Terms or Timeline Currently Contemplated, if at All  
  On October 5, 2016, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Brighthouse, filed a registration statement on Form 10 with the SEC in connection with the previously announced Separation of a substantial portion of our former Retail segment, as well as certain portions of our former Corporate Benefit Funding segment. The Form 10 reflects our current plan to initiate the Separation in the form of an initial spin-off of 80.1% of the outstanding common stock of Brighthouse. While we and Brighthouse are currently preparing for a spin-off transaction, the ultimate form and timing of a separation will be influenced by a number of factors, including regulatory considerations and economic conditions. We continue to evaluate and pursue structural alternatives for the proposed Separation. While we expect to complete the first part of the Separation in the first half of 2017, unanticipated developments could delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect the currently proposed spin-off of Brighthouse Financial, including possible problems or delays in obtaining various insurance and other regulatory approvals, tax approvals and disruptions in the capital and financial markets. In addition, consummation of the currently proposed spin-off will require final approval from our Board of Directors. Therefore, we cannot assure that we will complete the Separation in the form, on the terms or on the timeline that we announced, if at all. 
  In order to position ourselves for the proposed Separation, we are actively pursuing strategic, structural and process realignment and restructuring actions within our former Retail segment (now, the Brighthouse Financial and MetLife Holdings segments). These actions could lead to disruption of our operations, loss of, or inability to recruit, key personnel needed to operate and grow our businesses and complete the proposed Separation, weakening of our internal standards, controls or procedures, and impairment of our relationship with key customers and counterparties. We have and will continue to incur significant expenses in connection with the proposed Separation. We also may not achieve certain of the benefits that we expect to achieve in connection with the Separation, including dividends from Brighthouse to MetLife, Inc., due to, among other things, the inability of Brighthouse to raise sufficient funds by the incurrence of debt or otherwise, or lower than expected dividends received by Brighthouse from its subsidiaries. In addition, completion of the proposed Separation will require significant amounts of our management s time and effort which may divert management s attention from operating and growing our remaining businesses and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
   
  Risks Related to Our Business 
  The following updates and replaces the similar paragraphs in the risk factor entitled  Our International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and Other Risks, Including Exposure to Local and Regional Economic Conditions, That Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our Profitability  included in the 2015 Annual Report, as amended or supplemented by such information in the First Quarter 2016 Report and the Second Quarter 2016 Report.

Our International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and Other Risks, Including Exposure to Local and Regional Economic Conditions, That Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our Profitability 
  Our international operations face political, legal, financial, operational and other risks. These operations may be materially adversely affected by the actions and decisions of foreign authorities and regulators, such as through nationalization or expropriation of assets; the imposition of limits on foreign ownership of local companies which may increase our dependence on joint venture counterparties and/or impact how we account for our joint venture ownership interests; changes in laws (including tax laws and regulations), their application or interpretation; political instability (including any resulting economic or trade sanctions); dividend limitations; price controls; changes in applicable currency; currency exchange controls or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which they operate or converting local currencies we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies, as well as other adverse actions by foreign governmental authorities and regulators, such as the retroactive application of new requirements on our current and prior activities or operations and the imposition of regulations limiting our ability to distribute our products. Such actions may negatively affect our business in these jurisdictions and could indirectly affect our business in other jurisdictions as well. Some of our foreign insurance operations are, and are likely to continue to be, in emerging markets where these risks are heightened. For example, proposed reform of the Chilean pension system, if enacted, may have a significant adverse effect on our business in Chile. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations     Industry Trends   Regulatory Developments   International Regulation.  
  On June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum regarding its membership in the EU, resulting in a narrow vote in favor of leaving the EU. The U.K. subsequently indicated that it will initiate the withdrawal process by the end of March 2017. The member withdrawal provisions in the applicable EU treaty have not been used before so it is unclear how the provisions will work in practice. Assuming the U.K. initiates the withdrawal process by giving notice that it is withdrawing from the EU, the relevant treaty provides that the U.K. and the EU will negotiate a withdrawal agreement during a maximum two-year period (unless such period is extended by unanimous vote of the other EU member states). It is currently anticipated that the withdrawal agreement would deal with the details of the immediate exit but would not set out final trade arrangements or deal comprehensively with other potentially significant matters. Upon effectiveness of the withdrawal agreement, or, if no agreement is concluded in the two-year period, at the end of the period, the U.K. will no longer be a member of the EU. In the meantime, however, the U.K. remains a member of the EU with unchanged rights to access the single EU market in goods and services. Our U.K. business model utilizes certain rights to operate cross-border insurance and investment operations which may be modified or eliminated as a result of the U.K. exiting the EU. Operating expenses within our businesses could increase as a result of uncertainties during the negotiation period and in the event of an eventual U.K. withdrawal. 
   
  Operational Risks 
  Any Failure To Protect The Confidentiality Of Client Information Could Adversely Affect Our Reputation And Have A Material Adverse Effect On Our Business, Financial Condition And Results Of Operations 
  Pursuant to U.S. federal and state laws, and laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate, various government agencies have established rules protecting the privacy and security of personal information. In addition, most U.S. states and a number of jurisdictions outside the United States, have enacted laws, which vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, to safeguard the privacy and security of personal information. Many of our employees have access to, and routinely process, personal information of clients through a variety of media, including information technology systems. We rely on various internal processes and controls to protect the confidentiality of client information that is accessible to, or in the possession of, our company and our employees. It is possible that an employee could, intentionally or unintentionally, disclose or misappropriate confidential client information or our data could be the subject of a cybersecurity attack. If we fail to maintain adequate internal controls or if our employees fail to comply with our policies and procedures, misappropriation or intentional or unintentional inappropriate disclosure or misuse of client information could occur. Such internal control inadequacies or non-compliance could materially damage our reputation or lead to civil or criminal penalties, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we analyze customer data to better manage our business. There has been increased scrutiny, including from U.S. state regulators, regarding the use of  big data  techniques such as price optimization. We cannot predict what, if any, actions may be taken with regard to  big data,  but any inquiries could cause reputational harm and any limitations could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

    During the periods July 1 through July 31, 2016, August 1 through August 31, 2016 and September 1 through   September 30, 2016  , separate account index funds purchased   0   shares,   0   shares and   781   shares, respectively, of common stock on the open market in nondiscretionary transactions. Except for the foregoing, there were no shares of common stock which were repurchased by MetLife, Inc. 
              (2) 
    At   September 30, 2016  , MetLife, Inc. had no remaining authorizations approved by its Board of Directors to purchase shares of common stock. Common stock repurchases, if and when authorized by the Board of Directors, are dependent upon several factors, including our capital position, liquidity, financial strength and credit ratings, general market conditions, the market price of MetLife, Inc. s common stock compared to management s assessment of the stock s underlying value and applicable regulatory approvals, as well as other legal and accounting factors. See  Risk Factors   Capital-Related Risks   Regulatory Restrictions and Uncertainty and Restrictions Under the Terms of Certain of Our Securities May Prevent Us from Repurchasing Our Stock and Paying Dividends at the Level We Wish  included in the 2015 Annual Report, as amended or supplemented in our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q in similarly named sections under the caption  Risk Factors,  as well as Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the   2015   Annual Report.
