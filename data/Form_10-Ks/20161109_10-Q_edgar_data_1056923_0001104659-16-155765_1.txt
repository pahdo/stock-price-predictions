  1.             Basis of Presentation  
     
  We have prepared the interim consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q without an audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  We have condensed or omitted certain information and footnote disclosures, normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, pursuant to such rules and regulations.  You should read these consolidated financial statements in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
     
  The consolidated financial statements presented herein as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, reflect, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (which consist only of normal, recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Management makes estimates and assumptions affecting the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses we report and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements.  The results of the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year.  Accordingly, you should read these consolidated financial statements in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Actual results could differ materially from these estimates and assumptions.  
     
   Recently Issued Accounting Standards   
     
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-15,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ), seeking to eliminate diversity in practice related to how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in ASU 2016-15 address eight specific cash flow issues and apply to all entities, including both business entities and not-for-profit entities that are required to present a statement of cash flows under FASB Accounting Standards Codification (FASB ASC) 230, Statement of Cash Flows. The amendments in ASU 2016-15 are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We are in the process of determining our implementation approach for this standard and assessing the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In April 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-10,  Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  ( ASU 2016-10 ). ASU 2016-10 clarifies, among other things, the accounting guidance in ASU 2014-09 regarding how an entity will determine whether promised goods or services are separately identifiable, which is an important consideration in determining whether to account for goods or services as a separate performance obligation. In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   Principal versus Agent Considerations  ( ASU 2016-08 ). ASU 2016-08 clarifies the implementation guidance for principal versus agent considerations in ASU 2014-09. We must adopt ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-08 with ASU 2014-09. The provisions of ASU 2014-09 are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We are in the process of determining our implementation approach for this standard and assessing the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ), which amends ASC Topic 718, Compensation   Stock Compensation. ASU 2016-09 includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. ASU 2016-09 is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period, with any adjustments reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We are in the process of determining our implementation approach for this standard and assessing the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 ), which is the final standard on the accounting for leases.  ASU 2016-02 was issued in three parts: (a)  Section A ,  Leases: Amendments to the  FASB Accounting Standards Codification   ,    Section B ,  Conforming Amendments Related to Leases: Amendments to the  FASB Accounting Standards Codification  ,   and  Section C ,  Background Information and Basis for Conclusions.   While both lessees and lessors are affected by the new guidance, the effects on lessees are much more significant.  The most significant change for lessees is the requirement under the new guidance to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases not considered short-term leases. By definition, a short-term lease is one in which: (a) the lease term is 12 months or less and (b) there is not an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise. For short-term leases, lessees may elect an accounting policy by class of underlying asset under which right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are not recognized and lease payments are generally recognized as expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis. This change will result in lessees recognizing right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases currently accounted for as operating leases under the legacy lease accounting guidance. For many entities, this could significantly affect the financial ratios they use for external reporting and other purposes, such as debt covenant

   compliance.  ASU 2016-02 is not effective until 2019 for calendar year public business entities and 2020 for all other calendar year entities.  We are in the process of determining our implementation approach for this standard and assessing the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-01,  Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  ( ASU 2016-01 ), which is the final standard on the recognition and measurement of financial instruments.  ASU 2016-01 applies to all entities that hold financial assets or owe financial liabilities and represents the finalization of just one component of the FASB s broader financial instruments project. The most far-reaching ramification of ASU 2016-01 is the elimination of the available-for-sale classification for equity securities and a new requirement to carry those equity securities with readily determinable fair values at fair value through net income. Other notable changes brought about by ASU 2016-01 involve: (a) applying a practicability exception from fair value accounting to equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value, (b) assessing the need for a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset related to an available-for-sale debt security, (c) applying the fair value option to liabilities and the treatment of changes in fair value attributable to instrument-specific credit risk and (d) adding disclosures and eliminating certain disclosures. ASU 2016-01 is not effective until 2018 for calendar year public business entities, certain provisions can be early adopted by public business entities in financial statements that have not been issued, and by other entities, in financial statements that have not been made available for issuance. We are in the process of determining our implementation approach for this standard and assessing the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements. 
     
  In September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-16,  Accounting for Measurement Period Adjustments in a Business Combination  ( ASU 2015-16 ), which requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. ASU 2015-16 will be effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, although early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  ( ASU 2015-11 ), which simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventory by replacing the lower of cost or market test with a lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV) test.  NRV is calculated as the estimated selling price less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.  ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years and for interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and prospective adoption is required.  We do not anticipate the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of guidance that was originally issued in May 2014 in Accounting Standards Update 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ( ASU 2014-09 ). The standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance. ASU 2014-09 is intended to provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues; improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets; and provide more useful information to users of financial statements through improved revenue disclosure requirements. The provisions of ASU 2014-09 will now be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We are in the process of determining our implementation approach for this standard and assessing the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.  
     
   Entry into Merger Agreement   
     
  On November 6, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ) with Insight Enterprises, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Parent ), and Reef Acquisition Co., a Minnesota corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ( Merger Sub ).  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into our company and our company will continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the  Merger ).  
     
  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of our common stock (other than shares held (1) by Parent or Merger Sub or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of our company or Parent, and (2) by shareholders who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for dissenters  rights or who have not otherwise lost dissenters  rights under Minnesota law with respect to such shares), will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive $11.25 cash, without interest.  
     
  Each party s obligation to consummate the Merger is subject to satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.  
     
  2.             Net Earnings per Share  
     
  We compute basic net earnings per share using the weighted average number of shares outstanding.  Diluted net earnings per share amounts include the effect of common stock equivalents, if any, for each period.  Diluted net earnings per share amounts assume the conversion, exercise or issuance of all potential common stock instruments unless their effect is anti-dilutive.  The following table computes basic and diluted net earnings per share:

   Repurchase of stock:   
     
  On September 14, 2015, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated purchases, or both, at an aggregate purchase price of up to $10 million. The timing and amount of any future share repurchases will be determined by our management based on market conditions and other factors. The repurchase programs are conducted pursuant to Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The share repurchase program is expected to be completed by December 31, 2016. Under this program, we may from time to time purchase our outstanding common stock in the open market at management s discretion, subject to share price, market conditions and other factors. The common stock repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we repurchased 600,000 shares of our common stock at a total purchase price of $4.2 million under this program. As of September 30, 2016, we were authorized to repurchase additional shares of our common stock at a total purchase price of up to $992,000 under the stock repurchase program.  
     
   Restricted Stock:   
     
  Total stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock was $1.2 million and $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Total stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock was $2.9 million and $4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock was $5.7 million at September 30, 2016, which we will amortize ratably through February 2021.  
     
  The following table summarizes our restricted stock activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:

   Stock Options:   
     
  Total stock-based compensation expense related to stock options was $161,000 and $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Total stock-based compensation expense related to stock options was $359,000 and $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to stock options was $1.2 million at September 30, 2016, which we will amortize through February 2020.  
     
  The following table represents stock option activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:  

On June 6, 2016 we granted 30,600 stock options to certain executives. Vesting of these options is based solely on the recipient s continued service as follows: 1/3 of the shares or units vest upon the first grant anniversary date, 1/3 of the shares or units vest upon the second grant anniversary date, and 1/3 of the shares or units vest upon the third grant anniversary date, provided that the individual remains employed by us through such dates. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options. The weighted-average fair value per option on the date of grant was $4.21. The fair value of stock options was estimated at the grant date using the following weighted average assumptions:  

On February 26, 2016 we granted 414,020 stock options to certain executives. Vesting of these options is based solely on the recipient s continued service as follows: 50% of the shares or units vest upon the second grant anniversary date, 25% of the shares or units vest upon the third grant anniversary date, and 25% of the shares or units vest upon the fourth grant anniversary date, provided that the individual remains employed by us through such dates. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options. The weighted-average fair value per option on the date of grant was $3.51. The fair value of stock options was estimated at the grant date using the following weighted average assumptions:

  Effective January 1, 2014 and pursuant to Deferred Stock Unit ( DSU ) Master Agreements, each member of our board of directors may elect to receive DSUs with a fair value equivalent to a percentage of each quarterly installment of the annual cash retainer for non-employee directors to which that member would otherwise be entitled for service as a Datalink director. In addition, each member of our board of directors may elect to receive a DSU award equal to a percentage of the award of shares of restricted stock to which that member would otherwise have been entitled as the equity component of the annual retainer. Annual DSUs are awarded during the second quarter but vest and become non-forfeitable on each of June 30, 2015, September 30, 2015, December 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016, provided the board member remains in service with Datalink. We will issue one share in payment and settlement of each vested DSU subject to the Master DSU Agreement following a termination of that board member s service with Datalink.

Unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested awards of shares to members of our board of directors was $210,000 at September 30, 2016, which we will recognize through March 2017.  
     
  4.             Income Taxes  
     
  We base the provision for income taxes upon estimated annual effective tax rates in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our annual effective tax rate was 28.2% and 41.8%, respectively, excluding discrete items.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our annual effective tax rate was 36.3% and 41.8%, respectively, excluding discrete items.  The decrease in our tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same periods in 2015 is primarily due to the estimated impact of federal and state Research   Development tax credits ( R D credits ) for 2016. Without the estimated 2016 R D credit, the annual effective tax rate would have been 44.6% and 42.7% for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. We expect our annual effective tax rate for 2016 to be approximately 36.3%.  
     
  As part of the process of preparing financial statements, we estimate federal and state income taxes. Management estimates the actual current tax and assesses temporary differences resulting from different treatments for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we include within our consolidated balance sheets. Management must then assess the likelihood that we will realize deferred tax assets, and has concluded that all deferred tax assets, with the exception of capital loss carryovers, are expected to be realized. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded an income tax expense of $18,000 and an income tax benefit of $222,000 with an effective tax rate of 3.2% and (5.9%), respectively, inclusive of discrete items. We recognized a discrete tax benefit of $141,000 and $1.6 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. The discrete adjustments include tax benefits for federal and state R D credits claimed, net of accrued liabilities and interest related to the IRS audit for 2012, 2013 and 2014.  
     
  Included in the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are potential benefits of $2.5 million and $209,000, respectively, that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. We anticipate the settlement of unrecognized tax benefits associated with the IRS audit in the next 12 months.  
     
  We classify income tax-related interest and penalties arising as a component of income tax expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had $210,000 and $0, respectively, of accrued interest or penalties which are included in the gross balance above.  
     
  We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 30, 2016, we were no longer subject to federal income tax examinations for taxable years before 2012. We are currently under IRS examination for the 2012-2014 tax years and have recorded a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits for the estimated tax and interest associated with this ongoing examination.  
     
  Our ability to utilize a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code due to changes in our equity ownership. As a result of the acquisition of Bear Data Solutions, Inc. ( Bear Data ) in October 2014, utilization of U.S. net operating losses and tax credits of Bear Data are subject to annual limitations under Internal Revenue Code Sections 382 and 383, respectively.  
     
  5.             Goodwill and Finite-Lived Intangible Assets  
     
  We assess the carrying amount of our goodwill for potential impairment annually or more frequently if events or a change in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred.  We perform an impairment test for finite-lived assets, such as intangible assets, and other long-lived assets, such as fixed assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.  Circumstances that could represent triggering events and therefore require an interim impairment test of goodwill or evaluation of our finite-lived intangible assets or other long-lived assets include the following:  loss of key personnel, unanticipated competition, higher or earlier than expected customer attrition, deterioration of operating performance, significant adverse industry, economic or regulatory changes or a significant decline in market capitalization.

Table of Contents   
     
  We have only one operating and reporting unit that earns revenues, incurs expenses and makes available discrete financial information for review by our chief operations decision maker.  Accordingly, we complete our goodwill impairment testing on this single reporting unit.  
     
  In conducting the annual impairment test of our goodwill, qualitative factors are first examined to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.  If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a two-step impairment test is applied.  The first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of our market capitalization with the carrying value of our net assets. If our total market capitalization is at or below the carrying value of our net assets, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss we record, if any.  We consider goodwill impairment test estimates critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts.  
     
  Goodwill was $47.1 million as of each of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  We conducted our annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2015, our last measurement date.  Based on this analysis, we determined that there was no impairment to goodwill.  We will continue to monitor conditions and changes that could indicate impairment of our recorded goodwill.  
     
  At each of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we determined that no triggering events had occurred and our finite-lived assets and long-lived assets were not impaired.  
     
  Identified intangible assets are summarized as follows (in thousands):  

Amortization expense for identified intangible assets is recorded in operating expenses within our consolidated statements of operation and is summarized below:  

Based on the identified intangible assets recorded at September 30, 2016, scheduled future amortization expense is as follows:  

6.             Short-Term Investments  
     
  Our short-term investments consist of commercial paper and corporate bonds. We categorize these investments as trading securities and record them at fair value. We classify investments with maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase as cash equivalents;  
     
 11   

Table of Contents   
     
  investments with maturities of greater than 90 days from the date of purchase but less than one year generally as short-term investments; and investments with maturities of greater than one year from the date of purchase generally as long-term investments. The following table summarizes our short-term investments:  

Our $30.0 million of short-term investments at September 30, 2016 is comprised of commercial paper with maturities within one year and interest rates ranging from 0.5% to 1.1%.  
     
  7.             Fair Value Measurements  
     
  Fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  In determining fair value for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.  We apply fair value measurements for both financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities.  We have no nonfinancial assets or liabilities that require measurement at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016.  
     
  The fair value of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, floor plan line of credit and accrued expenses, approximate cost because of their short maturities.  
     
  We use the three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair values.  The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).  The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:  
     
                        Level 1   Unadjusted quoted prices available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. 
                        Level 2   Significant other observable inputs available at the measurement date, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, either directly or indirectly. 
                        Level 3   Significant unobservable inputs that we cannot corroborate by observable market data and thus reflect the use of significant management judgment.  We generally determine these values using pricing models based on assumptions our management believes other market participants would make. 
     
  The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available.  In instances in which the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, we determine the fair value measurement based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.  Our assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability.  The following table sets forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy, the accounting of our financial assets and/or liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 according to the valuation techniques we used to determine their fair value(s).

  8.                                         Sales-Type Leases Receivables and Sales-Leaseback Arrangements 
     
  We occasionally enter into sales-type lease agreements with our customers resulting from the sale of certain products. Our lease receivables are recorded at cost within the accounts receivable and long-term lease receivables balances on our consolidated balance sheets and are due in installments over the lives of the leases. Cash received and applied against the receivable balance is recorded within changes in operating assets and liabilities in the net cash provided by operating activities section of the consolidated statements of cash flows.  Finance income is derived over the term of the sales-type lease arrangement as the unearned income on financed sales-type leases is earned. Unearned income is amortized over the life of the lease using the interest method.  The present value of net investment in sales-type lease receivables of $9.7 million and $10.4 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, is reflected net of unearned interest income of $326,000 and $492,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, scheduled maturities of minimum lease payments receivable were as follows for the fiscal years ending December 31:  

Lease receivables are individually evaluated for impairment. In the event we determine that a lease receivable may not be paid, we include in our allowance an amount for the outstanding balance related to the lease receivable. At September 30, 2016, there were no material amounts past due related to lease receivables.  
     
  Our lease receivables typically generate monthly cash inflows with average lease durations of 24 to 36 months. To better match cash outflows related to these receivables, we occasionally finance the equipment associated with our leases receivable through sales-leaseback arrangements over a period commensurate with the receivable. Gains associated with these sales are deferred in accordance with the accounting for sales-leaseback transactions and are amortized over the lives of the related lease agreements.  As of September 30, 2016, our contractual cash obligations for future minimum lease payments were as follows for the fiscal years ending December 31:  

Of the $8.1 million of contractual cash obligations for future minimum lease payments at September 30, 2016, $322,000 represented interest.  
     
  9.                                         Line of Credit 
     
  On July 17, 2013, we entered into a Credit Agreement ( Credit Agreement ) with Castle Pines Capital LLC ( CPC ), an affiliate of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ( Wells Fargo ). The Credit Agreement provided for a channel finance facility ( Floor Plan Line of Credit ) and a revolving facility ( Revolving Facility  and, together with the Floor Plan Line of Credit,  Combined Facility ) in a maximum combined aggregate amount of $40 million. On May 21, 2015, we entered into the Second Amendment to Credit Agreement (the  Amended Agreement ), which provides an increase to the Combined Facility for a maximum combined aggregate borrowing amount of $75 million. Under the Amended Agreement, borrowing under the Revolving Facility cannot exceed the lesser  
     
 13   

Table of Contents   
     
  of (i) $75 million minus the amount outstanding under the Floor Plan Line of Credit or (ii) a borrowing base consisting of 85% of certain eligible accounts and 100% of channel financed inventory, subject to CPC s ability to impose reserves in the future. The Floor Plan Line of Credit will finance certain purchases of inventory by us from vendors approved by CPC, and the Revolving Facility may be used for working capital purposes and permitted acquisitions.  
     
  The amounts outstanding under the Revolving Facility bear interest at a per annum rate of 2.0% above Wells Fargo s one-month LIBOR rate (approximately 0.53% at September 30, 2016). Advances under the Floor Plan Line of Credit will not bear interest so long as they are paid by the applicable payment due date and advances that remain outstanding after the applicable payment due date will bear interest at a per annum rate of LIBOR plus 4%. Under the Credit Agreement, we were obligated to pay quarterly to CPC an unused commitment fee equal to 0.50% per annum on the average daily unused amount of the Combined Facility, with usage including the sum of any advances under either the Floor Plan Line of Credit or the Revolving Facility. The Amended Agreement eliminates the unused commitment fee. The Combined Facility and certain bank product obligations owed to Wells Fargo or its affiliates are secured by substantially all of our personal property. The Amended Agreement terminates on January 9, 2018 and we will be obligated to pay certain prepayment fees if the Credit Agreement is terminated prior to that date.  
     
  The Amended Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and events of default, including but not limited to, covenants restricting our ability to (i) grant liens on our assets, (ii) make certain fundamental changes, including merging or consolidating with another entity or making any material change in the nature of our business, (iii) make certain dividends or distributions, (iv) make certain loans or investments, (v) guarantee or become liable in any way on certain liabilities or obligations of any other person or entity, or (vi) incur certain indebtedness.  
     
  The Amended Agreement contains certain covenants regarding our financial performance, including (i) a minimum tangible net worth of at least $30 million and (ii) a minimum quarterly free cash flow requirement, which requires us to have free cash flow of at least $5 million at the end of each fiscal quarter for the trailing twelve-month period then ended. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the aforementioned financial covenants as set forth in the Amended Agreement. However, subsequent to September 30, 2016, we notified CPC that we did not have free cash flow of at least $5 million at the end of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, and we requested a waiver of the relevant provision of the Amended Agreement. On October 31, 2016, we entered into the Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement, which modifies the minimum quarterly free cash flow requirement such that, at any time and from time to time that our cash as reported on our fiscal quarterly consolidated balance sheet is less than $25,000,000, we shall have free cash flow of at least $1.00 at the end of such fiscal quarter for the trailing twelve-month period then ended, and shall continue to have free cash flow of at least $1.00 at the end of our trailing twelve-month period ending each fiscal quarter thereafter, until such time as our cash as reported on our fiscal quarterly consolidated balance sheet is greater than $25,000,000, commencing December 31, 2015 and continuing at the end of each fiscal quarter thereafter.  
     
  Of the $75 million maximum borrowing amount available at September 30, 2016 under the Combined Facility, advances of $31.7 million and $24.3 million were outstanding on the Floor Plan Line of Credit at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, related to the purchase of inventory from certain vendors.

   OVERVIEW   
     
  We provide information technology (IT) services and solutions that help organizations transform technology, operations and service delivery to meet business challenges. Focused on midsize and large companies, we provide a full life cycle of services including consulting, strategy, design, deployment, management, and support. We leverage technology from the industry s leading original equipment manufacturers as part of our IT solutions portfolio. Our portfolio of services and solutions spans four practices: cloud, data center transformation, next-generation technology and security. We offer a full suite of practice-specific consulting, analysis, design, implementation, management, and support services.  
     
  Our solutions can include hardware products, such as servers, disk arrays, tape systems, networking and interconnection components and software products.  Our data center strategy is supported through multiple trends in the market and involves supporting the market and our clients with a single vendor to provide their data center infrastructure needs.  As of September 30, 2016, we had 34 locations, including both leased facilities and home offices, throughout the United States.  We historically have derived our greatest percentage of net sales from clients located in the central part of the United States.  
     
  We sell support service contracts to most of our clients.  In about half of the support service contracts that we sell, our clients purchase support services through us, resulting in clients receiving the benefit of integrated system-wide support.  We have a qualified, independent support desk that takes calls from clients, diagnoses the issues they are facing and either solves the problem or coordinates with our and/or vendor technical staff to meet the client s needs.  Our support service agreements with our clients include an underlying agreement with the product manufacturer.  The manufacturer provides on-site support assistance if necessary. The other half of the support service contracts that we sell to our clients are directly between the client and the product manufacturer. For all support service contracts we sell, we defer revenues and direct costs resulting from these contracts, and amortize these revenues and expenses into operations, over the term of the contracts, generally one to three years.  
     
  The data center infrastructure solutions and services market is rapidly evolving and highly competitive.  Our competition includes other independent storage, server and networking system integrators, high-end value-added resellers, distributors, consultants and the internal sales force of our suppliers.  Our ability to hire and retain qualified outside sales representatives and engineers with enterprise-class information storage, server and networking experience is critical to effectively compete in the marketplace and achieve our growth strategies.  
     
  In the past, we have experienced fluctuations in the timing of orders from our clients, and we expect to continue to experience these fluctuations in the future.  These fluctuations have resulted from, among other things, the time required to design, test and evaluate our data center infrastructure solutions before clients deploy them, the size of client orders, the complexity of our clients  network environments, necessary system configuration to deploy our solutions and new product introductions by suppliers.  Current economic conditions and competition also affect our clients  decisions and timing to place orders with us and the size of those orders.  As a result, our net sales may fluctuate from quarter to quarter.  
     
   Pending Merger  . On November 6, 2016, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Insight Enterprises, Inc. and Reef Acquisition Co.  Please see Note 1 to our financial statements for further information.  The consummation of the Merger remains subject to certain customary closing conditions, including the approval of our shareholders and completion of regulatory review. Important information regarding certain risks associated with the Merger Agreement and Merger are discussed under the heading  Risk Factors  in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q. 
     
   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   
     
  The following table shows, for the periods indicated, certain selected financial data expressed as a percentage of net sales.

Table of Contents   
     
  The following table shows, for the periods indicated, revenue and gross profit information for our product and service sales.  

The following table shows, for the periods indicated, revenues by revenue mix component expressed as a percentage of net sales.  

Our product sales continue to reflect a diversification in the mix of our offerings. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, product sales represented 58.7% and 58.8%, respectively, of our total sales compared to 62.6% and 61.0%, respectively, for the comparable periods in 2015. The decrease in our product sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015 reflect a continued decline in our networking and server revenues as clients continue to evaluate new technologies such as solid state memory and hyper-converged offerings. We cannot assure that changes in customer spending or economic conditions will positively impact our future product sales.  
     
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, service sales represented 41.3% and 41.2%, respectively, of our total sales compared to 37.4% and 39.0%, respectively, for the comparable periods in 2015. The dollar increase in our service sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 reflects the impact of accelerating momentum for our virtualized data center solutions and services offerings including unified monitoring, managed infrastructure services for the entire multi-vendor virtualized data center, and managed services offerings for backup, monitoring, archiving, cloud backup and cloud enablement services which help companies analyze the impact of cloud deployments on their business.  In addition, we are continuing to expand into markets like security and software-defined data centers, which we expect will increase our relevance to customers and maximize customer retention by providing a single trusted source for all of their data center needs. We continue to successfully sell our installation and configuration services and customer support contracts. Without continued sustainable growth in our product sales going forward, we would expect our customer support contract sales to suffer and we cannot assure that our future customer support contract sales will not decline.  
     
  We had no single customer account for 10% or greater of our revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015. However, our top five customers collectively accounted for 13.1% and 18.8% of our revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 12.9% and 12.7% of our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
   Gross Profit  .  Our total gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 17.9% for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 17.6% for the comparable quarter in 2015.  Our total gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 18.8% for the

Table of Contents   
     
  nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 19.2% for the comparable period in 2015.  Product gross profit as a percentage of product sales increased to 17.6% in the third quarter of 2016 from 15.9% for the comparable quarter in 2015.  Product gross profit as a percentage of product sales increased to 18.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 18.0% for the same period in 2015.  Service gross profit as a percentage of service sales decreased to 18.4% for the third quarter of 2016 from 20.5% for the comparable quarter in 2015.  Service gross profit as a percentage of service sales decreased to 19.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 20.9% for the same period in 2015.  
     
  Our product gross profit as a percentage of product sales is impacted by the mix and type of projects we complete for our customers.  Product gross profit as a percentage of product sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased 1.7% and 0.7%, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2015. The increase for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to an increase in higher-margin storage and software product revenue and a decrease in lower-margin networking product revenue as a percentage of sales as compared to the comparable periods in 2015. The increase in product gross profit was also due to increased vendor incentives for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the comparable periods in 2015. Our product gross profit is impacted by various vendor incentive programs that provide economic incentives for achieving various sales performance targets and early payment of invoices. Vendor incentives were $2.2 million and $1.8 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  Vendor incentives were $7.5 million and $6.7 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  As a percentage of product cost of goods sold, vendor incentives were 2.5% and 1.7%, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and 2.9% and 2.4%, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These vendor programs constantly change and we negotiate them separately with each vendor.  While we expect the incentive and early pay programs to continue, the vendors could modify or discontinue them, particularly in light of current economic conditions, which would unfavorably impact our product gross profit margins.  We expect that our product gross margins for the remainder of 2016 will be between 15% and 18%.  
     
  Service gross profit as a percentage of service sales decreased 2.1% and 1.9% for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2015.  This decrease was primarily driven by a combination of a reduction in consulting services margin during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and a continued decline in gross margins on support contracts for which we are able to sell one call support, partially offset by a shift in our customer support contract mix resulting in a higher percentage of one call support contracts carrying higher gross margins than those with pass-through support.  We expect that our service gross margins for the remainder of 2016 will be between 18% and 22%.  
     
   Sales and Marketing  .  Sales and marketing expenses include wages and commission paid to sales and marketing personnel, travel costs and advertising, promotion and hiring expenses.  We expense advertising costs as incurred. Sales and marketing expenses totaled $15.9 million, or 8.6% of net sales, for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to $16.4 million, or 8.3% of net sales, for the third quarter in 2015.  Sales and marketing expenses totaled $49.5 million, or 9.0% of net sales, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $52.1 million, or 9.4% of net sales, for the same period in 2015. 
     
  Sales and marketing expenses decreased $522,000 for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 and decreased $2.6 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same periods in 2015.  The decreases in sales and marketing expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 were primarily due to decreases in salaries, wages, and benefits of $477,000 and $1.7 million, respectively, due to decreased headcount. We expect that our sales and marketing expenses will be within the range of 8% to 10% of net sales for the remainder of 2016.  
     
   General and Administrative  .  General and administrative expenses include wages for administrative personnel, professional fees, depreciation, communication expenses and rent and related facility expenses. General and administrative expenses were $6.6 million, or 3.6% of net sales, for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to $6.3 million, or 3.2% of net sales, for the third quarter in 2015.  General and administrative expenses were $20.7 million, or 3.8% of net sales, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $19.7 million, or 3.5% of net sales, for the same period in 2015. 
     
  General and administrative expenses increased $346,000 and $988,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2015. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to increases in bonus expense of $261,000 and $981,000, respectively and increases in stock compensation expense of $225,000 and $368,000, respectively, partially offset by decreases in facilities expenses of $212,000 and $615,000, respectively.  
     
   Engineering  .  Engineering expenses include employee wages, bonuses and travel, hiring and training expenses for our field and customer support engineers and technicians.  Engineering expenses were $7.9 million, or 4.3% of net sales, for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to $7.6 million, or 3.8% of net sales, for the third quarter in 2015.  Engineering expenses were $24.0 million, or 4.4% of net sales, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $24.5 million, or 4.4% of net sales, for the same period in 2015. 
     
  Engineering expenses increased $321,000 and decreased $504,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2015.  The increase in engineering expenses for the three months ended September

Table of Contents   
     
  30, 2016 is primarily due to an increase in outside services, data center services, and contracted engineering of $251,000.  The decrease in engineering expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily due to a decrease in salaries and benefits of $939,000, commensurate with the decrease in engineering headcount during the 2016 period, partially offset by an increase in bonuses of $643,000.  
     
   Integration and Transaction Costs  .  We had $739,000 and $923,000 of integration and transaction costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. We had $419,000 and $939,000 of integration and transaction costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. On November 6, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ) with Insight Enterprises, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Parent ), and Reef Acquisition Co., a Minnesota corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ( Merger Sub ).  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into our company and our company will continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the  Merger ). Integration and transaction expenses in 2016 were due primarily to this Merger Agreement. Integration and transaction expenses in 2015 for the Bear Data acquisition included audit, legal, and other outside consulting fees as well as salaries, benefits and retention bonuses of exiting employees, some of whom assisted with the integration of Bear Data. 
     
   Amortization of Intangibles  .  We had $1.3 million and $1.7 million of intangible asset amortization expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  We had $4.1 million and $5.7 million of intangible asset amortization expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Amortization expense in 2016 and 2015 was related to the acquisitions of Bear Data in 2014, StraTech in October 2012 and Midwave in October 2011. The finite-lived intangible assets we acquired in the Bear Data acquisition consisted of covenants not to compete, trademarks, customer relationships and order backlog having estimated lives of three years, three years, six years and three months, respectively. We are amortizing the customer relationships acquired in the Bear Data acquisition using an accelerated amortization method, to match the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be consumed.  We are amortizing the covenants not to compete, trademarks, and order backlog using the straight-line method. The finite-lived intangible asset we acquired in our acquisition of StraTech consisted of customer relationships having an estimated life of five years that we are amortizing using an accelerated amortization method, to match the pattern in which the economic benefits of that asset are expected to be consumed. The finite-lived intangibles we acquired in our acquisition of Midwave consisted of covenants not to compete, order backlog and customer relationships having estimated lives of three years, three months and five years, respectively. We are amortizing the finite-lived intangible assets we acquired in our Midwave acquisition primarily using the straight line method. The decrease in amortization of intangibles expenses in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to our use of an accelerated amortization method in amortizing the customer relationships acquired in the Bear Data acquisition. 
     
   Earnings from Operations  .  We had earnings from operations of $504,000 compared to earnings from operations of $2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  We had earnings from operations of $3.7 million compared to earnings from operations of $3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in earnings from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the comparable period in 2015 was primarily the result of a reduction in product revenue and margin during the three months ended September 30, 2016 combined with increased engineering and general and administrative expenses, partially offset by reductions in sales and marketing expenses. The increase in earnings from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the comparable period in 2015 was primarily the result of reductions in sales and marketing and engineering expenses due to decreases in headcount, partially offset by a reduction in product revenue and margin and a reduction in the gross margin percentage on professional services as driven by a decline in consulting services revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and a continued decline in gross margins on support contracts for which we are able to sell one call support. 
     
   Income Taxes  .  We had income tax expense of $18,000 and $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  We had an income tax benefit of $222,000 and income tax expense of $1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Our estimated effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 28.2% and 36.3%, respectively. Our estimated effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was 48.0% and 46.5%, respectively. The decrease in our tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015 is primarily due to the impact of Research   Development tax credits ( R D credits ). We have determined that certain activities we perform qualify for R D credits as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 41. We recognized discrete tax benefits of $141,000 and $1.6 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. For the balance of 2016, we expect to report an income tax provision using an effective tax rate of approximately 36.3%, without discrete items.

  Net cash provided by operating activities was $15.4 million and $6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was due primarily to a $6.7 million decrease in inventory, non-cash add backs including amortization of intangibles of $4.1 million, and net earnings of $4.0 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was due primarily to a $19.2 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $2.4 million decrease in deferred customer support contract costs/revenues and customer deposits, net, non-cash add backs including amortization of intangibles of $5.7 million and depreciation of $2.4 million and net earnings of $2.0 million, partially offset by a $21.7 million decrease in accounts and leases payable, a $7.4 million increase in inventory, and a $4.9 decrease in accrued expenses.  
     
  Net cash used in investing activities was $11.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $6.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The primary use of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was for the net purchase of $9.3 million of trading securities and for the purchase of $2.7 million of property and equipment. The primary use of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was for the net purchase of $3.6 million of trading securities and for the purchase of $3.0 million of property and equipment. For the remainder of 2016, we are planning for capital expenditures of up to $750,000, primarily related to enhancements to our management information systems and upgraded computer equipment.  
     
  Net cash provided by financing activities was $2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, due mainly to $7.4 million of proceeds from our channel finance facility, partially offset by repurchases of $4.2 million of our common stock. Net cash used in financing activities was $3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and was primarily attributable to proceeds of $2.2 million under our channel finance facility.  
     
  On July 17, 2013, we entered into a Credit Agreement ( Credit Agreement ) with Castle Pines Capital LLC ( CPC ), an affiliate of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ( Wells Fargo ). The Credit Agreement provided for a channel finance facility ( Floor Plan Line of Credit ) and a revolving facility ( Revolving Facility  and, together with the Floor Plan Line of Credit,  Combined Facility ) in a maximum combined aggregate amount of $40 million. On May 21, 2015, we entered into the Second Amendment to Credit Agreement (the  Amended Agreement ), which provides an increase to the Combined Facility for a maximum combined aggregate borrowing amount of $75 million. Under the Amended Agreement, borrowing under the Revolving Facility cannot exceed the lesser of (i) $75 million minus the amount outstanding under the Floor Plan Line of Credit or (ii) a borrowing base consisting of 85% of certain eligible accounts and 100% of channel financed inventory, subject to CPC s ability to impose reserves in the future. The Floor Plan Line of Credit will finance certain purchases of inventory by us from vendors approved by CPC, and the Revolving Facility may be used for working capital purposes and permitted acquisitions.  
     
  The amounts outstanding under the Revolving Facility bear interest at a per annum rate of 2.0% above Wells Fargo s one-month LIBOR rate (approximately 0.53% at September 30, 2016). Advances under the Floor Plan Line of Credit will not bear interest so long as they are paid by the applicable payment due date and advances that remain outstanding after the applicable payment due date will bear interest at a per annum rate of LIBOR plus 4%. Under the Credit Agreement, we were obligated to pay quarterly to CPC an unused commitment fee equal to 0.50% per annum on the average daily unused amount of the Combined Facility, with usage including the sum of any advances under either the Floor Plan Line of Credit or the Revolving Facility. The Amended Agreement eliminates the unused commitment fee. The Combined Facility and certain bank product obligations owed to Wells Fargo or its affiliates are secured by substantially all of our personal property. The Amended Agreement terminates on January 9, 2018 and we will be obligated to pay certain prepayment fees if the Credit Agreement is terminated prior to that date.  
     
  The Amended Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and events of default, including but not limited to, covenants restricting our ability to (i) grant liens on our assets, (ii) make certain fundamental changes, including merging or consolidating with another entity or making any material change in the nature of our business, (iii) make certain dividends or distributions, (iv) make certain loans or investments, (v) guarantee or become liable in any way on certain liabilities or obligations of any other person or entity, or (vi) incur certain indebtedness.  
     
  The Amended Agreement contains certain covenants regarding our financial performance, including (i) a minimum tangible net worth of at least $30 million and (ii) a minimum quarterly free cash flow requirement, which requires us to have free cash flow of at least $5 million at the end of each fiscal quarter for the trailing twelve-month period then ended. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the aforementioned financial covenants as set forth in the Amended Agreement. However, subsequent to September 30, 2016, we notified CPC that we did not have free cash flow of at least $5 million at the end of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, and we requested a waiver of the relevant provision of the Amended Agreement. On October 31, 2016, we entered into the Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement, which modifies the minimum quarterly free cash flow requirement such that, at any time and from time to time that our cash as reported on our fiscal quarterly consolidated balance sheet is less than $25,000,000, we shall have free cash flow of at least $1.00 at the end of such fiscal quarter for the trailing twelve-month period then ended, and shall continue to have free cash flow of at least $1.00 at the end of our trailing twelve-month period ending each fiscal quarter thereafter, until such

  time as our cash as reported on our fiscal quarterly consolidated balance sheet is greater than $25,000,000, commencing December 31, 2015 and continuing at the end of each fiscal quarter thereafter.  
     
  Of the $75 million maximum borrowing amount available at September 30, 2016 under the Combined Facility, advances of $31.7 million and $24.3 million were outstanding on the Floor Plan Line of Credit at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, related to the purchase of inventory from certain vendors.  
     
  Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned and will depend on many factors, including our strategy to continue to grow our business by select acquisitions. Historically, we have experienced an increase in our expenditures consistent with the growth of our operations and we anticipate our expenditures will continue to increase as we grow our business by acquisitions or organically. We believe that funds generated from our operations and available from our borrowing facilities will be sufficient to fund current business operations and anticipated growth.  
     
   OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS   
     
  We do not have any special purpose entities or off-balance sheet arrangements.  
     
   CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS

   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES   
     
  We have identified our critical accounting policies in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  under the heading  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.   There have been no significant changes in critical accounting policies for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to those disclosed in the our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
     
  As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).  Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in  Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016.  
     
   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   
     
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

   Item 1.      Legal Proceedings    
     
  We are involved in certain legal actions, all of which have arisen in the ordinary course of business.  Management believes that the ultimate resolution of such matters is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operation and/or financial condition.  
     
   Item 1A.  Risk Factors     
     
   Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes a discussion of our risk factors. The information presented below updates, and should be read in conjunction with, the risk factors and information disclosed in our Form 10-K. Except as presented below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors described in our Form 10-K.  
     
   The announcement and pendency of our agreement to be acquired by Insight Enterprises, Inc. could have an adverse effect on our business.   
     
  On November 6, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ) with Insight Enterprises, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Parent ), and Reef Acquisition Co., a Minnesota corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ( Merger Sub ).  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into our company and our company will continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the  Merger ).  
     
  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of our common stock (other than shares held (1) by Parent or Merger Sub or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of our company or Parent, and (2) by shareholders who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for dissenters  rights or who have not otherwise lost dissenters  rights under Minnesota law with respect to such shares), will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive $11.25 cash, without interest.  
     
  Each party s obligation to consummate the Merger is subject to satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.  
     
  Uncertainty about the effect of the Merger on our employees and customers may have an adverse effect on our business and operations that may be material to our company. Our employees may experience uncertainty about their roles following the Merger. There can be no assurance we will be able to attract and retain key talent, including senior leaders, to the same extent that we have previously been able to attract and retain employees. Any loss or distraction of such employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. In addition, we have diverted, and will continue to divert, significant management resources towards the completion of the Merger, which could materially adversely affect our business and operations.  
     
  Our customers may experience uncertainty associated with the Merger, including with respect to treatment of customer data, concerns about possible changes to our products, services or policies, and current or future business relationships with us. Uncertainty may cause customers to refrain from purchasing our products or services, and vendors may seek to change existing business relationships, which could result in an adverse effect on our business, operations and financial position in a way that may be material to our company.  
     
  Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business, including the ability in certain cases to enter into contracts, acquire or dispose of assets, incur indebtedness or incur capital expenditures, until the Merger becomes effective or the Merger Agreement is terminated. These restrictions may prevent us from taking actions with respect to our business that we may consider advantageous and result in our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and industry developments, and may otherwise harm our business and operations.  
     
   The failure to complete the Merger could adversely affect our business.   
     
  Completion of the Merger is subject to conditions beyond our control that may prevent, delay or otherwise adversely affect its completion in a material way, including the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under antitrust and competition laws and similar competition approvals or consents that must be obtained from regulatory entities. If the Merger or a similar transaction is not completed, the share price of our common stock may drop to the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects an assumption that a transaction will be completed. In addition, under circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, we may be required to pay a termination fee of $7.5 million in the event the Merger is not consummated. Further, a failure to complete the Merger may result in negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment community. Any disruption to our business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the Merger and from intensifying competition from our competitors, including any adverse changes in our relationships with our customers and vendors, could continue or accelerate in the event of a failure to complete the Merger. There can be no assurance that our business, these relationships or our financial condition will not be adversely affected, as compared to the condition prior to the announcement of the Merger, if the Merger is not consummated.

   Item 2.      Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds    
     
  On September 14, 2015, our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated purchases, or both, at an aggregate purchase price of up to $10 million. The timing and amount of any future share repurchases will be determined by our management based on market conditions and other factors.  The share repurchase program is expected to be completed by December 31, 2016. Under this program, we may from time to time purchase our outstanding common stock in the open market at management s discretion, subject to share price, market conditions and other factors. The common stock repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we repurchased 600,000 shares of our common stock at a total purchase price of $4.2 million under this program. The common stock repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares. Common stock repurchase activity through September 30, 2016 was as follows:

   FOURTH AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT AND WAIVER
