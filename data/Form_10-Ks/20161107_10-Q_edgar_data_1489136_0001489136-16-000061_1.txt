Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
  Certain matters contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). We make these forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
  All statements, other than statements of historical fact, included in this Form 10-Q regarding the prospects of our industry, our anticipated financial performance, management s plans and objectives for future operations, planned capital expenditures, business prospects, outcome of regulatory proceedings, market conditions and other matters, may constitute forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as "may," "will," "expect," "intend," "estimate," "foresee," "project," "anticipate," "believe," "plans," "forecasts," "continue" or "could" or the negative of these terms or variations of them or similar terms. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot assure you that these expectations will prove to be correct. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain known and unknown risks, and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Item 1A of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, entitled "Risk Factors," risk factors discussed in other reports and documents that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and the following: 
             
    The failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction, consummated on September 30, 2016, pursuant to which we acquired all of the outstanding common units of our subsidiary, Rose Rock Midstream, L.P. ( Rose Rock ), not already owned by us; 
                
    Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable us to pay our debt obligations and our current and expected dividends or to fund our other liquidity needs; 
                
    Any sustained reduction in demand for, or supply of, the petroleum products we gather, transport, process, market and store; 
                
    The effect of our debt level on our future financial and operating flexibility, including our ability to obtain additional capital on terms that are favorable to us; 
                
    Our ability to access the debt and equity markets, which will depend on general market conditions and the credit ratings for our debt obligations and equity;  
                
    The loss of, or a material nonpayment or nonperformance by, any of our key customers; 
                
    The amount of cash distributions, capital requirements and performance of our investments and joint ventures; 
                
    The amount of collateral required to be posted from time to time in our commodity purchase, sale or derivative transactions; 
                
    The impact of operational and developmental hazards and unforeseen interruptions; 
                
    Our ability to obtain new sources of supply of petroleum products; 
                
    Competition from other midstream energy companies; 
                
    Our ability to comply with the covenants contained in our credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes, including requirements under our credit agreement to maintain certain financial ratios; 
                
    Our ability to renew or replace expiring storage, transportation and related contracts;  
                
    The overall forward markets for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids; 
                
    The possibility that the construction or acquisition of new assets may not result in the corresponding anticipated revenue increases; 
                
    Changes in currency exchange rates;  
                
    Weather and other natural phenomena, including climate conditions; 
                
    A cyber attack involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business associates; 
                
    The risks and uncertainties of doing business outside of the U.S., including political and economic instability and changes in local governmental laws, regulations and policies; 
                
    Costs of, or changes in, laws and regulations and our failure to comply with new or existing laws or regulations, particularly with regard to taxes, safety and protection of the environment; 
     
   Page   3 

     Table of Contents  

The possibility that our hedging activities may result in losses or may have a negative impact on our financial results; and 
                
    General economic, market and business conditions. 
     New factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all such factors, or the extent to which any such factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ from those contained in any forward-looking statement. 
  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q, which reflect management s opinions only as of the date hereof. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to any forward-looking statements.

SEMGROUP CORPORATION 
  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

SemGroup Corporation is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The terms "we," "our," "us," "SemGroup," "the Company" and similar language used in these notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements refer to SemGroup Corporation and its subsidiaries. 
  Basis of presentation 
  The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet at   December 31, 2015  , which is derived from audited financial statements, and the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). These financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company and the results of its operations and its cash flows.  
  Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our controlled subsidiaries. All significant transactions between our consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated. 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Although management believes these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ materially from these estimates. The results of operations for the   three months and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending   December 31, 2016  . 
  Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and notes normally included with financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Certain reclassifications have been made to conform previously reported balances to the current presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , filed with the SEC. 
  Our significant accounting policies are consistent with those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Recent accounting pronouncements 
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force)", to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows.  The update addresses eight different transaction types and clarifies how to classify each in the statement of cash flows, where previously there was unclear or no specific guidance.  For public entities, this ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years and early adoption is permitted in the year prior to the effective date. We will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2018.  The impact is not expected to be material. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments", which introduces new guidance for estimating credit losses on certain types of financial instruments based on expected losses and the timing of the recognition of such losses.  For public entities, this ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those years and early adoption is permitted in the year prior to the effective date. We will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2020.  The impact is not expected to be material. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting'', which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. For public entities, this ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years and early adoption is permitted. We will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2017.  The impact is not expected to be material.

    OVERVIEW,   Continued 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)", which amends the existing lease guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by operating and finance leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. This ASU also provides clarifications surrounding the presentation of the effects of leases in the income statement and statement of cash flows. For public entities, this ASU will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years. The new guidance will be applied using a modified retrospective approach and early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements.  We will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2019.  
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes", which requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent in the statement of financial position.  For public entities, this ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years. The new guidance may be applied prospectively or retrospectively and early adoption is permitted. We have not determined which method we will apply when we adopt the standard. We will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2017.  The impact is not expected to be material. 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, "Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory", which requires that inventory within the scope of the guidance be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value rather than the lower of cost or market.  The standard will be effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The new guidance shall be applied prospectively and early adoption is permitted.  We will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2017.  The impact is not expected to be material. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs , which is designed to simplify presentation of debt issuance costs. The standard requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15,  Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements - Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting,  which amended the SEC paragraphs of ASC Subtopic 835-30 to include the language from the SEC Staff Announcement indicating that the SEC would not object to presenting deferred debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit agreements as assets and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the agreement. The standards are effective for U.S. public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The new guidance has been applied on a retrospective basis for all periods presented.  We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2016.  The impact was not material. For presentation purposes,   $16.8 million   of debt issuance costs which had previously been reported as other noncurrent assets were reclassified as a reduction of long-term debt on the December 31, 2015 balance sheet.  Capitalized loan fees related to our revolving credit facility continues to be presented as other noncurrent assets. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,  Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,  which adds requirements that limited partnerships must meet to qualify as voting interest entities and modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships are variable interest entities or voting interest entities. It also eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership. This guidance is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2016. The impact was not material.   
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP.  The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP.  The standard permits using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures).  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year.  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08 which amended the principal-versus-agent implementation guidance set forth in ASU 2014-09. Among other

    OVERVIEW,   Continued 

things, ASU 2016-08 clarifies that an entity should evaluate whether it is the principal or the agent for each specified good or service promised in a contract with a customer.  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10 which amended certain aspects of the guidance related to identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation within ASU 2014-09. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12 which narrows the scope around certain aspects of the criterion used in determining when to recognize revenue. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined the method by which we will adopt the standard.  We will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2018.

    ROSE ROCK MIDSTREAM, L.P. 
     On September 30, 2016, we completed the acquisition of the outstanding common limited partner interest of Rose Rock Midstream, L.P. ("Rose Rock") which we did not already own (the "Merger").  We issued   13.1 million   common shares as consideration and recorded a reduction to equity for   $5.3 million   of fees associated with the issuance.  We accounted for the Merger in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification 810,   Consolidation   Overall   Changes in a Parent s Ownership Interest in a Subsidiary  .  As SemGroup controlled Rose Rock both before and after the Merger, the changes in SemGroup s ownership interest in Rose Rock were accounted for as an equity transaction and no gain or loss was recognized in SemGroup s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) as a result of the Merger.  Subsequent to the Merger, Rose Rock was a wholly owned subsidiary of SemGroup.  
  Substantially all of Rose Rock's assets were pledged as collateral under its senior secured revolving credit facility agreement which was terminated following the Merger.  Substantially all of Rose Rock's assets are now pledged as collateral under SemGroup's senior secured revolving credit facility.  Rose Rock's senior unsecured notes were assumed by SemGroup.  See Note 9 for additional information related to changes in long-term debt and Note 15 for changes related to the Guarantor financial information.

    EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS,   Continued  

White Cliffs Pipeline, L.L.C. 
  Certain unaudited summarized income statement information of White Cliffs Pipeline, L.L.C. ("White Cliffs") for the   three months and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is shown below (in thousands): 

The equity in earnings of White Cliffs for the   three months and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , is less than   51%   of the net income of White Cliffs for the same periods. This is due to certain general and administrative expenses we incur in managing the operations of White Cliffs that the other owners are not obligated to share. Such expenses are recorded by White Cliffs and are allocated to our ownership interest. White Cliffs recorded   $0.3 million   and   $0.4 million   of such general and administrative expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. White Cliffs recorded   $1.2 million   and   $1.1 million   of such general and administrative expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  The members of White Cliffs are required to contribute capital to White Cliffs to fund various projects.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we contributed   $2.2 million   to complete an expansion project that added approximately   65,000   barrels per day of capacity.  
  NGL Energy Partners LP 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we no longer own common units representing limited partner interests in NGL Energy Partners LP (NYSE: NGL) ("NGL Energy").  On April 27, 2016, we sold all of our NGL Energy limited partner units for   $13.00   per unit and recorded a   $9.1 million   gain on disposal.  We continue to hold an   11.78%   interest in the general partner of NGL Energy which is being accounted for under the equity method in accordance ASC 323-30-S99-1, as our ownership is in excess of the 3 to 5 percent interest which is generally considered to be more than minor. 
  The general partner of NGL Energy is not a publicly traded company.  The information below pertains to our general partner interest, and previously held limited partner interest, in NGL Energy. 
  See Note 4 for discussion of the other-than-temporary impairment of our common unit investment in NGL Energy. 
  Under the equity method, our policy is to record our equity in earnings of NGL Energy on a one-quarter lag, as we do not expect to have information on the earnings of NGL Energy in time to consistently record the earnings in the quarter in which they are generated.  
  During the nine months ended June 30, 2016, NGL issued common units which diluted our limited partnership interest.  As we record activity on a one-quarter lag, we recognized a non-cash loss of   $41.0 thousand   associated with these issuances for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  During 2015, NGL announced several transactions in which it issued common units publicly and privately which diluted our limited partnership interest. As such, we recognized non-cash gains of   $6.0 million   associated with these issuances for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .

    EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS,   Continued  

During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we sold   1,999,533   of our NGL Energy common units for   $56.3 million  , net of related costs of   $0.5 million  .  We recorded net gains related to these sales of   $14.5 million   in "other expense (income)" in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  Glass Mountain Pipeline, LLC 
  We own a   50%   interest in Glass Mountain Pipeline, LLC ("Glass Mountain"), which we account for under the equity method. The excess of the recorded amount of our investment over the book value of our share of the underlying net assets represents equity method goodwill and capitalized interest at   September 30, 2016  . Capitalized interest is amortized as a reduction of earnings from equity method investments. 
  Certain unaudited summarized income statement information of Glass Mountain for the   three months and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is shown below (in thousands): 

The equity in earnings of Glass Mountain for the   three months and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , reported in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) is less than   50%   of the net income of Glass Mountain for the same period due to amortization of capitalized interest for the period. 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we contributed   $0.3 million   to Glass Mountain related to capital projects.

    IMPAIRMENTS 
     SemGas goodwill impairment 
  In March 2016, our SemGas segment revised the volume forecast for its northern Oklahoma system based on revised volume forecasts provided by certain producers who have chosen to adjust plans for production following release of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission s Regional Earthquake Response Plan that curtails the amount of volume that can be injected into disposal wells.   
  Based on the reduction to our forecast, we tested our SemGas segment's long-lived assets, finite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment at March 31, 2016.  No impairment was indicated for SemGas' long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis.  However, we did record an impairment of SemGas' goodwill for the entire balance of   $13.1 million  . 
  To test the goodwill for impairment, we used an income approach, supplemented by a market approach to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit.  Under the income approach, we utilized a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of our SemGas operations.  Significant judgments and assumptions included the discount rate, anticipated revenue and volume growth rates, estimated operating expenses and capital expenditures, which were based on our operating and capital budgets as well as our strategic plans.  A significant underlying assumption is that commodity prices will eventually improve, water disposal issues will be resolved and production volumes will begin to increase.  If production does not increase in the future or the production takes longer than anticipated to return, this would negatively affect our key assumptions and potentially lead to finite-lived intangible and long-lived asset impairments in the future.  We considered the market approach by comparing the revenue and earnings multiples implied by our income approach to those of comparable companies for reasonableness.

  4.    IMPAIRMENTS,   Continued 

Other-than-temporary impairment of equity method investment in NGL Energy 
  During the fourth quarter of 2015, the market price of NGL Energy common units fell below our carrying value per unit and remained below our carrying value as of March 31, 2016.  At December 31, 2015, in accordance with ASC 320-10-S99  Investments - Debt and Equity Securities , we assessed whether such decline in value was other-than-temporary.  During this initial assessment, the decrease in value was determined not to be other-than-temporary.  The evidence management considered in such assessment included the nature and volatility of such decline, as well as the latest public financial guidance, condition, and results of NGL Energy.  Subsequently, we continued to monitor events and developments and, based on NGL Energy's April 21, 2016, announcement of a reduction in its quarterly distribution and lowering of financial performance guidance, we concluded that the decline in the value of our investment is other-than-temporary as of March 31, 2016.  As such, we recorded an impairment of   $39.8 million   to our investment in the limited partner units of NGL Energy for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The value of our limited partner investment in NGL Energy was written-down to the market price of   $11.04   on December 31, 2015, the date through which we have recorded our equity in earnings as discussed in Note 3.  See Note 3 for discussion of the sale of our NGL Energy limited partner units on April 27, 2016. 
  Our investment in the general partner of NGL Energy is not considered to be impaired.  There is no readily available market price for our general partner investment as these units are not publicly traded.  Based on the relatively low book value of our general partner investment, the value of incentive distribution rights and comparable general partner transactions, we do not believe our investment in the general partner of NGL Energy is impaired. 
  Crude Transportation assets 
  In the fourth quarter of 2016, we began an evaluation of strategic alternatives related to certain assets in our Crude  Transportation segment.  The outcome of such review may result in a material non-cash impairment. 

Our businesses are organized based on the nature and location of the services they provide. Certain summarized information related to our reportable segments is shown in the tables below.  None of the operating segments have been aggregated.  Although Corporate and Other does not represent an operating segment, it is included in the tables below to reconcile segment information to that of the consolidated Company.  Eliminations of transactions between segments are also included within Corporate and Other in the tables below. 
  The accounting policies of each segment are the same as the accounting policies of the consolidated Company. Transactions between segments are generally recorded based on prices negotiated between the segments.  Certain general and administrative expenses incurred at the corporate level were allocated to the segments based on our allocation policies in effect at the time. 
  Our equity investment in NGL Energy was previously included within the SemStream segment.  However, in the second quarter of 2016, we disposed of our limited partner interest in NGL Energy.  Subsequent to this disposal, amounts related to our remaining general partner investment in NGL Energy are not material and are not expected to be material for the foreseeable future.  As our investment in NGL Energy is the only asset of SemStream, we have ceased to report SemStream as a segment.  Prior period amounts have been recast to include the former SemStream balances as part of Corporate and Other.  See Note 3 for additional information. 
  During the year ended December 31, 2015, management made the decision to disaggregate certain activities and functions within the domestic crude oil business to provide additional granularity, both internally and externally, to our operating results.  As such, the prior period results of the former Crude segment have been recast to reflect the resulting reportable segments: Crude Transportation, Crude Facilities and Crude Supply and Logistics.  Certain amounts formerly included in the Crude segment have been included in Corporate and Other in the current presentation.  No other segments were impacted.  Additionally, current year activity includes intersegment revenues generated by our Crude Transportation and Crude Facilities segments for services provided to our Crude Supply and Logistics segment.  With the exception of intersegment trucking revenues of our Crude Transportation segment, these intersegment charges did not exist in the prior year.

    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
     Fair value of financial instruments 
  We record certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value at each balance sheet date. The tables below summarize the balances of commodity derivative assets and liabilities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands):

*Relates primarily to exchange traded futures. Gain and loss positions on multiple contracts are settled net on a daily basis with the exchange. 
  "Level 1" measurements are based on inputs consisting of unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. These include commodity futures contracts that are traded on an exchange.  
  "Level 2" measurements are based on inputs consisting of market observable and corroborated prices for similar derivative contracts. Assets and liabilities classified as Level 2 include over the counter ("OTC") traded physical fixed priced purchases and sales forward contracts. 
  "Level 3" measurements are based on inputs from a pricing service and/or internal valuation models incorporating observable and unobservable market data.  These include commodity derivatives, such as forwards and swaps for which there is not a highly liquid market and therefore are not included in Level 2 above.  
  Financial assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value levels. At   September 30, 2016  , all of our physical fixed price forward purchases and sales contracts were being accounted for as normal purchases and normal sales. 
  There were no financial assets or liabilities recorded at fair value which were classified as Level 2 or Level 3 during the   three months and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  As such, no rollforward of Level 3 activity has been presented. 
  Commodity derivative contracts 
  Our consolidated results of operations and cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for petroleum products. This exposure to commodity price risk is managed, in part, by entering into various commodity derivatives. 
  We seek to manage the price risk associated with our marketing operations by limiting our net open positions through (i) the concurrent purchase and sale of like quantities of petroleum products to create back-to-back transactions that are intended to lock in positive margins based on the timing, location or quality of the petroleum products purchased and delivered or (ii) derivative contracts. Our storage and transportation assets can also be used to mitigate time and location basis risks, respectively. All marketing activities are subject to our Comprehensive Risk Management Policy, which establishes limits in order to manage risk and mitigate financial exposure. 
  Our commodity derivatives can be comprised of swaps, futures contracts and forward contracts of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. These are defined as follows: 
  Swaps     OTC transactions where a floating price, basis or index is exchanged for a fixed (or a different floating) price, basis or index at a preset schedule in the future, according to an agreed-upon formula.  
  Futures contracts     Exchange traded contracts to buy or sell a commodity. These contracts are standardized by the exchange in terms of quality, quantity, delivery period and location for each commodity. 
  Forward contracts     OTC contracts to buy or sell a commodity at an agreed upon future date. The buyer and seller agree on specific terms (price, quantity, delivery period and location) and conditions at the inception of the contract. 
  The following table sets forth the notional quantities for commodity derivative instruments entered into (in thousands of barrels):

We have not designated any of our commodity derivative instruments as accounting hedges. We have recorded the fair value of our commodity derivative instruments on our condensed consolidated balance sheets in other current assets and other current liabilities in the following amounts (in thousands): 

We have posted margin deposits as collateral with brokers who have the right of set off associated with these funds. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our margin deposit balances were in a net asset position of   $8.9 million   and   $2.9 million  , respectively.  These margin account balances have not been offset against our net commodity derivative instrument (contract) positions. Had these margin deposits been netted against our net commodity derivative instrument (contract) positions as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, we would have had net asset positions of   $2.5 million   and   $2.6 million  , respectively.  
  Realized and unrealized gains (losses) from our commodity derivatives were recorded to product revenue in the following amounts (in thousands):   

  Concentrations of risk 
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  ,   one   third-party customer of our Crude Supply and Logistics segment accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues at approximately   20%  .   No   suppliers accounted for more than 10% of our costs of products sold.  
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   one   third-party customer of our Crude Supply and Logistics segment accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues at approximately   29%  .   No   suppliers accounted for more than 10% of our costs of products sold. 
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   one   third-party customer, primarily of our Crude Supply and Logistics segment, accounted for approximately   21%   of our consolidated accounts receivable. 

8.  
    INCOME TAXES 
     The effective tax rate was   250%   and   51%   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and   58%   and   40%   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Significant items that impacted the effective tax rate for each period, as compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate of   35%  , include earnings in foreign jurisdictions taxed at lower rates and a non-controlling interest in Rose Rock for which taxes are not provided. Further, the foreign earnings are taxed in foreign jurisdictions as well as in the U.S., since they are disregarded entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These combined factors, and the magnitude of the permanent items impacting the tax rate relative to income from continuing operations before income taxes result in rates that are not comparable between the periods. 
  We have a valuation allowance on a small portion of our state net operating loss carryovers with shorter carryover periods and our foreign tax credit carryover.  We have not released the valuation allowance on the foreign tax credits due to the foreign tax credit limitation and the relative subjectivity of forecasts of the relational magnitude of U.S. and foreign taxable income in future periods, as well as the shorter carryover period available for the credits.  Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when a determination is made that it is more likely than not that some, or all,

    INCOME TAXES,   Continued 

of the deferred tax assets will not be realized based on the weight of all available evidence. Evidence which is objectively verifiable carries a higher weight in the analysis. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character within the carryback and carryforward period available under the tax law. Sources of taxable income include future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future earnings and available tax planning strategies.  
  We have analyzed filing positions in all of the federal, state and foreign jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns and determined that no accruals related to uncertainty in tax positions are required.  All income tax years of the Company ending after the emergence from bankruptcy remain open for examination in U.S. jurisdictions under general operation of the statute of limitations, including special provisions with regard to net operating loss carryovers.  In foreign jurisdictions, all tax periods prior to the emergence from bankruptcy are closed. The statute of limitations has not been waived with respect to any foreign jurisdictions post emergence and tax periods are open for examination in accordance with the general statutes of each foreign jurisdiction.  Currently, there are no examinations in progress for our federal and state jurisdictions.  Canada Revenue Agency has initiated an income tax audit of SemCAMS ULC for the tax years 2013 and 2014. No other foreign jurisdictions are currently under audit.

    LONG-TERM DEBT 
     Our long-term debt consisted of the following (in thousands): 

Senior unsecured notes due 2021 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we incurred   $5.8 million   and   $5.8 million  , respectively, of interest expense related to   $300 million   of   7.50%   senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the "2021 Notes") including amortization of debt issuance costs.   For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we incurred   $17.5 million   and   $17.5 million  , respectively, of interest expense related to the 2021 Notes including amortization of debt issuance costs.

Senior unsecured notes due 2022 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding   $400 million   of   5.625%   senior unsecured notes due 2022 (the "2022 Notes").  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we incurred   $5.9 million   and   $5.9 million  , respectively, of interest expense related to the 2022 Notes including amortization of debt issuance costs. For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we incurred   $17.7 million   and   $17.6 million  , respectively, of interest expense related to the 2022 Notes including amortization of debt issuance costs.  
  Senior unsecured notes due 2023 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding   $350 million   of   5.625%   senior unsecured notes due 2023 (the  2023 Notes ), which were issued on May 14, 2015.  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we incurred   $5.2 million   and   $5.2 million  , respectively, of interest expense related to the 2023 Notes including amortization of debt issuance costs and discount.  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we incurred   $15.6 million   and   $7.9 million  , respectively, of interest expense related to the 2023 Notes including amortization of debt issuance costs and discount.  
  Corporate revolving credit facility 
  On September 30, 2016, we amended and restated our corporate revolving credit facility, such that the borrowing capacity was increased to   $1.0 billion   and the maturity was extended to March 15, 2021. We capitalized   $7.5 million   of costs related to the credit facility in "other assets" in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. We may request an increase of borrowing capacity under the agreement up to   $300 million  . 
  The credit agreement includes the following financial performance covenants: 
             
    SemGroup s leverage ratio may not exceed   5.50   to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter;  
                
    SemGroup s senior secured leverage ratio may not exceed   3.50   to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter; and  
                
    SemGroup s interest coverage ratio may not be less than   2.50   to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. 
     The corporate revolving credit facility is guaranteed by all of SemGroup s material domestic subsidiaries and secured by a lien on substantially all of the property and assets of SemGroup and the other loan parties, subject to customary exceptions.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   no   outstanding cash borrowings on our   $1.0 billion   revolving credit facility. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding letters of credit under the facility of   $37.5 million  , for which the rate in effect was   2.0%  , and outstanding secured bi-lateral letters of credit of   $11.0 million  , for which the rate in effect was   1.75%  .  Secured bi-lateral letters of credit are external to the facility and do not reduce availability for borrowing on the credit facility. 
  We incurred interest expense related to the corporate revolving credit facility of   $0.8 million   and   $0.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, including letters of credit and amortization of debt issuance costs. We incurred interest expense related to the corporate revolving credit facility of   $3.4 million   and   $2.8 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, including letters of credit and amortization of debt issuance costs.  
  Rose Rock revolving credit facility 
  At   September 30, 2016  , Rose Rock's revolving credit facility was terminated and   $2.0 million   of associated unamortized capitalized loan fees were written off to interest expense. 
  We incurred   $3.8 million   and   $1.4 million   of interest expense related to this facility during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, including letters of credit and amortization of debt issuance costs. We incurred   $6.9 million   and   $5.6 million   of interest expense related to this facility during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, including letters of credit and amortization of debt issuance costs.

SemMexico revolving credit facility 
  At   September 30, 2016  , SemMexico had a   $100 million   Mexican pesos (U.S.   $5.1 million   at the   September 30, 2016   exchange rate) revolving credit facility, which matures in May 2018.  There were   no   outstanding borrowings on the facility at   September 30, 2016  .  Borrowings are unsecured and bear interest at the bank prime rate in Mexico plus   1.50%  . 
  At   September 30, 2016  , SemMexico had an outstanding letter of credit of   $292.8 million   Mexican pesos (U.S.   $15.0 million   at the   September 30, 2016   exchange rate).  The letter of credit was issued for a fee of   0.28%  . 
  Capitalized interest 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we capitalized interest of   $2.0 million   and   $1.0 million  , respectively. 
  Fair value 
  We estimate the fair value of the 2021 Notes, the 2022 Notes and the 2023 Notes to be   $302 million  ,   $367 million   and   $319 million  , respectively, at   September 30, 2016  , based on unadjusted, transacted market prices near the measurement date, which are categorized as Level 2 measurements.

    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
     Bankruptcy matters 
  On July 22, 2008 (the "Petition Date"), SemGroup, L.P. and certain subsidiaries filed petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Also on July 22, 2008, SemGroup, L.P.'s Canadian subsidiaries filed for creditor protection in Canada. Later during 2008, certain other U.S. subsidiaries filed petitions for reorganization. While in bankruptcy, SemGroup, L.P. filed a plan of reorganization with the court, which was confirmed on October 28, 2009 (the "Plan of Reorganization"). The Plan of Reorganization determined, among other things, how pre-Petition Date obligations would be settled, the equity structure of the reorganized company upon emergence and the financing arrangements upon emergence. SemGroup Corporation emerged from bankruptcy protection on November 30, 2009 (the "Emergence Date"). 
  Claims reconciliation process 
  A large number of parties made claims against us for obligations alleged to have been incurred prior to our predecessor's bankruptcy filing. We have resolved or settled all of these outstanding claims and have made all required distributions. The Plan of Reorganization has therefore been fully administered. On November 7, 2014, SemGroup Corporation and the other reorganized debtors moved for a final decree from the bankruptcy court closing the debtors  bankruptcy cases. The United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware granted the request and entered its Order Granting Motion of Remaining Debtors for Entry of Final Decree on December 18, 2014. Accordingly, the bankruptcy cases for SemCrude, L.P., Eaglwing, L.P., SemCanada II, L.P., SemCanada L.P., SemGas, L.P., SemGroup, L.P., SemMaterials, L.P., and SemStream, L.P. have been closed. As part of its decree, the Court retained jurisdiction over certain on-going adversary proceedings, but the debtors have estimated and paid the claims associated with these remaining adversaries, leaving the non-debtor parties to the adversaries to resolve their remaining claims amongst themselves. On January 2, 2015, Bettina M. Whyte, the duly appointed Trustee of the SemGroup Litigation Trust (the  Litigation Trustee ), filed a notice of appeal of the Bankruptcy Court s December 18, 2014 order closing the aforementioned bankruptcy cases. However, the Bankruptcy Court s order of final decree was effective upon entry, and the appeal does not stay the effect of the order. On September 30, 2016, the Litigation Trustee s appeal to the United States District Court for the District of Delaware was dismissed by mutual agreement of the parties and the matter is now concluded.

  An employee of Rose Rock Midstream Field Services, LLC was involved in a tractor trailer accident on January 15, 2015, in Dimmit County, Texas.  A second accident followed resulting in six fatalities and multiple injuries.  Multiple lawsuits involving claims of wrongful death and personal injury were filed in Zavala County and Dimmit County, Texas.  These lawsuits have been consolidated in the District Court, 293rd Judicial District, Zavala County, Texas, as cause number 15-01-13356-ZCV, Maribel Rodriguez and the Estate of David Rodriguez, et al., vs. Rose Rock Midstream Field

Services, LLC, SemGroup Corporation, Rose Rock Midstream, L.P. and SemManagement, L.L.C., et al.  Confidential settlement agreements have been entered into with all plaintiffs and were approved by the court.  A motion for summary judgment on pending claims with one defendant/cross-plaintiff was granted.  A defendant/counter-plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial which was denied.  The judgments previously entered on the confidential settlement agreements will become final in the fourth quarter 2016 or first quarter 2017 if no further appeals are filed. We believe that any liability that may arise from this action will be within the limits covered by our insurance.  We will continue to defend our position, however we cannot predict the outcome. 
  Environmental 
  We may, from time to time, experience leaks of petroleum products from our facilities and, as a result of which, we may incur remediation obligations or property damage claims. In addition, we are subject to numerous environmental regulations. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in the assessment of fines or penalties by regulatory authorities. 
  The Kansas Department of Health and Environment ("the KDHE") initiated discussions during our bankruptcy proceeding regarding   six   of our sites in Kansas (  five   owned by Crude Transportation and   one   owned by SemGas) that KDHE believed, based on their historical use, may have had soil or groundwater contamination in excess of state standards. KDHE sought our agreement to undertake assessments of these sites to determine whether they are contaminated. We reached an agreement with KDHE on this matter and entered into a Consent Agreement and Final Order with KDHE to conduct environmental assessments on the sites and to pay KDHE s costs associated with their oversight of this matter. We have conducted Phase II investigations at all sites.    Four   sites are in various stages of follow up investigation, remediation, monitoring, or closure under KDHE oversight.  The environmental work at these sites is being completed under consent orders between Rose Rock Midstream Crude, L.P. and the KDHE.   Two   of the remaining sites have limited impacts to shallow soil and groundwater and the groundwater is currently being monitored on a semi-annual basis until such time that closure can be granted by the KDHE.  No active remediation is anticipated for these   two   sites.  The final   two   sites have required additional investigation and soil and groundwater remediation may be necessary to achieve KDHE closure. We do not anticipate any penalties or fines for these historical sites. 
  We received a Notice of Probable Violation and Civil Penalty dated March 29, 2016, from the U.S. Department of Transportation (the  Notice ) for alleged violations of pipeline operation and maintenance regulations related to a 2014 crude oil release that occurred on our Blackwell to See pipeline segment located in Oklahoma.  This pipeline segment was idled in March 2016 when we initiated service on our new pipeline segment that transports Kansas crude volumes to our Cushing, Oklahoma terminal.  The Notice proposes a penalty of   $600,200  . We responded to the Notice in April 2016 with information that we believe warrants reduction of the amount of the proposed penalty. 
  Other matters 
  We are party to various other claims, legal actions, and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of our management, the ultimate resolution of these claims, legal actions and complaints, after consideration of amounts accrued, insurance coverage and other arrangements, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, the outcome of such matters is inherently uncertain, and estimates of our consolidated liabilities may change materially as circumstances develop. 
  Asset retirement obligations 
  We will be required to incur significant removal and restoration costs when we retire our natural gas gathering and processing facilities in Canada.  At   September 30, 2016  , we have an asset retirement obligation liability of   $18.5 million  , which is included within other noncurrent liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. This amount was calculated using the   $124.9 million   cost we estimate we would incur to retire these facilities, discounted based on our risk-adjusted cost of borrowing and the estimated timing of remediation. 
  The calculation of the liability for an asset retirement obligation requires the use of significant estimates, including those related to the length of time before the assets will be retired, cost inflation over the assumed life of the assets, actual remediation activities to be required, and the rate at which such obligations should be discounted. Future changes in these estimates could result in material changes in the value of the recorded liability. In addition, future changes in laws or regulations could require us to record additional asset retirement obligations.

Our other segments may also be subject to removal and restoration costs upon retirement of their facilities. However, we are unable to predict when, or if, our pipelines, storage tanks and other facilities would become completely obsolete and require decommissioning. Accordingly, we have not recorded a liability or corresponding asset, as both the amount and timing of such potential future costs are indeterminable. 
  Purchase and sale commitments 
  We routinely enter into agreements to purchase and sell petroleum products at specified future dates. We account for derivatives at fair value with the exception of commitments which have been designated as normal purchases and sales for which we do not record assets or liabilities related to these agreements until the product is purchased or sold. At   September 30, 2016  , such commitments included the following (in thousands): 

Certain of the commitments shown in the table above relate to agreements to purchase product from a counterparty and to sell a similar amount of product (in a different location) to the same counterparty. Many of the commitments shown in the table above are cancellable by either party, as long as notice is given within the time frame specified in the agreement (generally   30   to   120   days). 
  Our SemGas segment has a take-or-pay contractual obligation related to the fractionation of natural gas liquids through June 2023. The approximate amount of future obligation is as follows (in thousands): 

SemGas also enters into contracts under which we are responsible for marketing the majority of the gas and natural gas liquids produced by the counterparties to the agreements.  The majority of SemGas  revenues were generated from such contracts. 
  Our Crude Supply and Logistics segment has a take-or-pay obligation with our equity method investee, White Cliffs, for approximately   5,000   barrels per day of space on White Cliffs' pipeline.  The agreement became effective in October 2015 and has a term of   5   years.  Annual payments to White Cliffs under the agreement are expected to be   $9.4 million  .

Equity issuances 
  On June 22, 2016, we issued and sold   8,625,000   shares of our Class A common stock, valued at   $27.00   per share, to the public for proceeds of   $228.5 million  , net of underwriting fees and other offering costs of   $4.3 million  . Proceeds were used to repay borrowings on our revolving credit facility and will be used for future capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. 
  On September 30, 2016, we completed the Merger with Rose Rock. We issued   13.1 million   common shares in exchange for the outstanding common limited partner units of Rose Rock which we did not already own.  In addition, we recorded a reduction to our deferred tax liabilities and offsetting increase to additional paid-in capital of   $144.0 million   associated with the transaction.  This non-cash adjustment represents the deferred tax impact of the difference between the book value of the noncontrolling interest acquired and the tax basis which is stepped-up to the fair market value of the consideration which includes the common shares issued and the  assumption of liabilities associated with the noncontrolling interest. See Note 2 for further information on the Merger.  
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   46,836   shares under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan and   161,518   shares related to our equity based compensation awards vested.  
  Equity-based compensation 
  At   September 30, 2016  , there were   919,069   unvested shares that have been granted under our director and employee compensation programs. The par value of these shares is not reflected in common stock on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, as these shares have not yet vested. For certain of the awards, the number of shares that will vest is contingent upon our achievement of certain specified targets. If we meet the specified maximum targets, approximately   405,000   additional shares could vest.  
  The holders of certain restricted stock awards are entitled to equivalent dividends ( UDs ) to be received upon vesting of the related restricted stock awards and will be settled in cash.  At   September 30, 2016  , the value of the UDs to be settled in cash related to unvested restricted stock awards was approximately   $428 thousand  . 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we granted   678,773   restricted stock awards with a weighted average grant date fair value of   $18.20   per award.  Included in the awards granted for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , is   128,585   restricted stock awards granted in exchange for Rose Rock equity based awards which were canceled as part of the Merger.  Incremental compensation expense was not significant.  Accrued unvested unit distribution rights associated with unvested Rose Rock restricted unit awards carried over the the restricted stock awards issued in the exchange. 
  Dividends 
  The following table sets forth the quarterly dividends per share declared and/or paid to shareholders for the periods indicated: 

Earnings per share is calculated based on income from continuing and discontinued operations less any income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents third-party limited

partner unitholders' interests in the earnings of our consolidated subsidiary, Rose Rock, prior to completion of the Merger.  Rose Rock allocated net income to its limited partners based on the distributions pertaining to the current period's available cash as defined by Rose Rock's partnership agreement. After adjusting for the appropriate period's distributions, the remaining undistributed earnings or excess distributions over earnings, if any, were allocated to Rose Rock's general partner, limited partners and participating securities in accordance with the contractual terms of Rose Rock's partnership agreement and as further prescribed under the two-class method. Incentive distribution rights did not participate in undistributed earnings.  Subsequent to the Merger, there will no longer be a noncontrolling interest. 
  Basic earnings per share is calculated based on the weighted average shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings per share includes the dilutive effect of unvested equity compensation awards. 
  The following summarizes the calculation of basic earnings per share for the   three months and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands, except per share amounts):

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we experienced a net loss attributable to SemGroup, as such the unvested equity compensation awards would have been antidilutive and, therefore, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share.

Other supplemental disclosures 
  In connection with our acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in Rose Rock, as discussed in Note 2, we recorded a reduction to our deferred tax liabilities and offsetting increase to additional paid-in capital of   $144.0 million   associated with the transaction.  This non-cash adjustment represents the deferred tax impact of the difference between the book value of the noncontrolling interest acquired and the tax basis which is stepped-up to the fair market value of the consideration which included the common shares issued and the assumption of liabilities associated with the noncontrolling interest.

    CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING GUARANTOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
       
  Our senior unsecured notes are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries as follows: Rose Rock Finance Corporation, Rose Rock Midstream Operating, LLC, Rose Rock Midstream Energy GP, LLC, Rose Rock Midstream Crude, L.P., Rose Rock Midstream Field Services, LLC, SemGas, L.P., SemMaterials, L.P., SemGroup Europe Holding, L.L.C., SemOperating G.P., L.L.C., SemMexico, L.L.C., SemDevelopment, L.L.C., Mid-America Midstream Gas Services, L.L.C., SemCrude Pipeline, L.L.C., Wattenberg Holding, LLC and Glass Mountain Holding, LLC (collectively, the "Guarantors").  
  Each of the Guarantors is   100%   owned by SemGroup Corporation (the "Parent").  Such guarantees of the SemGroup Notes are full and unconditional and constitute the joint and several obligations of the Guarantors.  There are no significant restrictions upon the ability of the Parent or any of the Guarantors to obtain funds from its respective subsidiaries by dividend or loan.  None of the assets of the Guarantors represent restricted net assets pursuant to Rule 4-08(e)(3) of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act.   
  Subsequent to the Merger as described in Note 2, SemGroup assumed the obligations of Rose Rock under Rose Rock's senior unsecured notes. Supplemental indentures were entered into with respect to the previously existing SemGroup senior unsecured notes and the senior unsecured notes assumed from Rose Rock to include the Guarantors as listed above to the extent the entity was not already a Guarantor.  Prior period comparative information has been recast to reflect the addition of Rose Rock subsidiaries as Guarantors. 
  Unaudited condensed consolidating financial statements for the Parent, the Guarantors and non-guarantors as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , and for the   three months and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , are presented on an equity method basis in the tables below (in thousands).   
  Intercompany receivable and payable balances, including notes receivable and payable, are capital transactions primarily to facilitate the capital needs of our subsidiaries.  As such, subsidiary intercompany balances have been reported as a reduction to equity on the condensed consolidating Guarantor balance sheets.  The Parent's net intercompany balance, including note receivable, and investments in subsidiaries have been reported in equity method investments on the condensed consolidating Guarantor balance sheets.  Intercompany transactions, such as daily cash management activities, have been reported as financing activities within the condensed consolidating Guarantor statements of cash flows.  The Parent's investing activities with subsidiaries, such as the drop down of Wattenberg Holding, LLC and Glass Mountain to Rose Rock in the first quarter of 2015, have been reflected as cash flows from investing activities.  Quarterly cash distributions from Rose Rock representing a return on capital have been included in the Parent's cash flows from operations.  These balances are eliminated through consolidating adjustments below.

Item 2.    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements and the notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , filed with the SEC. 

Overview of Business 
  Our business is to provide gathering, transportation, storage, distribution, marketing and other midstream services primarily to producers, refiners of petroleum products and other market participants located in the Midwest and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States of America (the "U.S.") and Canada. We, or our significant equity method investees, have an asset base consisting of pipelines, gathering systems, storage facilities, terminals, processing plants and other distribution assets located between North American production and supply areas, including the Gulf Coast, Midwest, Rocky Mountain and Western Canadian regions. We also maintain and operate storage, terminal and marine facilities at Milford Haven in the United Kingdom (the "U.K.") that enable customers to supply petroleum products to markets in the Atlantic Basin. We also operate a network of liquid asphalt cement terminals throughout Mexico. Our operations are conducted directly and indirectly through our primary business segments   Crude Transportation, Crude Facilities, Crude Supply and Logistics, SemGas       , SemCAMS, SemLogistics and SemMexico.  
  Our Assets 
  At   September 30, 2016  , our segments owned the following: 
             
    Crude Transportation operates crude oil pipelines and truck transportation businesses in the U.S. Crude Transportation s assets include: 
                
    a   410  -mile crude oil gathering and transportation pipeline system with over   630,000   barrels of associated storage capacity in Kansas and northern Oklahoma that is connected to several third-party pipelines and refineries; 
                
    the Wattenberg Oil Trunkline ("WOT"), a   75  -mile, 12-inch diameter crude oil gathering pipeline system that transports crude oil from production facilities in the DJ Basin to the pipeline owned by White Cliffs Pipeline, L.L.C. ("White Cliffs").  The WOT also has   360,000   barrels of operational storage;

Outlook and Recent Developments 
    
  We expect commodity prices to remain challenged and costs of capital to remain sharply higher throughout 2016 as compared to 2015.  Fee-based and take-or-pay arrangements are a significant component of our portfolio, which serve to somewhat reduce the influence of commodity price fluctuations on our operating results and cash flows. However, producer activities are being impacted by lower energy commodity prices which have reduced our volumes.  The credit profiles and financial prospects of certain of our producer customers have been challenged by the current market conditions, which ultimately may result in further reductions of our volumes, or in re-negotiation of certain contractual provisions affecting our revenues.  Such reductions as well as further or prolonged declines in energy commodity prices may result in non-cash impairments of our assets. 
  In that regard, in the fourth quarter we expect to finalize a contract renegotiation with a customer that would provide for a one-time incentive payment to ensure continued production of gas into one of our Canadian facilities.  The amended contract is also expected to provide certain claw-back provisions that, depending on production levels in future periods, would allow for the future recoupment of a portion of the incentive payment. 
  Certain of our producer customers operating in Oklahoma have chosen to adjust plans for production following the release of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission's Regional Earthquake Response Plan (the "OCC Plan") which curtails the amount of volume that can be injected into disposal wells.   
  On May 1, 2016, Midstates Petroleum Company, Inc. and Midstates Petroleum Company LLC (together,  Midstates ), a customer of our SemGas segment, announced that they filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.  While in bankruptcy, Midstates filed a First Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization ( Plan of Reorganization ), which was confirmed by the bankruptcy court on September 28, 2016, and effective October 21, 2016. In the Plan of Reorganization, Midstates assumed its contracts with SemGas. As a result, we do not currently expect this event to have a material impact on our financial condition or future results of operations. 
  On June 23, 2016, U.K. voters approved a referendum to leave the European Union ("EU").  It is currently unknown what, if any, impact this will have on our SemLogistics segment. Oil trading and storage is not expected to be significantly impacted as a whole.  However, SemLogistics receives and delivers products to the EU and tariffs and taxes related to these transactions could change subsequent to the U.K.'s exit from the EU.  Additionally, it is uncertain what changes in legislation will occur subsequent to the exit which could impact our business.  
  In October, SemCAMS announced an agreement that will include the processing of up to 120 MMcf/d of sour gas at a new 200 MMcf/d gas plant the company will construct in the Wapiti area of the Montney play in Alberta. The agreement is underpinned by 80% take-or-pay terms for a period of 15 years. Construction on the project is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2017, and the estimated total project cost is approximately $300 million to $350 million Canadian dollars.  
  In the fourth quarter of 2016, we began an evaluation of strategic alternatives related to certain assets in our Crude  Transportation segment.  The outcome of such review may result in a material non-cash impairment. 
  Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
  We define Adjusted gross margin as total revenues minus cost of products sold and unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives. Adjusted gross margin is not a financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations.  Operating income is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted gross margin.  Our non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. This non-GAAP financial measure has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some, but not all, items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. You should not consider Adjusted gross margin as a substitute for

     Table of Contents  

analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted gross margin may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility. 
  Management compensates for the limitation of Adjusted gross margin as an analytical tool by reviewing the comparable GAAP measure, understanding the difference between Adjusted gross margin on the one hand, and operating income on the other hand, and incorporating this knowledge into its decision-making processes. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measure that our management uses in evaluating our operating results.

Revenue and Expenses 
  Revenue and expenses are analyzed by operating segment below. 
  General and administrative expense 
  General and administrative expenses of each corporate department are allocated to the segments based on criteria such as actual usage, headcount and estimates of effort or benefit.  The method for allocating cost is based on the type of service being provided.  For example, internal audit costs are based on an estimate of effort attributable to a segment.  In contrast, accounting department costs are allocated based on the number of transactions processed for a given segment compared to the total number processed.

Interest expense  
  Interest expense   increased   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , to   $21.0 million   from   $19.2 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  Interest expense   increased   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , to   $58.8 million   from   $50.6 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The increase for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   is primarily due to the issuance of $350 million of 5.625% senior unsecured notes on May 14, 2015.   
  Loss (gain) on sale or impairment of equity method investment 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recognized a   $30.6 million   net loss on sale or impairment of equity method investment compared to a   $14.5 million   gain from sales of limited partner units of NGL Energy for the same period in   2015  .  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded a $39.8 million impairment to our equity method investment in NGL Energy based on a fair value of the common units being lower than the book value and NGL Energy's announced decreases in distributions and guidance, which was partially offset by a   $9.1 million   gain on the disposal of our remaining NGL Energy limited partner units in April 2016. 
  Income tax expense (benefit)   
  We reported an income tax benefit of   $4.9 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to an expense of   $29.6 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The effective tax rate was   250%   and   51%   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and   58%   and   40%   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Significant items that impacted the effective tax rate for each period, as compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%, include earnings in foreign jurisdictions taxed at lower rates and a non-controlling interest in Rose Rock for which taxes are not provided.  The foreign earnings are taxed in foreign jurisdictions as well as in the U.S., since they are disregarded entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These combined factors, and the magnitude of the permanent items impacting the tax rate relative to income from continuing operations before income taxes result in rates that are not comparable between the periods. 

Results of Operations by Reporting Segment 
  Crude Transportation 

Adjusted gross margin 
  Adjusted gross margin in this segment is generated by providing fee-based services, which are included in service revenue in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).  As there is no cost of sales or derivative activity associated with our Crude Transportation revenue, Adjusted gross margin is equivalent to revenue for this segment.  This segment's prior year revenue included product revenue related to certain commodity purchase and sales activity performed around our pipelines.  In the current year, these product revenues are reflected in the Crude Supply and Logistics segment and have been replaced in the Crude Transportation segment with intersegment transportation fees which have been charged to Crude Supply and Logistics and which are reported as service revenue.  With the exception of intersegment truck transportation charges, these intersegment charges did not exist in the prior year.

Three months ended September 30, 2016   versus   three months ended September 30, 2015    
  Revenue  
  Pipeline transportation revenue decreased to   $6.8 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $7.7 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  The change is due to a decrease in fixed margin activity which is now reported with other product revenues in the Crude Supply and Logistics segment and was replaced in the Crude Transportation segment with intersegment usage fees.  Beginning January 2016, Crude Transportation is charging Crude Supply and Logistics to move barrels through the pipeline system. This decrease was partially offset with a $0.9 million increase on the WOT. 
  Truck transportation revenue increased to   $16.1 million   in   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $15.7 million   for the same period in   2015   as a result of higher volumes.   
  Operating expense 
  Operating expense remained relatively constant at   $17.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $17.0 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  
  General and administrative expense 
  General and administrative expense decreased to   $1.2 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $2.1 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  The decrease is a result of a reduction in overhead allocation.    
  Depreciation and amortization expense  
  Depreciation and amortization expense decreased to   $6.3 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $9.0 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  The decrease is primarily due to approximately $3.5 million of prior year expense related to the reduction of the useful life of a 163-mile section of the Kansas and Oklahoma pipeline system.  
  Loss on disposal of long-lived assets, net 
  Crude Transportation recorded a loss on disposal of long-lived assets of   $1.0 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to a loss of   $27 thousand   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  The loss in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   is primarily due to a write down of vehicles in our trucking division. 
  Earnings from equity method investments 
  Crude Transportation s earnings from equity method investments decreased in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , to   $15.9 million   from   $17.1 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , due to a reduction in volume.  
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016   versus   nine months ended September 30, 2015    
  Revenue  
  Pipeline transportation revenue decreased to   $21.6 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $23.8 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The change is due to a decrease in fixed margin activity, which is now reported with other product revenues in the Crude Supply and Logistics segment and was replaced in the Crude Transportation segment with intersegment usage fees.  Beginning January 2016, Crude Transportation is charging Crude Supply and Logistics to move barrels through the pipeline system.  This decrease was partially offset with a $3.9 million increase on the WOT.   
  Truck transportation revenue decreased to   $46.6 million   in   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $49.6 million   for the same period in   2015   as a result of lower revenue per barrel.   
  Operating expense 
  Operating expense decreased to   $52.6 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $56.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The decrease included reductions to maintenance and repair of $3.4 million and allocated overhead of $2.9 million.  These costs were partially offset by increases in employment costs, insurance and taxes.   
  General and administrative expense 
  General and administrative expense decreased to   $3.4 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $6.5 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The decrease is a result of a reduction in overhead allocation of $3.4 million, partially offset with slight increases in insurance and taxes and outside services.

Depreciation and amortization expense  
  Depreciation and amortization expense decreased to   $18.3 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $26.7 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The decrease is primarily due to approximately $10.6 million of prior year expense related to the reduction of the useful life of a 163-mile section of the Kansas and Oklahoma pipeline system.  
  Loss on disposal of long-lived assets, net 
  Crude Transportation recorded a loss on disposal of long-lived assets of   $2.8 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to a loss of   $0.2 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The loss in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   consisted of a $1.7 million abandonment of a 13-mile section of the Kansas and Oklahoma pipeline system and a $0.9 million write down of vehicles in our trucking division.   
  Earnings from equity method investments 
  Crude Transportation s earnings from equity method investments decreased to   $53.8 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $55.7 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , due to a reduction in volume.  

Crude Facilities 

Adjusted gross margin 
  Adjusted gross margin in this segment is generated by providing fee-based services. Revenues from fee-based services are included in service revenue in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).  As there is no cost of sales or derivative activity associated with our Crude Facilities revenue, Adjusted gross margin is equivalent to revenue for this segment. 
  Three months ended September 30, 2016   versus   three months ended September 30, 2015    
  Revenue  
  Revenue increased to   $12.7 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $11.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  Effective January 2016, Crude Facilities began charging Crude Supply and Logistics for the use of storage and unloading facilities.  As a result, the increase was primarily due to intersegment pump-over activity of $1.5 million, the addition of intersegment storage of $1.2 million and intersegment unloading activity of $0.1 million.  These increases were partially offset by a reduction in third-party storage revenue of $0.9 million, as the average capacity used internally for crude oil operations and marketing activities increased to 1.3 million barrels from 1.1 million barrels and third-party unloading revenue of $0.8 million.   
  Operating expense 
  Operating expense increased to   $2.4 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $1.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , as a result of increased field expenses.  
  General and administrative expense 
  General and administrative expense remained relatively constant at   $0.7 million   for   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $0.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .

Depreciation and amortization expense  
  Depreciation and amortization expense increased to   $2.0 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $1.5 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  The increase was primarily due to incremental expense due to project completions between periods.  
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016   versus   nine months ended September 30, 2015    
  Revenue  
  Revenue increased to   $38.4 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $34.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  Effective January 2016, Crude Facilities began charging Crude Supply and Logistics for the use of storage and unloading facilities. As a result, the increase was primarily due to intersegment pump-over activity of $4.2 million, intersegment storage of $3.6 million and intersegment unloading activity of $0.3 million.  These increases were partially offset by a reduction in third-party storage revenue of $2.2 million, as the average capacity used internally for crude oil operations and marketing activities increased to 1.3 million from 1.1 million, and third-party unloading revenue of $2.0 million.  
  Operating expense 
  Operating expense showed a slight increase in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , at   $6.9 million   compared to   $6.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of an increase in field expense.  
  General and administrative expense 
  General and administrative expense increased to   $2.9 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $2.5 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , largely due to higher overhead expense allocations.  
  Depreciation and amortization expense  
  Depreciation and amortization expense increased to   $5.8 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $4.2 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The increase was primarily due to incremental expense due to project completions between periods.

  Gross product revenue increased in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , to   $862.2 million   from   $696.3 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  The increase was primarily due to an increase in the volume sold to 19.0 million barrels at an average sales price of $45 per barrel in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to volume sold of 14.5 million barrels at an average sales price of $48 per barrel in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Gross product revenue was reduced by   $690.5 million   and   $491.7 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 845-10-15,   "Nonmonetary Transactions".    ASC 845-10-15 requires that certain transactions -- those where inventory is purchased from a customer then resold to the same customer -- to be presented in the income statement on a net basis, resulting in a reduction of revenue and costs of products sold by the same amount.    
  Cost of products sold 
  Costs of products sold decreased in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , to   $167.3 million   (including $9.8 million of intersegment charges) from   $198.3 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015   (including $3.0 million of intersegment charges).

ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, in accordance with ASC 845-10-15. There was an increase in the barrels sold, as described above, combined with a decrease in the average per barrel cost of crude oil to $45 in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from $48 in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .   
  Adjusted gross margin 
  This segment's Adjusted gross margin decreased in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , to   $4.4 million   from   $6.3 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The decrease was primarily due to an increase in barrels sold, as described above, and offset by a lower spread between the acquisition and sale price for volumes of crude oil sold, as the excess of our average sales price per barrel over our average acquisition cost per barrel decreased to approximately $0.23 in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , from approximately $0.43 in the same period in   2015  .  The increase in volume was primarily due to crude oil blending and transactions related to contango market conditions. 
  Operating expense 
  Operating expense increased to   $0.9 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $0.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase is primarily due to higher employment costs.

Three months ended September 30, 2016   versus   three months ended September 30, 2015 
  Revenue 
  Revenue decreased in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , to   $60.1 million   from   $65.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  This decrease is the result of lower volume (28,068 MMcf versus 37,663 MMcf), and decreased gathering and processing fees ($13.5 million versus $15.1 million). The decrease in revenue was offset by an increase in the average natural gas NYMEX price of $2.81/mmbtu versus $2.77/mmbtu and the average NGL basket price to $0.66/gallon in the three months ended September 30, 2016, versus $0.57/gallon for the same period in 2015. The decrease in volume is primarily a result of decreased drilling and production in the area served by our gas plants in northern Oklahoma, which is caused by continued reduction in capital expenditures and new production. 
  Costs of products sold 
  Costs of products sold decreased in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , to   $33.1 million   from   $36.9 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . This decrease is primarily related to lower volume as described above. 
  Operating expense 
  Operating expense increased in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , to   $8.7 million   from   $8.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  This increase is due to higher maintenance and repairs, which were partially offset by decreases in equipment leasing and other field expenses. 
     General and administrative expense 
  General and administrative remained relatively constant for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Depreciation and amortization expense 
  Depreciation and amortization expense increased in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , to   $9.1 million   from   $8.6 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  The increase is primarily a result of incremental assets placed in-service since the prior year due to expansion in northern Oklahoma. 
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016   versus   nine months ended September 30, 2015    
  Revenue 
  Revenue decreased in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , to   $157.1 million   from   $198.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . This decrease is the result of lower prices, lower volume (88,470 MMcf versus 110,487 MMcf) and decreased gathering and processing fees ($37.3 million versus $45.3 million). The decrease in revenue was affected by a lower average natural gas NYMEX price of $2.29/mmbtu versus $2.80/mmbtu offset by higher average NGL basket price of $0.61/gallon versus $0.57/gallon for the same period in 2015.  The decrease in volume is primarily a result of decreased drilling and production in the area served by our gas plants in northern Oklahoma, which is caused by continued reduction in capital expenditures and new production.

Costs of products sold 
  Costs of products sold decreased in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , to   $84.9 million   from   $114.3 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  This decrease is primarily related to lower volume and prices as described above. 
  Operating expense 
  Operating expense decreased in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , to   $24.9 million   from   $25.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  This decrease is due primarily to lower field expenses, which were partially offset by an increase in maintenance and repairs. 
  General and administrative expense 
  General and administrative remained relatively constant for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Depreciation and amortization expense 
  Depreciation and amortization expense increased in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , to   $27.2 million   from   $23.1 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The increase is primarily a result of incremental assets placed in-service since the prior year due to expansion in northern Oklahoma. 
  Loss on disposal or impairment, net  
  Loss on disposal or impairment, net increased to   $13.1 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $1.9 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  This increase is primarily due to a $13.1 million goodwill impairment recorded at March 31, 2016. The prior year loss is due to the write down of certain gas gathering and compression assets in Kansas to their estimated net realizable value. 
   In March 2016, our SemGas segment revised the volume forecast for its northern Oklahoma system based on revised volume forecasts provided by certain producers who have chosen to adjust plans for production following release of the OCC Plan which curtails the amount of volume that can be injected into disposal wells. Based on the reduction to our forecast, we tested our SemGas segment's assets, finite-lived intangible and goodwill for impairment at March 31, 2016. No impairment was indicated for SemGas' long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis.  However, we did record an impairment of SemGas' goodwill for the entire balance of $13.1 million.  
  To test the goodwill for impairment, we used an income approach, supplemented by a market approach to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit. Under the income approach, we utilized a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of our SemGas operations.  Significant judgments and assumptions included the discount rate, anticipated revenue and volume growth rates, estimated operating expenses and capital expenditures, which were based on our operating and capital budgets as well as our strategic plans. A significant underlying assumption is that commodity prices will eventually improve, water injection issues will be resolved and production volumes will begin to increase. If production does not increase in the future or the production takes longer than anticipated to return, this would negatively affect our key assumptions and potentially lead to finite-lived intangible and long-lived asset impairments in the future. We considered the market approach by comparing the revenue and earnings multiples implied by our income approach to those of comparable companies for reasonableness.

Corporate and Other 

Corporate and Other is not an operating segment. This table is included to permit the reconciliation of segment information to that of the consolidated Company.  The amounts reported in the three months and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   above have been recast to include non-operating entities which were previously included in our SemCrude segment and the historical results of our former SemStream segment.  SemStream holds our equity method investment in NGL Energy which is no longer material subsequent to the April 2016 sale of our limited partner interest.  Earnings from equity method investments and gain (loss) on issuance of common units by equity method investee in the table above relate to our investment in NGL Energy. 
  Changes in revenue and costs of products sold in the table above are due to the elimination of intercompany purchases and sales which fluctuate based on volume of activity between the segments and related commodity pricing. The decrease in general and administrative expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   to   $25.3 million   from   $37.1 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   is due primarily to $10.0 million of business development expenses related to the Maurepas Pipeline and legal settlement expense of $2.4 million which were incurred in the first quarter of 2015.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Sources and Uses of Cash 
  Our principal sources of short-term liquidity are cash generated from our operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The consolidated cash balance on   September 30, 2016   was   $163.7 million  . Of this amount,   $38.2 million   was held in Canada and may be subject to tax if transferred to the U.S.  Potential sources of long-term liquidity include issuances of debt securities and equity securities and the sale of assets. Our primary cash requirements currently are operating expenses, capital expenditures and our quarterly dividends. In general, we expect to fund: 
             
    operating expenses, maintenance capital expenditures and cash dividends through existing cash and cash from operating activities; 
                
    expansion capital expenditures and any working capital deficits through cash on hand, borrowings under our credit facility and the issuance of debt securities and equity securities;  
                
    acquisitions through cash on hand, borrowings under our credit facility and the issuance of debt securities and equity securities; and 
                
    debt principal payments through cash from operating activities and refinancing when the credit facility becomes due. 
     Our ability to meet our financing requirements and fund our planned capital expenditures will depend on our future operating performance and distributions from our equity investments, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in our industry. In addition, we are subject to conditions in the debt and equity markets for any issuances of debt securities and equity securities.  There can be no assurance we will be able or willing to access the public or private markets in the future. If we would be unable or unwilling to access those markets, we could be required to restrict future expansion capital expenditures and potential future acquisitions. 
  We believe our cash from operations and our remaining borrowing capacity allow us to manage our day-to-day cash requirements, distribute our quarterly dividends and meet our capital expenditures commitments for the coming year. 
  Cash Flows

Adjustments to net income for non-cash expenses, net increased   $42.4 million   to   $138.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $95.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  This change is primarily a result of: 
             
    $45.2 million   increase due to the current year other-than-temporary impairment recorded on our limited partner investment in NGL Energy, partially offset by current year gain on the sale of our common limited partner units of NGL Energy, and prior year gains on the sale of a portion of our common limited partner units of NGL Energy, net of related costs;   
                
    $14.5 million   increase due to higher net losses on disposal or impairment primarily due to the impairment of our SemGas segment's goodwill in the current year;  
                
    $9.4 million   increase due to net unrealized losses related to our derivative instruments in the current year as compared to prior year net unrealized gains;  
                
    $6.1 million   increase due to prior year gains on the issuance of common units by NGL Energy, which did not reoccur in the current year;  
                
    $4.9 million   increase due to current year losses on foreign currency transactions as compared to prior year gains;  
                
    $4.7 million   increase due to lower equity earnings in the current year as compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower equity earnings as a result of the disposal of our common limited partner units of NGL Energy and lower earnings from Glass Mountain; and 
                
    $2.5 million   increase due to amortization of debt issuance costs including the write-off of costs related to the Rose Rock credit facility which was terminated. 
     These increases were offset by decreases due to: 
             
    $31.3 million   increase in deferred tax benefit; 
                
    $11.2 million   of decreased distributions from equity investments due to the disposal of our common limited partner units of NGL Energy; and 
                
    $1.2 million   due to inventory valuation adjustments in the prior year as a result of lower commodity prices. 
     All other adjustments to net income for non-cash expenses, net for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   remained relatively comparable to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  
  Changes in operating assets and liabilities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   generated a net increase in operating cash flows of   $0.8 million  .  The increase to operating cash flow due to the change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily a result of increases of   $22.1 million     in accounts payable and accrued liabilities   and decreases of   $2.4 million     in other current assets   and   $1.4 million     in receivables from affiliates  . These cash inflows were partially offset by cash outflows due to increases of   $14.4 million     in inventories  ,   $6.0 million   in derivatives and margin deposits and   $4.2 million     in accounts receivable  .  Changes in receivables, inventory, payables and accrued liabilities are primarily due to our segments' operating activities and are subject to the timing of purchases and sales and fluctuations in commodity pricing.  
  Changes in operating assets and liabilities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   generated a net decrease in operating cash flows of   $2.3 million  . The decrease to operating cash flow due to the change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily a result of increases of $23.3 million in inventories and $1.8 million in other current assets and decreases of $2.3 million in payables to affiliates, $3.8 million in payables to prepetition creditors and $1.3 million in other noncurrent liabilities.  These cash outflows were partially offset by decreases of $6.8 million in restricted cash, $8.2 million in accounts receivable, $9.0 million in receivables from affiliates, $1.8 million in other assets and $3.2 million in derivatives and margin deposits and an increase of $1.3 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.  Changes in receivables, inventory, payables and accrued liabilities are primarily due to our segments' operating activities and are subject to the timing of purchases and sales and fluctuations in commodity pricing.  Additionally, the increase in inventory is due, in part, to approximately 700 thousand additional barrels in storage compared to the beginning of the nine month period at our Crude Supply and Logistics segment.  This was partially due to a strategic build to capture margins due to forward market crude oil prices being higher than spot market prices.  Accounts receivable was also impacted by a $9.0 million decrease due to the collection of an accrued receivable at the beginning of the period which related to proceeds from the sale of a portion of our common limited partner units of NGL Energy.

Investing Activities 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we had   net cash outflows   of   $119.4 million   from investing activities, due primarily to   $199.0 million   of capital expenditures and   $3.8 million   of contributions to equity method investments, offset by investing cash inflows of   $60.5 million   in proceeds from the sale of our common limited partner units of NGL Energy and   $22.8 million   of distributions in excess of equity in earnings of affiliates.  Capital expenditures primarily related to the Maurepas Pipeline, crude oil pipeline projects, SemGas' Northern Oklahoma expansion projects and SemCAMS' Wapiti expansion.  Distributions in excess of equity in earnings of affiliates represent cash distributions from White Cliffs and Glass Mountain in excess of our cumulative equity in earnings and are accounted for as a return of investment. 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we had net cash outflows of   $308.5 million   from investing activities, due primarily to   $352.8 million   of capital expenditures and   $34.1 million   of contributions to equity method investments, offset by investing cash inflows of   $56.3 million   of net proceeds from the sale of our common limited partner units of NGL Energy and   $19.6 million   of distributions in excess of equity in earnings of affiliates.  Capital expenditures primarily related to crude oil pipeline projects, SemGas' Northern Oklahoma expansion projects, the Maurepas Pipeline and SemCAMS' Wapiti expansion. Contributions to equity method investments primarily represent investments to fund the White Cliffs pipeline expansion project. Distributions in excess of equity in earnings of affiliates represent cash distributions from White Cliffs and Glass Mountain in excess of our cumulative equity in earnings and are accounted for as a return of investment. 
  Financing Activities 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we had   net cash inflows   of   $89.1 million   from financing activities, which related to borrowings on credit facilities of   $362.5 million  , and proceeds from the issuance of common shares, net of offering costs, of   $223.7 million  , offset by principal payments on credit facilities of   $394.0 million  , dividends paid of   $63.3 million  , distributions to non-controlling interests of   $32.1 million   and debt issuance costs of   $7.5 million  . Net borrowings were used primarily for capital expenditures.  Proceeds from the issuance of common shares were used to repay borrowings on our credit facility and will be used for future capital expenditures and general corporate purposes.  Debt issuance costs related to the  increase and extension of our revolving credit facility. 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we had net cash inflows of   $277.0 million   from financing activities, which related to borrowings on long-term debt of   $802.2 million  , partially offset by principal payments of $525.0 million and   $89.1 million   in proceeds from the issuance of Rose Rock limited partner common units, offset by dividends paid of   $49.8 million  , distributions to non-controlling interests of   $29.8 million  ,   $6.3 million   in debt issuance costs and   $4.3 million   to repurchase common stock for payment of statutory taxes due on equity-based compensation.  Net borrowings were used primarily for capital expenditures and contributions to equity method investments. 
  Long-term Debt  
    Senior Unsecured Notes 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding $300 million of 7.5% senior unsecured notes due 2021, $400 million of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due 2022 and $350 million of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due 2023.  
    SemGroup Revolving Credit Facility 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   no   cash borrowings outstanding under our   $1.0 billion   revolving credit facility.  We had   $37.5 million   in outstanding letters of credit on that date. The maximum letter of credit capacity under this facility is $250 million. The facility can be increased up to $300 million.  The credit agreement expires on March 15, 2021. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had available borrowing capacity of $962.5 million under this facility. 
    SemMexico Credit Facilities 
  At   September 30, 2016  , SemMexico had   no   amounts outstanding on its $100 million Mexican pesos (U.S.   $5.1 million   at the   September 30, 2016   exchange rate) credit facility which matures in May 2018.  At   September 30, 2016  , SemMexico had an outstanding letter of credit of   $292.8 million   Mexican pesos (U.S.   $15.0 million   at the   September 30, 2016   exchange rate).  
  Shelf Registration Statement 
    We have access to a universal shelf registration statement which provides us with the ability to offer and sell an unlimited amount of debt and equity securities, subject to market conditions and our capital needs.  This shelf registration statement expires in March 2019.  On June 22, 2016, we issued and sold   8,625,000   shares of our Class A common stock, valued

     Table of Contents  

at   $27.00   per share, to the public for proceeds of   $228.5 million  , net of underwriting fees and other offering costs of   $4.3 million  . Proceeds were used to repay borrowings on our revolving credit facility and will be used for future capital expenditures and general corporate purposes.     
  Capital Requirements 
  The midstream energy business can be capital intensive, requiring significant investment for the maintenance of existing assets or acquisition or development of new systems and facilities. We categorize our capital expenditures as either: 
             
    expansion capital expenditures, which are cash expenditures incurred for acquisitions or capital improvements that we expect will increase our operating income or operating capacity over the long-term; or 
                
    maintenance capital expenditures, which are cash expenditures (including expenditures for the addition or improvement to, or the replacement of, our capital assets or for the acquisition of existing, or the construction or development of new, capital assets) made to maintain our long-term operating income or operating capacity. 
     Projected capital expenditures for   2016   are estimated at $295 million in expansion projects, including capital contributions to affiliates for funding growth projects and acquisitions, and $55 million in maintenance projects.  These estimates may change as future events unfold.  See "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we spent   $199.0 million   (cash basis) on capital projects and   $3.8 million   in capital contributions to equity method investees primarily for funding growth projects. 
  In addition to our budgeted capital program, we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expansion capital expenditures in the future. Consequently, our ability to develop and maintain sources of funds to meet our capital requirements is critical to our ability to meet our growth objectives. We expect that our future expansion capital expenditures will be funded by cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facility and the issuance of debt and equity securities. 
  SemGroup Dividends 
  The table below shows dividends declared and/or paid by SemGroup during 2015 and 2016. 

Credit Risk 
  We are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers. We examine the creditworthiness of third-party customers to whom we extend credit and manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis, credit approval, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and for certain transactions, we may request letters of credit, prepayments or guarantees. 
  Customer Concentration 
  Shell Trading   (US) Company, a customer of our Crude Supply and Logistics segment, accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue for the three months and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , at approximately   20%   and approximately   29%  , respectively.  Although we have contracts with customers of varying durations, if one or more of our major customers were to default on their contract, or if we were unable to renew our contract with one or more of these customers on favorable terms, we might not be able to replace any of these customers in a timely fashion, on favorable terms or at all. In any of these situations, our revenues and our ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders may be adversely affected. We expect our exposure to risk of non-payment or non-performance to continue as long as we remain substantially dependent on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of our Adjusted gross margin.

Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
     This discussion on market risks represents an estimate of possible changes in future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in commodity prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates. Our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur, and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates and the timing of transactions. 
  We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in (i) petroleum prices, particularly crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, (ii) interest rates and (iii) currency exchange rates. We may use from time-to-time various derivative instruments to manage such exposure. Our risk management policies and procedures are designed to monitor physical and financial commodity positions and the resulting outright commodity price risk as well as basis risk resulting from differences in commodity grades, purchase and sales locations and purchase and sale timing. We have a risk management function that has responsibility and authority for our Comprehensive Risk Management Policy, which governs our enterprise-wide risks, including the market risks discussed in this item. Subject to our Comprehensive Risk Management Policy, our finance and treasury function has responsibility and authority for managing exposure to interest rates and currency exchange rates. To manage the risks discussed above, we engage in price risk management activities. 
  Commodity Price Risk 
  The table below outlines the range of NYMEX prompt month daily settle prices for crude oil and natural gas futures, and the range of daily propane spot prices provided by an independent, third-party broker for the   three months and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   and the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

Revenue from our asset-based activities is dependent on throughput volume, tariff rates, the level of fees generated from our pipeline systems, capacity leased to third parties, capacity that we use for our own operational or marketing activities and the level of other fees generated at our terminalling and storage facilities. Profit from our marketing activities is dependent on  
  
   Page   59 

     Table of Contents  

our ability to sell petroleum products at prices in excess of our aggregate cost. Margins may be affected during transitional periods between a backwardated market (when the prices for future deliveries are lower than the current prices) and a contango market (when the prices for future deliveries are higher than the current prices). Our petroleum product marketing activities within each of our segments are generally not directly affected by the absolute level of petroleum product prices, but are affected by overall levels of supply and demand for petroleum products and relative fluctuations in market-related indices at various locations. 
  However, the SemGas segment has exposure to commodity price risk because of the nature of certain contracts for which our fee is based on a percentage of proceeds or index related to the prices of natural gas, natural gas liquids and condensate.  Given current volumes, liquid recoveries and contract terms, we estimate the following sensitivities over the next twelve months:  
             
    A 10% increase in the price of natural gas and natural gas liquids results in approximately a $2.6 million increase to Adjusted gross margin.  
                
    A 10% decrease in those prices would have the opposite effect.  
     This sensitivity may be impacted by changes in contract mix, change in production or other factors which are outside of our control.  
  Additionally, based on our open derivative contracts at   September 30, 2016  , an increase in the applicable market price or prices for each derivative contract would result in a decrease in the contribution from these derivatives to our crude oil sales revenues. A decrease in the applicable market price or prices for each derivative contract would result in an increase in the contribution from these derivatives to our crude oil sales revenues. However, the increases or decreases in crude oil sales revenues we recognize from our open derivative contracts are substantially offset by higher or lower crude oil sales revenues when the physical sale of the product occurs. These contracts may be for the purchase or sale of crude oil or in markets different from the physical markets in which we are attempting to hedge our exposure, or may have timing differences relative to the physical markets. As a result of these factors, our hedges may not eliminate all price risks. 
  The notional volumes and fair value of our commodity derivatives open positions as well as the change in fair value that would be expected from a 10% market price increase or decrease is shown in the table below (in thousands): 

Margin deposits or other credit support, including letters of credit, are generally required on derivative instruments used to manage our price exposure. As commodity prices increase or decrease, the fair value of our derivative instruments changes, thereby increasing or decreasing our margin deposit or other credit support requirements. Although a component of our risk-management strategy is intended to manage the margin and other credit support requirements on our derivative instruments, volatile spot and forward commodity prices, or an expectation of increased commodity price volatility, could increase the cash needed to manage our commodity price exposure and thereby increase our liquidity requirements. This may limit amounts available to us through borrowing, decrease the volume of petroleum products we purchase and sell or limit our commodity price management activities. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  We use variable rate debt and are exposed to market risk due to the floating interest rates on our credit facilities.   Therefore, from time-to-time we may use interest rate derivatives to manage interest obligations on specific debt issuances. Our variable rate debt bears interest at LIBOR or prime, subject to certain floors, plus the applicable margin. At   September 30, 2016  , an increase in these base rates of 1%, above the base rate floors, would increase our interest expense by   $0.1 million   and   $0.5 million   for the   three months and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. 
  The average interest rates presented below are based upon rates in effect at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The carrying value of the variable rate instruments in our credit facilities approximate fair value primarily because our rates fluctuate with prevailing market rates.

The following table summarizes our debt obligations: 

Currency Exchange Risk 
  The cash flows relating to our U.K., Canada and Mexico operations are based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in British pounds, Canadian dollars and Mexican pesos. Assets and liabilities of our U.K., Canadian and Mexican subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period. Revenue, expenses and cash flows are translated using the average exchange rate during the reporting period. 
  A 10% change in the average exchange rate during the   three months and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   would change operating income by $1.9 million and $4.7 million, respectively.

    Controls and Procedures 
     Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act), are effective as of   September 30, 2016  . This conclusion is based on an evaluation conducted under the supervision and participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer along with our management. Disclosure controls and procedures are those controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

  We may not realize the benefits we expect from the Rose Rock Merger.    
  We believe that the Rose Rock Merger will, among other things, be immediately accretive to our stockholders, simplify our corporate capital structure, improve our cost of capital and our capital market access and provide increased financial flexibility for execution of our strategic growth plan. However, our assessments and expectations regarding these anticipated benefits of the Rose Rock Merger may prove to be incorrect. Accordingly, there can be no assurance we will realize the anticipated benefits of the Rose Rock Merger.

Exhibit 

EXHIBIT 4.1  

SECOND SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE (this    Supplemental Indenture   ), dated as of September 30, 2016, among Rose Rock Finance Corporation, SemCrude Pipeline, L.L.C., Glass Mountain Holding, LLC, Rose Rock Midstream Operating, LLC, Rose Rock Midstream Energy GP, LLC, Rose Rock Midstream Crude, L.P., Rose Rock Midstream Field Services, LLC, Wattenberg Holding, LLC (each, a    Guaranteeing Subsidiary    and collectively, the    Guaranteeing Subsidiaries   ), a subsidiary of SemGroup Corporation (or its permitted successor), a Delaware corporation (the  Company ), the other Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined in the Indenture referred to herein) and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee under the Indenture referred to below (the  Trustee ). 
  W I T N E S S E T H 
  WHEREAS, the Company has heretofore executed and delivered to the Trustee a senior unsecured indenture (the    Base     Indenture   ), dated as of June 14, 2013 providing for the issuance of 7.50% Senior Notes Due 2021 (the    Notes    
  WHEREAS, the Company has heretofore executed and delivered to the Trustee a Supplemental Indenture, dated as of September 17, 2013 (the    First Supplemental Indenture   , the Base Indenture, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, the    Indenture   ) 
  WHEREAS, the Indenture provides that under certain circumstances the Guaranteeing Subsidiaries shall execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture pursuant to which the Guaranteeing Subsidiaries shall unconditionally guarantee all of the Company s Obligations under the Notes and the Indenture on the terms and conditions set forth herein (each, a    Subsidiary Guarantee    and 
  WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 901 of the Indenture, the Trustee is authorized to execute and deliver this Supplemental Indenture. 
  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, each Guaranteeing Subsidiary and the Trustee mutually covenant and agree for the equal and ratable benefit of the Holders of the Notes as follows: 
  1.    CAPITALIZED TERMS.  Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. 
  2.    AGREEMENT TO SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEES.  Each Guaranteeing Subsidiary hereby agrees to provide an unconditional Subsidiary Guarantee on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Subsidiary Guarantee and in the Indenture including but not limited to Article 12 thereof.  Each Subsidiary Guarantor, including each Guaranteeing Subsidiary, confirms that its Subsidiary Guarantee shall apply to the Company s obligations under the Indenture and the Notes after giving effect to the mergers of Rose Rock Midstream Holdings, LLC, Rose Rock Midstream GP, LLC, Rose Rock Midstream, L.P. and TMOL, LLC, in each case with and into the Company. 
  3.    NO RECOURSE AGAINST OTHERS.  No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, stockholder or agent of any Guaranteeing Subsidiary, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company or any Guaranteeing Subsidiary under the Notes, any Note Guarantees, the Indenture or this Supplemental Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation;   provided   that the foregoing shall not limit any of the Company s obligations under the Notes.  Each Holder of the Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability.  The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes.  Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy. 
  4.    GOVERNING LAW.  THIS SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. 
  5.    COUNTERPARTS.  The parties may sign any number of copies of this Supplemental Indenture.  Each signed copy shall be an original, but all of them together represent the same agreement. 

6.    EFFECT OF HEADINGS.  The Section headings herein are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof. 
  7.    THE TRUSTEE.  The Trustee shall not be responsible in any manner whatsoever for or in respect of the validity or sufficiency of this Supplemental Indenture or for or in respect of the recitals contained herein, all of which recitals are made solely by the Guaranteeing Subsidiary and the Company.[Supplemental Indenture (Additional Subsidiary Guarantees)]

  CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO SECTION 302 
  OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 
  I, Carlin G. Conner, certify that: 
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of SemGroup Corporation; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              a. 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b. 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              c. 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              d. 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              a. 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b. 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
