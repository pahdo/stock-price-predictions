  Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation       References to
 Fortune Brands,   the Company,   we,   our  and  us  refer to Fortune Brands Home   Security, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries as a whole, unless the context otherwise requires.  
 The Company is a leading home and security products company with a portfolio of leading branded products used for residential
home repair, remodeling, new construction and security applications.    The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of
September 30, 2016, the related condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the nine and three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and the related condensed consolidated statements of cash flows and equity for
the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary for a fair statement of the financial statements have been included.
Interim results may not be indicative of results for a full year.    The condensed consolidated financial statements and
notes are presented pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and do not contain certain information included in our annual consolidated financial statements and notes. The December 31, 2015 condensed
consolidated balance sheet was derived from the audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in
conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
 The condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q were derived principally from
the consolidated financial statements of the Company. In May 2015, we acquired Norcraft Companies, Inc. ( Norcraft ). The financial results of Norcraft were included in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive
income and statements of cash flow for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. In September 2015, we completed the sale
of Waterloo Industries, Inc. ( Waterloo ), our tool storage business. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) requirements, the results of operations of Waterloo were classified and separately stated as
discontinued operations in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2015. The cash flows from discontinued operations for the nine months ending
September 30, 2015 were not separately classified on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Information on Business Segments was revised to exclude these discontinued operations.

2.  
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards        Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and
Cash Payments     In September 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting
Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15 that will change how an entity classifies certain cash receipts and cash payments on its statement of cash flows. The key changes that may potentially impact our financial statements include the following:
1) Cash payments for debt prepayment or extinguishment costs should be classified as financing cash outflows; 2) Contingent consideration payments that are not made within three months after the consummation of a business combination would be
classified as financing (if payment made is up to the acquisition date fair value of liability) or operating outflows (if in excess of acquisition fair value). Cash payments made  soon after  the consummation of a business combination
generally will be classified as cash outflows for investing activities; 3) Insurance settlement proceeds, would be classified based on the nature of the loss; and 4) Company-owned life insurance settlement proceeds would be presented as investing
cash inflows, and premiums could be classified as investing or operating cash outflows, or a combination of both. The new standard is effective beginning January 1, 2018 and should be adopted retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are
assessing the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements.     Financial Instruments Credit Losses
    In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 that changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain
other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The new guidance applies to most financial assets measured at amortized cost, including trade and other receivables and loans as well as off-balance-sheet credit exposures
(e.g., loan commitments, standby letters of credit). The standard will replace the  incurred loss  approach under the current guidance with an  expected loss  model that requires an entity to estimate its lifetime  expected
credit loss . The new standard is effective beginning January 1, 2020 and early application is permitted but not earlier than January 1, 2019. We are assessing the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our financial
statements.

  Recently Issued Accounting Standards (Continued)         
   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09 that requires entities to recognize the income tax effects of share-based awards in
the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. The new standard also allows entities to withhold an amount up to an employee s maximum individual tax rate in the relevant jurisdiction without resulting in liability classification of
the award. The new standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2017. We early adopted this standard as of June 30, 2016.  
 We have reclassified $9.8 million and $13.8 million of employee withholding taxes paid from operating into financing activities
in the statement of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively, as required by ASU 2016-09 (adopted retrospectively).

  Recently Issued Accounting Standards (Continued)         
   Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting   
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07, which eliminates the requirement to apply the equity method of accounting
retrospectively when an entity obtains significant influence over a previously held investment. Previously, entities were required to retrospectively apply the equity method of accounting when obtaining significant influence over an investment (for
example due to an increase in ownership). The new standard is effective beginning January 1, 2017. Earlier application is permitted, however we elected not to early adopt. We do not expect this standard to have a material effect on our
financial statements.     Leases   
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases  that requires lessees to recognize almost all leases on their
balance sheet as a  right-of-use  asset and lease liability but recognize related expenses in a manner similar to current accounting. The guidance also eliminates current real estate-specific provisions for all entities. The new standard
is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 (calendar year 2019 for Fortune Brands) and earlier application is permitted. We are assessing the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements.
    Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   
 In January 2016, the FASB issued final guidance ASU 2016-01 that requires entities to measure investments in unconsolidated
entities (other than those accounted for using the equity method of accounting) at fair value through the income statement. There will no longer be an available-for-sale classification (with changes in fair value reported in Other Comprehensive
Income). In addition, the cost method is eliminated for equity investments without readily determinable fair values. The new standard is effective beginning January 1, 2018. Earlier application is permitted for certain provisions of the
standard, however we elected not to early adopt. We do not expect this standard to have a material effect on our financial statements.

Simplifying Subsequent Measurement of Inventory   
 In July 2015, the FASB issued a final standard that simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventory by replacing the current
standard of lower of cost or market test. Under the current guidance the subsequent measurement of inventory is measured at the lower of cost or market, where  market  may have multiple possible outcomes. The new guidance requires
subsequent measurement of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs to sell (completion, disposal, and
transportation). This new standard is effective for the annual period beginning January 1, 2017. Earlier application is permitted, however we elected not to early adopt. We do not expect this standard to have a material effect on our financial
statements.     Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern   
 In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a
Going Concern.  This ASU provides guidance about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. This
amendment is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016 (calendar year 2017 for Fortune Brands), and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted, however we elected not to early adopt.
We do not expect this standard to have a material effect on our financial statements.     Revenue from Contracts with Customers   
 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  This ASU clarifies the accounting
for revenue arising from contracts with customers and specifies the disclosures that an entity should include in its financial statements. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (calendar year
2018 for Fortune Brands). During the first half of 2016, the FASB issued the final amendments to the standard relating to the principal versus agent guidance, accounting for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance obligations
as well as the guidance on transition, collectability, noncash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes. The effective date and transition requirements for these amendments are the same as those of the new revenue
standard. We expect to complete our assessment of the impact of adoption in the second quarter of 2017 and finalize the adoption process of the new revenue standard by the end of 2017.

  Acquisitions       In September 2016, we acquired ROHL, a California-based
luxury plumbing company. In a related transaction, we also acquired TCL Manufacturing Ltd, which gave us 100% ownership of Perrin   Rowe, a UK manufacturer and designer of luxury kitchen and bathroom plumbing products. The total combined
purchase price was approximately $166 million (including $3 million of liabilities assumed), subject to certain post-closing adjustments. We financed the transaction using cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facilities. Net sales
and operating income in the three months ended September 30, 2016 were not material to the Company. The results of operations are included in the Plumbing segment.  
 In May 2016, we acquired Riobel, a Canadian plumbing company specializing in premium showroom bath and shower fittings, for a
total purchase price of $88.4 million in cash, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. We financed the transaction using cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facilities. Net sales and operating income in the nine and three
months ended September 30, 2016 were not material to the Company. The results of operations are included in the Plumbing segment.  
 In May 2015, we completed our tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Norcraft, a leading
publicly-owned manufacturer of kitchen and bathroom cabinetry, for a total purchase price of $648.6 million in cash. We financed the transaction using cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facilities. This transaction is expected to
strengthen our overall product offering, round out our regional market penetration and enhance our frameless cabinetry capabilities. The results of operations of Norcraft are included in the Cabinets segment. We incurred $15.1 million of Norcraft
acquisition-related transaction costs during the year ended December 31, 2015. The goodwill deductible for income tax purposes is $66.2 million.

4.  
  Acquisitions (Continued)         
  During the third quarter of 2016 and following the completion of the Norcraft
purchase accounting measurement period, the Company identified certain immaterial prior period balance sheet misstatements relating to calculation of deferred tax liabilities as disclosed in the purchase price allocation related to the Norcraft
acquisition. The correction of the cumulative misstatement during the third quarter of 2016 resulted in a $24.3 million and $15.4 million reduction in Norcraft s deferred tax liabilities and the carrying value of goodwill, respectively, and an
offsetting increase of $8.9 million in the uncertain tax positions accrual. The Company assessed the materiality of these misstatements on previously issued financial statements and concluded that the misstatements were not material to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for any interim or annual periods taken as a whole.    The following table summarizes the
final allocation of the purchase price to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the Norcraft acquisition.      

(a)  
    Net assets exclude $15.5 million of cash transferred to the Company as the result of the Norcraft acquisition.     
 Goodwill includes expected sales and cost synergies. Identifiable intangible assets consist of an indefinite-lived tradename of
$150 million and customer relationships of $210 million. The useful life of the customer relationships identifiable intangible asset was estimated to be 20 years.  
 The following unaudited pro forma summary presents consolidated financial information as if Norcraft had been acquired on
January 1, 2014. The unaudited pro forma financial information is based on historical results of operations and financial position of the Company and Norcraft. The pro forma results include:  

estimated amortization of a definite-lived customer relationship intangible asset (amortized using the straight-line method),        

the estimated cost of the inventory adjustment to fair value,        

interest expense associated with debt that would have been incurred in connection with the acquisition,        

adjustments to conform accounting policies.

  Acquisitions (Continued)         
  The unaudited pro forma financial information does not necessarily represent
the results that would have occurred had the Norcraft acquisition occurred on January 1, 2014. In addition, the unaudited pro forma information should not be deemed to be indicative of future results.  
   
   In March 2015, we acquired a Cabinets component company for approximately $6 million in cash.
This acquisition did not have a material impact on our financial statements.      

5.  
  Discontinued Operations       In September 2015, we completed the sale of
Waterloo for approximately $14 million in cash, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. We recorded a pre-tax loss of $16.9 million as the result of this sale. Transaction and other sale-related costs were approximately $2.8 million. The
estimated tax benefit on the sale was $26.5 million with the after-tax gain of $7.0 million recorded within discontinued operations. The estimated tax benefit resulted primarily from a tax loss in excess of the financial reporting loss as a result
of prior period nondeductible asset impairments. Waterloo is presented as a discontinued operation in our financial statements beginning January 1, 2015 and through the date of sale in accordance with ASC 205 requirements. Prior to classifying
Waterloo as a discontinued operation, it was reported in the Security segment.    The condensed consolidated statements of
comprehensive income and condensed consolidated balance sheets for all prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the presentation of Waterloo as discontinued operations.  
 The following table summarizes the results of discontinued operations for the nine and three months ended September 30,
2015.

  Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets       We had goodwill of $1,835.0
million and $1,755.3 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The $79.7 million increase was primarily due to the acquisitions in the Plumbing segment partially offset by the correction of Norcraft tax
misstatements as discussed in Note 4. The change in the net carrying amount of goodwill by segment was as follows:      

(a)    
  Net of accumulated impairment losses of $399.5 million in the Doors segment.     
 We also had identifiable intangible assets, principally tradenames, of $1,113.9 million and $996.7 million, net of accumulated
amortization, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The $140.7 million increase in gross identifiable intangible assets was primarily due to the acquisitions in our Plumbing segment.  
 The gross carrying value and accumulated amortization by class of identifiable intangible assets as of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015 were as follows:

6.  
  Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets (Continued)         
  Amortizable identifiable intangible assets, principally tradenames and
customer relationships, are subject to amortization over their estimated useful life, ranging from 3 to 30 years, based on the assessment of a number of factors that may impact useful life. These factors include historical tradename performance
with respect to consumer name recognition, geographic market presence, market share, plans for ongoing tradename support and promotion, customer attrition rates, and other relevant factors.  
 During the first nine months of 2016, no events or circumstances occurred that would have required us to perform interim
impairment tests of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.      

7.  
  External Debt and Financing Arrangements       In June 2016, the Company
amended and restated its credit agreement to combine and rollover the existing revolving credit facility and term loan into a new standalone $1.25 billion revolving credit facility. This amendment of the credit agreement was a non-cash transaction
for the Company. Terms and conditions of the credit agreement, including the total commitment amount, essentially remained the same. The revolving credit facility matures in June 2021 and borrowings thereunder will be used for general corporate
purposes. On September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our outstanding borrowings under these facilities, net of debt issuance costs relating to the term loan balance, were $695.0 million and $279.0 million, respectively. At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the current portion of long-term debt was zero. Interest rates under the facility are variable based on LIBOR at the time of the borrowing and the Company s long-term credit rating and can
range from LIBOR + 0.9% to LIBOR + 1.5%. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants under this facility. As a result of the refinancing, we wrote-off prepaid debt issuance costs of approximately $1.3
million as of June 30, 2016. We retrospectively adopted ASU 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,  on January 1, 2016, resulting in the reclassification of approximately $3 million of debt issuance costs
from other current assets and other assets to long-term debt as of December 31, 2015. Adoption of this new guidance did not impact the Company s equity, results of operations or cash flows.  
 In June 2015, we issued $900 million of unsecured senior notes ( Senior Notes ) in a registered public offering. The
Senior Notes consist of two tranches: $400 million of five-year notes due 2020 with a coupon of 3% and $500 million of ten-year notes due 2025 with a coupon of 4%. We used the proceeds from the Senior Notes offering to pay down our revolving credit
facility and for general purposes. On September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the outstanding amount of the Senior Notes, net of underwriting commissions, price discounts and debt issuance costs, was $890.8 million and $889.7 million,
respectively.

  External Debt and Financing Arrangements (Continued)         
  We currently have uncommitted bank lines of credit in China, which provide
for unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to $25.7 million in aggregate, of which zero and $0.8 million was outstanding, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. There were no borrowings in the nine and
three-month periods ended September 30, 2015.      

8.  
  Financial Instruments       We do not enter into financial instruments for
trading or speculative purposes. We principally use financial instruments to reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices used as raw materials in our products. The principal derivative financial instruments
we enter into on a routine basis are foreign exchange contracts. Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value. The counterparties to derivative contracts are major financial institutions. Management currently believes that the risk of
incurring material losses is unlikely and that the losses, if any, would be immaterial to the Company. In addition, from time to time, we enter into commodity swaps.  
 Our primary foreign currency hedge contracts pertain to the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso and the Chinese yuan. The gross
U.S. dollar equivalent notional amount of all foreign currency derivative hedges outstanding at September 30, 2016 was $212.2 million, representing a net settlement liability of $2.6 million. Based on foreign exchange rates as of
September 30, 2016, we estimate that $2.4 million of net foreign currency derivative losses included in other comprehensive income as of September 30, 2016 will be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve months.  
 The fair values of derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 were:

  Financial Instruments (Continued)         
  The effects of derivative financial instruments on the statements of
comprehensive income for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were:      
   The effective portion of cash flow hedges recognized in other comprehensive income were net
(losses) gains of $(8.0) million and $4.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effective portion of cash flow hedges recognized in other comprehensive income were net (losses) gains of zero and
$2.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges recognized in other (income) expense, net, was
insignificant.

  Fair Value Measurements       ASC requirements for Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosures establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels. Level 1 inputs, the highest priority, are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities. Level 2 inputs reflect inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are either observable directly or through corroboration with observable market data. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs, due to little or no market
activity for the asset or liability, such as internally-developed valuation models.

  The carrying value, net of underwriting commissions, price discounts and debt

   The estimated fair value of our Senior notes and term loan is determined primarily using
broker quotes, which are level 2 inputs.    Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were as follows:      
   During the second quarter of 2016, we entered into a joint venture arrangement with a partner
to operate a manufacturing facility in China. Under the arrangement, we are required to make certain fixed payments to our partner each year starting in June 2017 and through June 2024 (final year of the agreement) and also purchase the outstanding
preferred shares of our partner in 2024. During the second quarter of 2016, we recognized the fair value of $8.2 million of these contractual payments, including a redemption of the preferred shares ($7.2 million within other non-current liabilities
and $1.0 million due within one year in other current liabilities). We have also recognized the excess of $5.2 million of this liability fair value over the $3.0 million cash contributed by our partner within paid-in capital.

  Defined Benefit Plans       The components of net periodic benefit cost for
pension and postretirement benefits for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:      
     
   In the first quarter of 2013, the Company communicated a plan amendment to reduce health
benefits to certain retired employees. Due to the risk of litigation at the time of the initial communication, the Company elected to defer the full recognition of the benefit arising from the plan amendment. Following a favorable court decision in
the first quarter of 2016, the Company determined that it was now probable that it would realize the benefit from the plan amendment. As a result, the Company performed a re-measurement of the affected retiree plan liability as of March 31,
2016. This remeasurement resulted in a $10.7 million reduction of accrued retiree benefit plan liabilities and a corresponding increase in prior service credits. These prior service credits will be amortized over the next eight months after
September 30, 2016. In addition, we recorded a $0.9 million actuarial loss during the first quarter of 2016.    In
the third quarter of 2015, we recognized actuarial losses of $6.1 million related to the sale of the Waterloo tool storage business in discontinued operations in addition to the $2.8 million of actuarial losses reflected above.

The effective income tax rates for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 28.2% and 34.0%, respectively. In 2016, the effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by a tax benefit related to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, the new accounting guidance relating to share-based
compensation. The effective income tax rate for 2015 was unfavorably impacted by the tax cost related to the final settlement of a federal income tax audit covering the 2010 and nine months ended September 30, 2011 tax years, non-deductible
acquisition costs associated with the Norcraft acquisition, and restructuring charges for which the Company could not recognize a tax benefit. In addition, the effective income tax rates in 2016 and 2015 were favorably impacted by the tax benefit
attributable to the Domestic Production Activity (Internal Revenue Code Section 199) Deduction, favorable tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, and a benefit associated with the U.S. research and development credit, offset by state and local
taxes and increases to uncertain tax positions.    The effective income tax rates for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 28.6% and 32.8%, respectively. In 2016, the effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by a tax benefit related to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, the new accounting guidance relating to share-based
compensation. In addition, the effective income tax rates in 2016 and 2015 were favorably impacted by the tax benefit attributable to the Domestic Production Activity (Internal Revenue Code Section 199) Deduction, favorable tax rates in foreign
jurisdictions, and a benefit associated with the U.S. research and development credit, offset by state and local taxes and increases to uncertain tax positions.  
 It is reasonably possible that, within the next 12 months, total unrecognized tax benefits may decrease in the range of $1
million to $5 million, primarily as a result of the conclusion of pending U.S. federal, state and foreign income tax proceedings.      
   We generally record warranty expense at the time of
sale. We offer our customers various warranty terms based on the type of product that is sold. Warranty expense is determined based on historic claim experience and the nature of the product category. The following table summarizes activity related
to our product warranty liability for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Litigation   
 We are defendants in lawsuits associated with the normal conduct of our businesses and operations. It is not possible to

will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, and where appropriate, these actions are being vigorously contested.  
  Environmental   
 Compliance with federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating
to the protection of the environment, did not have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of Fortune Brands during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. We are involved in remediation
activities to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws. Liabilities for remediation costs of each site are based on our best estimate of undiscounted future costs, excluding possible insurance recoveries or recoveries from
other third parties. We believe compliance with current environmental protection laws (before taking into account estimated recoveries from third parties) will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, cash flows or
financial condition. Uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, technology and information related to individual sites make it difficult to develop estimates of environmental remediation exposures.

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in
conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which are included in this report, as well as our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, which are
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.    This discussion contains forward-looking statements
that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), regarding business strategies, market
potential, future financial performance, pension contributions, impact of acquisitions and other matters. Statements preceded by, followed by or that otherwise include the words  believes,   expects,   anticipates, 
 intends,   projects,   estimates,   plans  and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as  will,   should,   would,   may  and  could  are
generally forward-looking in nature and not historical facts. Where, in any forward-looking statement, we express an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief based on current expectations, estimates,
assumptions and projections about our industry, business and future financial results, based on information available at the time this report is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or with respect to any document incorporated by
reference, available as of the time such document was prepared. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including but not limited to: (i) our
reliance on the North American home improvement, repair and new home construction activity levels, (ii) the North American and global economies, (iii) risk associated with entering into potential strategic acquisitions and integrating
acquired property, (iv) our ability to remain competitive, innovative and protect our intellectual property, (v) our reliance on key customers and suppliers, (vi) the cost and availability associated with our supply chains and the
availability of raw materials, (vii) risk of increases in our defined benefit-related costs and funding requirements, (viii) compliance with tax, environmental and federal, state and international laws and industry regulatory standards and
(ix) the risk of doing business internationally. These and other factors are discussed in Part I, Item 1A  Risk Factors  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. We undertake no obligation
to, and expressly disclaim any such obligation to, update or clarify any forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events, new information or changes to future results over time or
otherwise, except as required by law.      OVERVIEW    
 References to  Fortune Brands,   the Company,   we,   our  and  us  refer to Fortune Brands
Home   Security, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries as a whole, unless the context otherwise requires. The Company is a leader in home and security products focused on the design, manufacture and sale of market-leading branded products
in the following categories: kitchen and bath cabinetry, plumbing and accessories, entry door systems and security products.  
      30  

OVERVIEW (Continued)    
   
  We believe the Company has certain competitive advantages including market-leading brands, a
diversified mix of channels, and lean and flexible supply chains, as well as a tradition of strong innovation and customer service. We are focused on outperforming our markets in growth, profitability and returns in order to drive increased
shareholder value. We believe the Company s track record reflects the long-term attractiveness and potential of our categories and our leading brands. As consumer demand and the housing market grow, we expect the benefits of operating leverage
and strategic spending will help us continue to achieve profitable organic growth.    We believe our most attractive opportunities are to
invest in profitable organic growth initiatives. We also believe that as the market recovers, we have the potential to generate additional growth from leveraging our cash flow and balance sheet strength by pursuing accretive strategic acquisitions
and joint ventures, and returning cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and common stock repurchases under our share repurchase programs as explained in further detail under  Liquidity and Capital Resources  below.  
 The U.S. market for our home products consists of spending on both new home construction and repair and remodel activities within existing
homes, with the substantial majority of the markets we serve consisting of repair and remodel spending. We believe that the U.S. market for our home products is in the midst of a multi-year recovery from the U.S. economic recession that ended in
mid-2009 and that a continued recovery will largely depend on consumer confidence, employment, home prices, stable mortgage rates and credit availability. Over the long term, we believe that the U.S. home products market will benefit from favorable
population and immigration trends, which will drive demand for new housing units, and from aging existing housing stock that will continue to need to be repaired and remodeled.  
 We may be impacted by fluctuations in raw material and transportation costs, changes in foreign exchange, and promotional activity among our
competitors. We strive to offset the potential unfavorable impact of these items with productivity initiatives and price increases.  
 During the third quarter of 2016, we announced the creation of the Global Plumbing Group (GPG), which was designed to support the growth of
multiple plumbing brands, with an enhanced set of products and brands while leveraging Moen s existing global supply chain and broad distribution network.  
 In September 2016, we acquired ROHL, a California-based luxury plumbing company. In a related transaction, we also acquired TCL Manufacturing
Ltd, which gave us 100% ownership of Perrin   Rowe, a UK manufacturer and designer of luxury kitchen and bathroom plumbing products. The total combined purchase price was approximately $166 million, subject to certain post-closing
adjustments. We financed both acquisitions using cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facilities. These transactions broadened the plumbing portfolio and enhanced future growth opportunities.  
 In May 2016, we acquired Riobel, a Canadian plumbing company specializing in premium showroom bath and shower fittings, for a total purchase
price of $88.4 million in cash, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. We financed the transaction using cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facilities.  
      31  

OVERVIEW (Continued)    
   
  In June 2016, we amended and restated our credit agreement to combine and rollover the
existing revolving credit facility and term loan into a new standalone $1.25 billion revolving credit facility. Terms and conditions of the credit agreement, including the total commitment amount, essentially remained the same. The revolving credit
facility matures in June 2021 and borrowings thereunder will be used for general corporate purposes.    In September 2015, we completed the
sale of Waterloo Industries, Inc. ( Waterloo ) for approximately $14 million in cash, subject to certain post-closing adjustments.  
 In June 2015, we issued $900 million of unsecured senior notes ( Senior Notes ) in a registered public offering. We used the
proceeds from the Senior Notes offering to pay down our revolving credit facility and for general purposes.    In May 2015, we acquired
Norcraft Companies, Inc. ( Norcraft ), a leading publicly-owned manufacturer of kitchen and bathroom cabinetry, for a total purchase price of $648.6 million. We financed the transaction using cash on hand and borrowings under our existing
credit facilities. This acquisition is expected to strengthen our overall product offering, round out our regional market penetration and enhance our frameless cabinetry capabilities.  
 In March 2015, we acquired a Cabinets component company for approximately $6 million in cash. This acquisition did not have a material impact
on our financial statements.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    
   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared To Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
   
   The following discussion of consolidated results of operations and segment results refers to the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Consolidated results of operations should be read in conjunction with segment results of operations.  
  Net sales     Net sales increased $328.6
million, or 10%. The increase was due to the benefits of the acquisitions in our Cabinets and Plumbing segments, higher sales volume primarily from the continuing improvement in U.S. market conditions for home products, price increases to help
mitigate cumulative raw material cost increases and favorable mix. These benefits were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $23 million.  
  Cost of products sold     Cost of products
sold increased $159.9 million, or 7%, due to higher net sales including the impact of the acquisitions in our Cabinets and Plumbing segments, partially offset by the benefit of productivity improvements.  
  Selling, general and administrative expenses   
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $53.3 million, or 7%, primarily due to the impact of the acquisitions in our Cabinets
and Plumbing segments and higher employee-related costs, partially offset by the absence of Norcraft transaction costs in 2016 ($15.1 million in 2015).  
      33  

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)    
   
   Amortization of intangible assets   
 Amortization of intangible assets increased $5.1 million due to the recognition of certain intangible assets from the acquisition of Norcraft
and acquisitions in the Plumbing segment.     Restructuring charges   
 Restructuring charges of $12.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily related to severance costs and charges
associated with the relocation of a manufacturing facility within our Security segment. Restructuring charges in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were $12.6 million.  
  Operating income     Operating income
increased $110.5 million, or 31% primarily due to higher net sales, productivity improvements and favorable mix. These benefits were partially offset by higher employee-related costs, higher sales rebates and advertising costs. Operating income
in 2015 was also impacted by $15.1 million of Norcraft transaction costs, which did not recur in 2016.     Interest expense   
 Interest expense increased $17.0 million to $37.5 million due to higher average borrowings and higher average interest rates.  
  Other (income) expense, net     Other
(income) expense, net, was income of $0.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to expense of $3.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The change was due to favorable foreign currency adjustments.
    Income taxes     The effective income
tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 28.2% and 34.0%, respectively. In 2016, the effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by a tax benefit related to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, the new accounting
guidance relating to share-based compensation. The effective income tax rate for 2015 was unfavorably impacted by the tax cost related to the final settlement of a federal income tax audit covering the 2010 and nine months ended September 30,
2011 tax years, non-deductible acquisition costs associated with the Norcraft acquisition, and restructuring charges for which the Company could not recognize a tax benefit. In addition, the effective income tax rates in 2016 and 2015 were favorably
impacted by the tax benefit attributable to the Domestic Production Activity (Internal Revenue Code Section 199) Deduction, favorable tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, and a benefit associated with the U.S. research and development credit,
offset by state and local taxes and increases to uncertain tax positions.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)    
   
   Net income from continuing operations   
 Net income from continuing operations was $308.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $218.9 million in the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase of $89.1 million was due to higher operating income partially offset by higher interest expense and higher income taxes.  
  Income from discontinued operations   
 Income from discontinued operations was $1.5 million and $8.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes the effect of tax adjustments relating to the Waterloo business. The discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 consist of the
results of operations of Waterloo and the gain associated with the sale of the business.     Results By Segment   
  Cabinets     Net sales increased $231.9
million, or 15%, due to the benefit of the Norcraft acquisition, the benefit of price increases to help mitigate cumulative raw material cost increases, favorable mix and higher sales volume including the impact of new product introductions. These
benefits were partially offset by approximately $6 million of unfavorable foreign exchange.    Operating income increased $61.9 million, or
47%, due to higher net sales, productivity improvements and favorable mix. These benefits were partially offset by higher employee-related costs.  
  Plumbing     Net sales increased $52
million, or 5%, due to higher sales volume in the U.S. driven by improving U.S. market conditions and new product introductions, price increases to help mitigate cumulative raw material cost increases and the benefits of the acquisitions of Riobel,
ROHL and TCL Manufacturing Ltd. These benefits were partially offset by unfavorable mix, unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $14 million and higher sales rebates.  
 Operating income increased $28.0 million, or 13%, due to higher net sales as well as the benefits of productivity improvements. These benefits
were partially offset by higher employee-related costs and unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $7 million. Operating income in 2016 was also favorably impacted by lower restructuring and other charges ($4.9 million impact). These charges
primarily related to severance costs to relocate a facility in China.  
      35  

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)    

Results By Segment (Continued)   
   
   Doors   
 Net sales increased $26.7 million, or 8%, due to higher sales volume driven primarily by improved conditions in the U.S. home products market,
favorable mix and price increases to help mitigate cumulative raw material cost increases.    Operating income increased $15.4 million, or
50%, due to higher net sales, the benefits of productivity improvements and approximately $2 million of favorable foreign exchange. These benefits were partially offset by higher employee-related costs.  
  Security     Net sales increased $18.0
million, or 4%, due to higher sales volume in the U.S. and Europe and price increases to help mitigate cumulative raw material cost increases. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of exiting certain product lines and unfavorable
foreign exchange of approximately $2 million.    Operating income increased $1.6 million, or 4% due to higher net sales as well as the
benefits of productivity improvements. These benefits were partially offset by $5.5 million of higher restructuring and other charges primarily associated with the relocation of a manufacturing facility, and unfavorable foreign exchange of
approximately $2 million.  
      36  

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)    

Results By Segment (Continued)   
   
   Corporate   
 Corporate expenses decreased $3.6 million predominantly due to the absence in 2016 of $15.1 million of transaction costs associated with the
Norcraft acquisition, partially offset by higher employee-related costs and lower defined benefit plan income.      

(a)    
  Represents external costs directly related to the acquisition of Norcraft and primarily includes expenditures for banking, legal, accounting and other similar services.     
 In future periods the Company may record, in the Corporate segment, material expense or income associated with actuarial gains and losses
arising from periodic remeasurement of our liabilities for defined benefit plans. At a minimum the Company will remeasure its defined benefit plan liabilities in the fourth quarter of each year. Remeasurements due to plan amendments and settlements
may also occur in interim periods during the year. Remeasurement of these liabilities attributable to updating our liability discount rates and expected return on assets may, in particular, result in material income or expense recognition.  
 Based on current relevant interest rate benchmarks and year-to-date pension asset returns, the Company may incur additional defined benefit
plan actuarial losses in the range of $0.15 to $0.25 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016 due to declining discount rates since December 31, 2015, the last remeasurement date. Any actuarial loss incurred in the fourth quarter will be
based upon spot discount rates as of December 31, 2016 and our full year 2016 pension asset returns and may differ materially from this estimate. A 25 basis point change in our discount rate impacts our defined benefit plan liabilities by
approximately $25 million.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)    
   
    Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared To Three Months Ended September 30, 2015
       
   The following discussion of consolidated results of operations and segment results refers to the three months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. Consolidated results of operations should be read in conjunction with segment results of operations.  
  Net sales     Net sales increased $40.2
million, or 3%. The increase was due to the price increases to help mitigate cumulative raw material cost increases, higher sales volume primarily from the continuing improvement in U.S. market conditions for home products and the benefits of the
acquisitions in our Plumbing segment. These benefits were partially offset by unfavorable impact of foreign exchange (approximately $5 million).     Cost
of products sold     Cost of products sold decreased $3.3 million. The impact of higher net sales was more than offset by lower commodity
costs, productivity improvements and favorable mix.     Selling, general and administrative expenses   
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $18.8 million, or 7%, due to higher employee-related costs and higher advertising costs.
 
      38  

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)    
   
   Amortization of intangible assets   
 Amortization of intangible assets increased $0.6 million due to the acquisitions in the Plumbing segment.  
  Restructuring charges     Restructuring
charges of $3.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily related to the relocation of a manufacturing facility within our Security segment. Restructuring charges in the three months ended September 30, 2015 were $1.8
million.     Operating income     Operating
income increased $22.8 million, or 14% primarily due to higher net sales and productivity improvements. These benefits were partially offset by higher employee-related costs and higher advertising costs.  
  Interest expense     Interest expense
increased $0.7 million to $11.8 million due to higher average borrowings partially offset by lower average interest rates.     Other (income) expense, net
    Other (income) expense, net was $0.6 million expense in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to expense of $0.5
million in the three months ended September 30, 2015.     Income taxes   
 The effective income tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 28.6% and 32.8%, respectively. In 2016, the
effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by a tax benefit related to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, the new accounting guidance relating to share-based compensation. In addition, the effective income tax rates in 2016 and 2015 were favorably
impacted by the tax benefit attributable to the Domestic Production Activity (Internal Revenue Code Section 199) Deduction, favorable tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, and a benefit associated with the U.S. research and development credit,
offset by state and local taxes and increases to uncertain tax positions.     Net income from continuing operations   
 Net income from continuing operations was $121.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $100.0 million in the
three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase of $21.9 million was due to a higher operating income, partially offset by higher interest expense.  
      39  

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)    
   
   Income from discontinued operations   
 Income from discontinued operations was $1.5 million and $7.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The discontinued operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 includes the effect of tax adjustments relating to the Waterloo business. The discontinued operations for the three months ended September 30, 2015 consisted of the
results of operations of Waterloo and the gain associated with the sale of the business.     Results By Segment   
  Cabinets     Net sales were essentially flat
due to the benefit of price increases to help mitigate cumulative raw material cost increases and favorable mix which were offset by a load-in of new products into our retail distribution channel in 2015 that did not repeat in 2016.  
 Operating income increased $10.6 million, or 17%, due to the benefit of price increases to help mitigate cumulative raw material cost
increases and productivity improvements. These benefits were partially offset by costs associated with investments to support manufacturing capacity increases for long-term growth.  
  Plumbing     Net sales increased $26.7
million, or 7%, due to higher sales volume in the U.S. driven by improving market conditions and new product introductions, the benefits of the acquisitions of Riobel, ROHL and TCL Manufacturing Ltd and price increases to help mitigate cumulative
raw material cost increases, and higher international sales. These benefits were partially offset by higher sales rebates and foreign exchange of approximately $4 million.  
 Operating income increased $3.1 million, or 4%, due to higher net sales and productivity improvements. These benefits were partially offset by
higher advertising costs of $6 million and unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $2 million.     Doors   
 Net sales increased $5.4 million, or 4%, due to higher sales volume driven primarily by improved conditions in the U.S. home products market
and price increases to help mitigate cumulative raw material cost increases.    Operating income increased $5.6 million, or 34%, due to
higher net sales as well as the benefits of productivity improvements.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   
 Our primary liquidity needs are to support working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures and service indebtedness, as well as to
finance acquisitions, repurchase shares of our common stock and pay dividends to stockholders, as deemed appropriate. Our principal sources of liquidity have been cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities, availability under our credit
facilities and debt issuances in capital markets. Our operating income is generated by our subsidiaries. There are no legal restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to Fortune Brands. In December
2015, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 14% to $0.16 per share of our outstanding common stock. Our Board of Directors will continue to evaluate dividend payment opportunities on a quarterly basis. There can be no
assurance as to when and if future dividends will be paid, and at what level, because the payment of dividends is dependent on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our
Board of Directors.    In June 2016, the Company amended and restated its credit agreement to combine and rollover the existing revolving
credit facility and term loan into a new standalone $1.25 billion revolving credit facility. This amendment of the credit agreement was a non-cash transaction for the Company. Terms and conditions of the credit agreement, including the total
commitment amount, essentially remained the same. The revolving credit facility matures in June 2021 and borrowings thereunder will be used for general corporate purposes. On September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our outstanding
borrowings under these facilities, net of debt issuance costs relating to the term loan balance, were $695.0 million and $279.0 million, respectively. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the current portion of long-term debt was
zero. Interest rates under the facility are variable based on LIBOR at the time of the borrowing and the Company s long-term credit rating and can range from LIBOR + 0.9% to LIBOR + 1.5%. As of September 30, 2016, we were in
compliance with all covenants under this facility. As a result of the refinancing, we wrote-off prepaid debt issuance costs of approximately $1.3 million as of June 30, 2016. We retrospectively adopted ASU 2015-03,  Simplifying the
Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,  on January 1, 2016, resulting in the reclassification of approximately $3 million of debt issuance costs from other current assets and other assets to long-term debt as of December 31, 2015.
Adoption of this guidance did not impact the Company s equity, results of operations or cash flows.    In the first nine months of
2016, we repurchased 7.6 million shares of our outstanding common stock under the Company s share repurchase program for $362.7 million. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s total remaining share repurchase authorization under
the Company s repurchase program was approximately $285 million. The share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.  
 Acquisitions and divestitures in 2016 and 2015 included:      

In September 2016, we acquired ROHL, a California-based luxury plumbing company. In a related transaction, we also acquired TCL Manufacturing Ltd, which gave us 100% ownership of Perrin   Rowe, a UK
manufacturer and designer of luxury kitchen and bathroom plumbing products. The total combined purchase price was approximately $166 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. We financed the transaction using cash on hand and borrowings
under our existing credit facilities.        

In May 2016, we acquired Riobel, a Canadian plumbing company for a purchase price of approximately $88 million in cash, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. We financed the transaction using cash on hand and
borrowings under our existing credit facilities.        

In September 2015, we completed the sale of the Waterloo tool storage business for approximately $14 million in cash, subject to certain post-closing adjustments.    

In May 2015, we acquired Norcraft, a leading manufacturer of kitchen and bathroom cabinetry, for a purchase price of $648.6 million. We financed this transaction using cash on hand and borrowings under our existing
credit facilities.    
      42  

We periodically review our portfolio of brands and evaluate potential strategic transactions and
other capital initiatives to increase shareholder value. However, we cannot predict whether or when we may enter into acquisitions, joint ventures or dispositions, make any purchases of shares of our common stock under our share repurchase programs,
or pay dividends, or what impact any such transactions could have on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, whether as a result of the issuance of debt or equity securities, or otherwise. Our cash flows from operations,
borrowing availability and overall liquidity are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including those described in the section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2015 entitled  Item 1A. Risk
Factors.     In June 2015, we issued $900 million of Senior Notes in a registered public offering. The Senior Notes consist of two
tranches: $400 million of five-year notes due 2020 with a coupon of 3% and $500 million of ten-year notes due 2025 with a coupon of 4%. We used the proceeds from the Senior Notes offering to pay down our revolving credit facility and for general
purposes. On September 30, 2016, the outstanding amount of the Senior Notes, net of underwriting commissions and price discounts, was $890.8 million.  
 On September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $278.6 million, of which $251.3 million was held at non-U.S. subsidiaries. We
manage our global cash requirements considering (i) available funds among the subsidiaries through which we conduct business, (ii) the geographic location of our liquidity needs, and (iii) the cost to access international cash
balances. The undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are considered indefinitely reinvested. If these funds were needed for our operations in the U.S., the repatriation of non-U.S. cash balances from certain subsidiaries could have adverse
tax consequences as we may be required to pay and record income tax expense on those funds to the extent they were previously considered indefinitely reinvested.  
 Our operating cash flows are significantly impacted by the seasonality of our business. We typically generate most our operating cash flow in
the third and fourth quarters of each year. We use operating cash in the first half of the year, particularly in the first quarter.  
      43  

Cash Flows    
 Below is a summary of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
   
   Net cash provided by operating activities was $380.6 million in the nine months ended September 30,
2016 compared to $277.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in cash provided of $102.8 million was primarily due to higher net income and a lower build in working capital in 2016 compared to 2015. These benefits
were partially offset by higher incentive compensation and customer program payments in the first quarter of 2016 compared to 2015.    Net
cash used in investing activities was $334.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $725.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease of $390.7 million was primarily due to the decrease in
cost of acquisitions of $422.3 million, partially offset by $19 million of higher capital spending.    Net cash used in financing activities
was $9.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $616.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in cash provided of $626.3 million was
primarily due to higher share repurchases in 2016 compared to 2015 ($347.0 million) and lower net borrowings of $254.9 million.    The cash
flows related to discontinued operations are combined with cash flows from continuing operations within each category on the statements of cash flows.  
   Pension Plans      In 2016, we expect
to make pension contributions of approximately $1 million. For the foreseeable future, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet the minimum funding that may be required by the Pension Protection Act of 2006.  
   Foreign Exchange      We have
investments in various foreign countries, principally Canada, Mexico, China and France. Therefore, changes in the value of the related currencies affect our financial statements when translated into U.S. dollars.  
      44  

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS    
  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   
 In September 2016 the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15 that
will change how an entity classifies certain cash receipts and cash payments on its statement of cash flows. The key changes that may potentially impact our financial statements include the following: 1) Cash payments for debt prepayment or
extinguishment costs should be classified as financing cash outflows; 2) Contingent consideration payments that are not made within three months after the consummation of a business combination would be classified as financing (if payment made is up
to the acquisition date fair value of liability) or operating outflows (if in excess of acquisition fair value). Cash payments made  soon after  the consummation of a business combination generally will be classified as cash outflows for
investing activities; 3) Insurance settlement proceeds, would be classified based on the nature of the loss; and 4) Company-owned life insurance settlement proceeds would be presented as investing cash inflows, and premiums could be classified as
investing or operating cash outflows, or a combination of both. The new standard is effective beginning January 1, 2018 and should be adopted retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are assessing the impact the adoption of this
standard will have on our financial statements.     Financial Instruments Credit Losses   
 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 that changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are
not measured at fair value through net income. The new guidance applies to most financial assets measured at amortized cost, including trade and other receivables and loans as well as off-balance-sheet credit exposures (e.g., loan commitments,
standby letters of credit). The standard will replace the  incurred loss  approach under the current guidance with an  expected loss  model that requires an entity to estimate its lifetime  expected credit loss . The
new standard is effective beginning January 1, 2020 and early application is permitted but not earlier than January 1, 2019. We are assessing the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements.  
      45  

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (Continued)    
   
   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09 that requires entities to recognize the income tax effects of share-based awards in the income
statement when the awards vest or are settled. The new standard also allows entities to withhold an amount up to an employee s maximum individual tax rate in the relevant jurisdiction without resulting in liability classification of the award.
The new standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2017. We early adopted this standard as of June 30, 2016.  
 We have reclassified $9.8 million and $13.8 million of employee withholding taxes paid from operating into financing activities in the
statement of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively, as required by ASU 2016-09 (adopted retrospectively).  
  Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting   
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07, which eliminates the requirement to apply the equity method of accounting retrospectively when an
entity obtains significant influence over a previously held investment. Previously, entities were required to retrospectively apply the equity method of accounting when obtaining significant influence over an investment (for example due to an
increase in ownership). The new standard is effective beginning January 1, 2017. Earlier application is permitted, however we elected not to early adopt. We do not expect this standard to have a material effect on our financial statements.  
  Leases     In February 2016, the FASB issued
ASU 2016-02,  Leases  that requires lessees to recognize almost all leases on their balance sheet as a  right-of-use  asset and lease liability but recognize related expenses in a manner similar to current accounting. The
guidance also eliminates current real estate-specific provisions for all entities. The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 (calendar year 2019 for Fortune Brands) and earlier application is permitted.
We are assessing the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements.  
      46  

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (Concluded)    
   
   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   
 In January 2016, the FASB issued final guidance ASU 2016-01 that requires entities to measure investments in unconsolidated entities (other
than those accounted for using the equity method of accounting) at fair value through the income statement. There will no longer be an available-for-sale classification (with changes in fair value reported in Other Comprehensive Income). In
addition, the cost method is eliminated for equity investments without readily determinable fair values. The new standard is effective beginning January 1, 2018. Earlier application is permitted for certain provisions of the standard, however
we elected not to early adopt. We do not expect this standard to have a material effect on our financial statements.     Simplifying Subsequent
Measurement of Inventory     In July 2015, the FASB issued a final standard that simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventory by
replacing the current standard of lower of cost or market test. Under the current guidance the subsequent measurement of inventory is measured at the lower of cost or market, where  market  may have multiple possible outcomes. The new
guidance requires subsequent measurement of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs to sell (completion,
disposal, and transportation). This new standard is effective for the annual period beginning January 1, 2017. Earlier application is permitted, however we elected not to early adopt. We do not expect this standard to have a material effect on
our financial statements.     Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern   
 In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going
Concern.  This ASU provides guidance about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. This amendment
is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016 (calendar year 2017 for Fortune Brands), and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted, however we elected not to early adopt. We do not
expect this standard to have a material effect on our financial statements.     Revenue from Contracts with Customers   
 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  This ASU clarifies the accounting for revenue
arising from contracts with customers and specifies the disclosures that an entity should include in its financial statements. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (calendar year 2018 for
Fortune Brands). During the first half of 2016, the FASB issued the final amendments to the standard relating to the principal versus agent guidance, accounting for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance obligations as well as
the guidance on transition, collectability, noncash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes. The effective date and transition requirements for these amendments are the same as those of the new revenue standard. We expect
to complete our assessment of the impact of adoption in the second quarter of 2017 and finalize the adoption process of the new revenue standard by the end of 2017.  
      47  

Item 3.   
     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.        There have
been no material changes in the information provided in the section entitled  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Item 4.   
   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.          

(a)  
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.       The Company s management has
evaluated, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of
the period covered by this report.      

(b)  
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.       There have not been any changes
in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. The Company is in the process of reviewing the internal control structure of acquired businesses and, if necessary, will make appropriate changes as we incorporate our controls and procedures into those
recently acquired businesses.  
      48  

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION       

Item 1.   
   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.          

(a)  
  Other Litigation.       The Company is a defendant in lawsuits associated with the normal
conduct of its businesses and operations. It is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending actions, and, as with any litigation, it is possible that these actions could be decided unfavorably to the Company. The Company believes that there
are meritorious defenses to these actions and that these actions will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, and, where appropriate, these actions are being vigorously
contested.      

(b)  
  Environmental Matters.       Compliance with federal, state and local laws regulating the
discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, did not have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of Fortune Brands during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. We are involved in remediation activities to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws. Liabilities for remediation costs of each site are based on our best estimate of undiscounted future
costs, excluding possible insurance recoveries or recoveries from other third parties. We believe compliance with current environmental protection laws (before taking into account estimated recoveries from third parties) will not have a material
adverse effect upon our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, technology and information related to individual sites make it difficult to develop estimates of environmental
remediation exposures.      

Item 1A.   
   RISK FACTORS.        There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously
disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 in the section entitled  Risk Factors.       

Item 2.   
   UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.        Below are the
repurchases of common stock by the Company or any  affiliated purchaser  (as defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Exchange Act) for the three months ended September 30, 2016:
