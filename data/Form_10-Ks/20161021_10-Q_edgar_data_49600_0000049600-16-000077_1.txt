EASTGROUP PROPERTIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

(1) 
    BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
       
  The accompanying unaudited financial statements of EastGroup Properties, Inc. ( EastGroup  or  the Company ) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  In management s opinion, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  The financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements contained in the   2015   annual report on Form 10-K and the notes thereto.  Certain reclassifications have been made in the 2015 consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2016 presentation. 

(2) 
    PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION 
       
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of EastGroup Properties, Inc., its wholly owned subsidiaries and its investment in any joint ventures in which the Company has a controlling interest.  At   December 31, 2015   and September 30, 2016, the Company had a controlling interest in   two   joint ventures: the   80%   owned University Business Center and the   80%   owned Castilian Research Center.  During the second quarter of 2016, Castilian Research Center was sold, and the joint venture is in the process of being terminated.  The Company records   100%   of the joint ventures  assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses with noncontrolling interests provided for in accordance with the joint venture agreements.  The equity method of accounting is used for the Company s   50%   undivided tenant-in-common interest in Industry Distribution Center II.  All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. 

(3) 
    USE OF ESTIMATES 
       
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses during the reporting period and to disclose material contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

(4) 
    REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES 
       
  EastGroup has one reportable segment   industrial properties.  These properties are concentrated in major Sunbelt markets of the United States, primarily in the states of Florida, Texas, Arizona, California and North Carolina, have similar economic characteristics and also meet the other criteria permitting the properties to be aggregated into one reportable segment. 
    
  The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows (including estimated future expenditures necessary to substantially complete the asset) expected to be generated by the asset.  If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company determined that no impairment charges on the Company s real estate properties were necessary. 
    
  Depreciation of buildings and other improvements is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of generally   40   years for buildings and   3   to   15   years for improvements.  Building improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repair expenses are charged to expense as incurred.  Significant renovations and improvements that improve or extend the useful life of the assets are capitalized.  Depreciation expense was $  15,855,000   and   $47,273,000   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $14,945,000   and   $44,503,000   for the same periods in 2015.

    EASTGROUP PROPERTIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

The Company s   Real estate properties   and   Development   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows: 

(5) 
    DEVELOPMENT 
       
  During the period in which a property is under development, costs associated with development (i.e., land, construction costs, interest expense, property taxes and other direct and indirect costs associated with development) are aggregated into the total capitalized costs of the property.  Included in these costs are management s estimates for the portions of internal costs (primarily personnel costs) deemed  related to such development activities.  The internal costs are allocated to specific development properties based on development activity.  As the property becomes occupied, depreciation commences on the occupied portion of the building, and costs are capitalized only for the portion of the building that remains vacant.  When the property becomes   80%   occupied or   one   year after completion of the shell construction (whichever comes first), capitalization of development costs, including interest expense, property taxes and internal personnel costs, ceases.  The properties are then transferred to   Real estate properties  , and depreciation commences on the entire property (excluding the land). 

(6) 
    BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES 
       
  Upon acquisition of real estate properties, the Company applies the principles of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805,   Business Combinations  , which requires that acquisition-related costs be recognized as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received.  The Codification also provides guidance on how to properly determine the allocation of the purchase price among the individual components of both the tangible and intangible assets based on their respective fair values.  Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired.  Factors considered by management in allocating the cost of the properties acquired include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases.  The allocation to tangible assets (land, building and improvements) is based upon management's determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models.  The Company determines whether any financing assumed is above or below market based upon comparison to similar financing terms for similar properties.  The cost of the properties acquired may be adjusted based on indebtedness assumed from the seller that is determined to be above or below market rates.   
    
  The purchase price is also allocated among the following categories of intangible assets:  the above or below market component of in-place leases, the value of in-place leases, and the value of customer relationships.  The value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in-place lease is determined based upon the present value (using a discount rate reflecting the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term, and (ii) management s estimate of the amounts that would be paid using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease.  The amounts allocated to above and below market leases are included in   Other assets   and   Other liabilities  , respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases.  The total amount of intangible assets is further allocated to in-place lease values and customer relationship values based upon management s assessment of their respective values.  These intangible assets are included in   Other assets   on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease or the anticipated life of the customer relationship, as applicable. 
    
  Amortization expense for in-place lease intangibles was $  1,056,000   and   $3,202,000   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $944,000   and   $3,129,000   for the same periods of 2015.  Amortization of above and below market leases increased rental income by $  121,000   and   $370,000   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $94,000   and   $326,000   for the same periods of 2015.

    EASTGROUP PROPERTIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , EastGroup acquired Parc North, a   four  -building complex in Fort Worth (Dallas), Texas, for   $32 million  .  The buildings, which contain   446,000   square feet and are currently   42%   leased, were recently developed by the seller and are considered to be in the lease-up phase of development.  In addition, the Company acquired Flagler Center, a   three  -building,   358,000   square foot business distribution complex in Jacksonville, Florida, for   $24 million  . 
    
  The total cost for the properties acquired by the Company during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , was   $55,939,000  , of which   $22,228,000   was allocated to   Real estate properties   and   $30,984,000   was allocated to   Development  .  EastGroup allocated   $11,932,000   of the total purchase price to land using third party land valuations for the Dallas and Jacksonville markets.  The market values are considered to be Level 3 inputs as defined by ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   (see Note 18 for additional information on ASC 820).  Intangibles associated with the purchase of real estate were allocated as follows:    $3,187,000   to in-place lease intangibles and   $342,000   to above market leases (both included in   Other assets   on the Consolidated Balance Sheets), and   $802,000   to below market leases (included in   Other liabilities   on the Consolidated Balance Sheets).      
    
  During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company acquired Southpark Corporate Center and Springdale Business Center, both in Austin, Texas, for a total cost of   $31,574,000  , of which   $28,648,000   was allocated to   Real estate properties.    EastGroup allocated   $5,494,000   of the total purchase price to land using third party land valuations for the Austin market.  Intangibles associated with the purchase of real estate were allocated as follows:    $3,453,000   to in-place lease intangibles (included in   Other assets   on the Consolidated Balance Sheets) and   $527,000   to below market leases (included in   Other liabilities   on the Consolidated Balance Sheets).   
    
  The intangible assets, including in-place lease intangibles, above market leases and below market leases, are amortized over the remaining lives of the associated leases in place at the time of acquisition.   
    
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , EastGroup expensed acquisition costs of   $161,000  .  The Company did not expense any acquisition-related costs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
    
  The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of goodwill (at least annually) and the recoverability of other intangibles (on a quarterly basis) for possible impairment.  In management s opinion, no impairment of goodwill or other intangibles existed at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

(7) 
    REAL ESTATE SOLD AND HELD FOR SALE/DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 
       
  The Company considers a real estate property to be held for sale when it meets the criteria established under ASC 360,   Property, Plant and Equipment,   including when it is probable that the property will be sold within a year.  Real estate properties held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell and are not depreciated while they are held for sale.   
    
  In accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-08,   Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360), Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity,   the Company would report a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results when the component or group of components meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale or when the component or group of components is disposed of by sale or other than by sale.  In addition, the Company would provide additional disclosures about both discontinued operations and the disposal of an individually significant component of an entity that does not qualify for discontinued operations presentation in the financial statements.  EastGroup performs an analysis of properties sold to determine whether the sales qualify for discontinued operations presentation.   
    
  The Company did not classify any properties as held for sale as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 
    
  The Company does not consider its sales in 2015 and the first nine months of 2016 to be disposals of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity representing a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the entity's operations and financial results.  
    
  During the first quarter of 2016, EastGroup sold the following operating properties in separate transactions: Northwest Point Distribution and Service Centers in Houston and North Stemmons III in Dallas.  The properties contain a combined   292,000   square feet and were sold for   $18,850,000  .  EastGroup recognized gains on the sales of   $11,332,000  .  Also during the first quarter of 2016, the Company sold a small parcel of land in Orlando for   $673,000   and recognized a gain of   $10,000  .

EASTGROUP PROPERTIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

Secured debt     decreased   $  89,375,000   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The   decrease   primarily resulted from  the repayment of   two   mortgage loans with a combined balance of   $75,737,000   and regularly scheduled principal payments of   $13,558,000  . 
    
  Properties encumbered by EastGroup's   Secured debt   were disclosed in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company closed collateral substitutions for two of its secured loans.  The first collateral substitution was for a loan previously secured by America Plaza, Central Green, Glenmont, West Loop, World Houston 3-9, Interstate I-III, Rojas, Stemmons Circle and Venture.  Colorado Crossing in Austin and Steele Creek 1   2 in Charlotte were substituted for America Plaza, Central Green, Glenmont and West Loop in Houston.   
    
  The second collateral substitution was for a loan previously secured by 40th Avenue, Beltway Crossing V, Centennial Park, Executive Airport, Ocean View, Techway Southwest IV, Wetmore 5-8 and World Houston 26, 28, 29 and 30.  Interchange Park I in Charlotte was substituted for Techway Southwest IV in Houston.  
    
  Unsecured debt     increased     $24,825,000   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to the closing of senior unsecured term loans totaling   $105 million  , partially offset by the repayment of an   $80 million   unsecured term loan.   
    
  The Company closed a   $65 million   senior unsecured term loan on April 1, 2016 with a   seven  -year term and interest only payments.  The loan bears interest at the annual rate of LIBOR plus an applicable margin (currently   1.65%  ) based on the Company's senior unsecured long-term debt rating.  The Company also entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert the loan's LIBOR rate component to a fixed interest rate for the entire term of the loan providing a total effective fixed interest rate of   2.863%  .   
    
  EastGroup closed a   $40 million   senior unsecured term loan on July 29, 2016 with a   five  -year term and interest only payments.  The loan bears interest at the annual rate of LIBOR plus an applicable margin (currently   1.10%  ) based on the Company's senior unsecured long-term debt rating.  The Company also entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert the loan's LIBOR rate component to a fixed interest rate for the entire term of the loan providing a total effective fixed interest rate of   2.335%  .  
    
  In August 2016, EastGroup repaid (with no penalty) an   $80 million   unsecured term loan with an effectively fixed interest rate of   2.770%   and an original maturity date of   August 15, 2018  .  On the same day, the Company borrowed   $80 million   through its   $300 million   unsecured bank credit facility; the maturity date for the credit facility is   July 30, 2019  .  The Company re-designated the interest rate swap that was previously applied to the   $80 million   unsecured term loan to the   $80 million   unsecured bank credit facility borrowing.  The   $80 million   unsecured bank credit facility draw has an effectively fixed interest rate of   2.020%   through the interest rate swap's maturity date of   August 15, 2018  . 
    
  Unsecured bank credit facilities     increased   $  56,037,000   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , mainly due to proceeds of   $444,314,000   (including the $80 million draw on August 15, 2016) exceeding repayments of   $388,569,000   during the period.  
    
  In connection with the adoption of ASU 2015-03, which is described in further detail in Note 17, the Company presents debt issuance costs as reductions of   Secured debt, Unsecured debt   and   Unsecured bank credit facilities   on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as detailed below.

The components of   Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)   are presented in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and are summarized below.  See Note 13 for information regarding the Company's interest rate swaps.

    DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 
       
  The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions.  The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities.  The Company manages economic risk, including interest rate, liquidity and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources and duration of its debt funding and, to a limited extent, the use of derivative instruments.   
    
  Specifically, the Company has entered into derivative instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates.  The Company's derivative instruments, described below, are used to manage differences in the amount, timing and duration of the Company's known or expected cash payments principally related to certain of the Company's borrowings.   
    
  The Company's objective in using interest rate derivatives is to change variable interest rates to fixed interest rates by using interest rate swaps.  Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.   
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   seven   interest rate swaps outstanding, all of which are used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with unsecured loans.  All of the Company's interest rate swaps convert the related loans' LIBOR rate components to effectively fixed interest rates, and the Company has concluded that each of the hedging relationships is highly effective.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges is recorded in   Other comprehensive income (loss)   and is subsequently reclassified into earnings through interest expense as interest payments are made in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.  The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives, which is immaterial for the periods reported, is recognized directly in earnings (included in   Other   on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income).   
    
  Amounts reported in   Other comprehensive income (loss)   related to derivatives will be reclassified to   Interest expense   as interest payments are made on the Company's variable-rate debt.  The Company estimates the swap interest payments will be   $3,534,000   over the next twelve months.  These payments approximate the expected cash interest payments for the swaps.  Since the interest payments on the swaps in combination with the associated debt have been effectively fixed, this estimate is not in addition to the Company's total expected combined interest payments or expense for the next twelve months. 
    
  The Company's valuation methodology for over-the-counter ( OTC ) derivatives is to discount cash flows based on Overnight Index Swap ( OIS ) rates.  Uncollateralized or partially-collateralized trades are discounted at OIS rates, but include appropriate economic adjustments for funding costs (i.e., a LIBOR-OIS basis adjustment to approximate uncollateralized cost of funds) and credit risk.  As of January 1, 2015, the Company began calculating its derivative valuations using mid-market prices; prior to that date, the Company used bid-market prices.  The change in valuation methodology is considered a change in accounting estimate and resulted from recent developments in the marketplace.  Management has assessed the impact of the change for all periods presented and has deemed the impact to be immaterial to the Company's financial statements. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had the following outstanding interest rate derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk:

The table below presents the effect of the Company's derivative financial instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015:   

See Note 12 for additional information on the Company's   Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)   resulting from its interest rate swaps. 
    
  Derivative financial agreements expose the Company to credit risk in the event of non-performance by the counterparties under the terms of the interest rate hedge agreements.  The Company believes it minimizes the credit risk by transacting with financial institutions the Company regards as credit-worthy.   
    
  The Company has an agreement with its derivative counterparties containing a provision stating that the Company could be declared in default on its derivative obligations if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had no derivatives in a net asset position; the fair value of derivatives in a net liability position related to the Company's derivative agreements was   $9,742,000  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has not posted any collateral related to these agreements.  If the Company had breached any of the contractual provisions of the derivative contracts, it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at their termination value of   $10,039,000  . 

The Company applies ASC 260,   Earnings Per Share  , which requires companies to present basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS).  Basic EPS represents the amount of earnings for the period attributable to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period.  The Company s basic EPS is calculated by dividing   Net Income Attributable to EastGroup Properties, Inc. Common Stockholders   by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  The weighted average number of common shares outstanding does not include any potentially dilutive securities or any unvested restricted shares of common stock.  These unvested restricted shares, although classified as issued and outstanding, are considered forfeitable until the restrictions lapse and will not be included in the basic EPS calculation until the shares are vested. 
    
  Diluted EPS represents the amount of earnings for the period attributable to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period and to each share that would have been outstanding assuming the issuance of common shares for all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the reporting period.  The Company calculates diluted EPS by dividing   Net Income Attributable to EastGroup Properties, Inc. Common Stockholders   by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of unvested restricted stock.  The dilutive effect of unvested restricted stock is determined using the treasury stock method.

    STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
       
  EastGroup applies the provisions of ASC 718,   Compensation - Stock Compensation,   to account for its stock-based compensation plans.  ASC 718 requires that the compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and that the cost be measured on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. 
    
  Stock-based compensation cost for employees was   $706,000   and   $4,371,000   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, of which   $232,000   and   $839,000   were capitalized as part of the Company's development costs.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, stock-based compensation cost for employees was   $1,855,000   and   $6,035,000  , respectively, of which   $410,000   and   $1,231,000   were capitalized as part of the Company's development costs.   
    
  Stock-based compensation expense for directors was $  161,000   and   $427,000   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $133,000   and   $381,000   for the same periods of 2015. 
    
  In the second quarter of 2016, the Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors (the Committee) approved an equity compensation plan for its executive officers based upon certain annual performance measures (primarily funds from operations (FFO) per share and total shareholder return).  Any shares issued pursuant to this compensation plan will be determined by the Committee in its discretion and issued in the first quarter of 2017.  The number of shares to be issued on the grant date could range from   zero   to   44,848  .  These shares would generally vest   20%   on the date shares are determined and awarded and   20%   per year on each January 1 for the subsequent four years. 
    
  Also in the second quarter of 2016, the Committee approved a long-term equity compensation plan for the Company s executive officers.  The awards will be based on the results of the Company's total shareholder return, both on an absolute basis for 2016 as well as on a relative basis compared to the NAREIT Equity Index, NAREIT Industrial Index and Russell 2000 Index over the five-year period ending December 31, 2016.  Any shares issued pursuant to this equity compensation plan will be determined by the Committee in its discretion and issued in the first quarter of 2017.  The number of shares to be issued on the grant date could range from   zero   to   47,275  .  These shares would generally vest   25%   on the date shares are determined and awarded and   25%   per year on each January 1 for the subsequent three years. 
    
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any shares issued to the Company s Chief Financial Officer, N. Keith McKey, under these plans will become fully vested on the grant date of the awards which is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2017. 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016,   15,250   shares were granted to certain non-executive officers subject only to continued service as of the vesting date. These shares, which have a grant date fair value of   $70.62   per share, will vest   20%   per year on January 1 in years 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. 
    
  Following is a summary of the total restricted shares granted, forfeited and delivered (vested) to participants with the related weighted average grant date fair value share prices.  Of the shares that vested in the first   nine   months of   2016  , the Company

withheld   57,316   shares to satisfy the tax obligations for those participants who elected this option as permitted under the applicable equity plan.  As of the vesting dates, the aggregate fair value of shares that vested during the first   nine   months of   2016   was   $10,013,000  .

    RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
       
  The state of the overall economy can significantly impact the Company s operational performance and thus impact its financial position.  Should EastGroup experience a significant decline in operational performance, it may affect the Company s ability to make distributions to its shareholders, service debt, or meet other financial obligations.

    RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
       
  EastGroup has evaluated all ASUs recently released by the FASB through the date the financial statements were issued and determined that the following ASUs apply to the Company. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers,   which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.  The FASB issued further guidance in ASU 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,   that provides clarifying guidance in certain narrow areas and adds some practical expedients.    ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective.  The effective date of ASU 2014-09 was extended by one year by ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date.    The new standard is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018.  The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.  The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures beginning with the Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2018.  The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standards on its ongoing financial reporting. 
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810):  Amendments to Consolidation Analysis,   under which all legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised consolidation model.  The ASU modifies whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities (VIEs) or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, and provides a scope exception from consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interests in legal entities that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds.  EastGroup adopted ASU 2015-02 effective January 1, 2016, and the adoption of ASU 2015-02 had an immaterial impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. For public business entities, the ASU was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities are to apply the new guidance on a retrospective basis, wherein the balance sheet of each individual period presented should be adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance. EastGroup adopted ASU 2015-03 effective January 1, 2016.  Prior to adoption, the Company included debt issuance costs in   Other assets   on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Beginning with the Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2016, EastGroup changed its presentation of debt issuance costs for all periods presented; the Company now presents debt issuance costs as direct deductions from the carrying amounts of its debt liabilities both on the Balance Sheet and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  As a result of the adoption of ASU 2015-03, the Company adjusted its December 31, 2015 Balance Sheet as follows:

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,  which requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes, requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset, and eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized costs on the balance sheet.  EastGroup plans to adopt ASU 2016-01 effective January 1, 2018.  The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2016-01 will have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842),   which requires lessees to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date:  (1) a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term.  Lessor accounting is largely unchanged under ASU 2016-02.  Public business entities are required to apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  EastGroup plans to adopt ASU 2016-02 effective January 1, 2019.  The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718):  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.    The ASU is intended to improve the accounting for share-based payments and affects all organizations that issue share-based payment awards to their employees.  Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment awards are simplified with the ASU, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-09 is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  EastGroup plans to adopt ASU 2016-09 effective January 1, 2017 and will provide the necessary disclosures beginning with its Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2017.  The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2016-09 will have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.   
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,   which addresses certain cash flow issues, including how debt prepayments or debt extinguishment costs and distributions received from equity method investees are presented.  ASU 2016-15 is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted, and the Company plans to adopt ASU 2016-15 effective January 1, 2017 and will provide the necessary disclosures beginning with its Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2017.    The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2016-15 will have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

    FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
       
  ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,   defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  ASC 820 also provides guidance for using fair value to measure financial assets and liabilities.  The Codification requires disclosure of the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall, including measurements using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active (Level 2), and significant valuation assumptions that are not readily observable in the market (Level 3). 
    
  The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments in accordance with ASC 820     at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

(1)  Carrying amounts shown in the table are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets under the indicated captions, except as explained      in the notes below. 
  (2)  Carrying amounts and fair values shown in the table exclude debt issuance costs (see Note 9 for additional information). 

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments: 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents:    The carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments. 
  Mortgage loans receivable (included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets):    The fair value is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities (Level 2 input). 
  Interest rate swap assets (included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets):    The instruments are recorded at fair value based on models using inputs, such as interest rate yield curves, LIBOR swap curves and OIS curves, observable for substantially the full term of the contract (Level 2 input).  See Note 13 for additional information on the Company's interest rate swaps. 
  Secured debt:   The fair value of the Company s secured debt is estimated by discounting expected cash flows at the rates currently offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities, as advised by the Company s bankers (Level 2 input), excluding the effects of debt issuance costs. 
  Unsecured debt:    The fair value of the Company s unsecured debt is estimated by discounting expected cash flows at the rates currently offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities, as advised by the Company s bankers (Level 2 input), excluding the effects of debt issuance costs. 
  Unsecured bank credit facilities:   The fair value of the Company s unsecured bank credit facilities is estimated by discounting expected cash flows at current market rates (Level 2 input), excluding the effects of debt issuance costs. 
  Interest rate swap liabilities (included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets):    The instruments are recorded at fair value based on models using inputs, such as interest rate yield curves, LIBOR swap curves and OIS curves, observable for substantially the full term of the contract (Level 2 input).  See Note 13 for additional information on the Company's interest rate swaps.

ITEM 2. 
    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

OVERVIEW 
  EastGroup s goal is to maximize shareholder value by being a leading provider in its markets of functional, flexible and quality business distribution space for location sensitive customers (primarily in the 5,000 to 50,000 square foot range).  The Company develops, acquires and operates distribution facilities, the majority of which are clustered around major transportation features in supply constrained submarkets in major Sunbelt regions.  The Company s core markets are in the states of Florida, Texas, Arizona, California and North Carolina. 
    
  EastGroup believes its current operating cash flow and unsecured bank credit facilities provide the capacity to fund the operations of the Company, and the Company also believes it can issue common and/or preferred equity and obtain debt financing.  During the first nine months of 2016, EastGroup closed two unsecured term loans totaling $105 million and issued   447,665   shares of common stock through its continuous common equity program, providing net proceeds to the Company of $29.6 million.  EastGroup's financing and equity issuances are further described in   Liquidity and Capital Resources  .    
    
  The Company s primary revenue source is rental income; as such, EastGroup s greatest challenge is leasing space.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , leases expired on 5,144,000 square feet (14.8% of EastGroup s total square footage of 34,767,000), and the Company was successful in renewing or re-leasing 88% of the expiring square feet.  In addition, EastGroup leased 1,458,000 square feet of other vacant space during this period.  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , average rental rates on new and renewal leases increased by 11.6%.  Property net operating income (PNOI) from same properties, defined as operating properties owned during the entire current period and prior year reporting period, increased 3.8% for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same quarter in   2015  .  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , PNOI from same properties increased 2.7% as compared to the same period in   2015  .  
    
  EastGroup s total leased percentage was 97.3% at   September 30, 2016  , compared to 96.6% at   September 30, 2015  .  Leases scheduled to expire for the remainder of   2016   were 1.9% of the portfolio on a square foot basis at   September 30, 2016  , and this percentage was reduced to 1.2% as of   October 20, 2016  . 
    
  The Company generates new sources of leasing revenue through its development and acquisition programs.  EastGroup continues to see targeted development as a contributor to the Company s long-term growth.  The Company mitigates risks associated with development through a Board-approved maximum level of land held for development and by adjusting development start dates according to leasing activity.    
    
  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , EastGroup acquired   97   acres of development land in Charlotte, San Antonio and Dallas for   $9.7 million  .  During the same period, the Company acquired Parc North, a   four  -building business distribution complex in Fort Worth (Dallas) for   $32 million  .  The buildings, which contain   446,000   square feet and are currently   42%   leased, were recently developed by the seller and are considered to be in the lease-up phase of development.  In addition, the Company began construction of seven development projects containing 793,000 square feet in San Antonio, Dallas, Tampa, Orlando and Fort Myers.  EastGroup also transferred   eight   properties (  728,000   square feet) in Houston, San Antonio, Tampa, Orlando and Phoenix from its development program to real estate properties with costs of   $48.3 million   at the date of transfer.  As of   September 30, 2016  , EastGroup s development program consisted of 14 projects (2,176,000 square feet) located in Orlando, Tampa, Fort Myers, Charlotte, Dallas, San Antonio and Phoenix.  The projected total investment for the development projects, which were collectively 45% leased as of   October 20, 2016  , is $162 million, of which $41 million remained to be invested as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Also during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company acquired Flagler Center, a   three  -building,   358,000   square foot business distribution complex in Jacksonville, Florida, for   $24 million  . 
    
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company sold 1,164,000 square feet of operating properties and 25 acres of land, generating gross sales proceeds of $79.5 million.  EastGroup recognized $42,313,000 in   Gain on sales of real estate investments   and $733,000 in   Gain on sales of non-operating real estate   (included in   Other   on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income) during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Typically, the Company initially funds its development and acquisition programs through its $335 million unsecured bank credit facilities (as discussed in   Liquidity and Capital Resources  ).  As market conditions permit, EastGroup issues equity and/or employs fixed-rate debt, including variable-rate debt that has been swapped to an effectively fixed rate through the use of interest rate swaps, to replace short-term bank borrowings.  In March 2016, Moody's Investors Service affirmed EastGroup's issuer rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook.  In April, Fitch Ratings affirmed EastGroup's issuer rating of BBB with a stable outlook.  A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the

assigning rating agency.  Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.  The Company intends to issue primarily unsecured fixed-rate debt, including variable-rate debt that has been swapped to an effectively fixed rate through the use of interest rate swaps, in the future.  The Company may also access the public debt market in the future as a means to raise capital. 
    
  EastGroup has one reportable segment   industrial properties.  These properties are primarily located in major Sunbelt regions of the United States, have similar economic characteristics and also meet the other criteria permitting the properties to be aggregated into one reportable segment.  The Company s chief decision makers use two primary measures of operating results in making decisions:  (1) property net operating income (PNOI), defined as   Income from real estate operations   less   Expenses from real estate operations   (including market-based internal management fee expense) plus the Company's share of income and property operating expenses from its less-than-wholly-owned real estate investments, and (2) funds from operations attributable to common stockholders (FFO), defined as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable real estate property and impairment losses, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  The Company calculates FFO based on the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts  (NAREIT) definition. 
    
  PNOI is a supplemental industry reporting measurement used to evaluate the performance of the Company s real estate investments. The Company believes the exclusion of depreciation and amortization in the industry s calculation of PNOI provides a supplemental indicator of the properties  performance since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions.  PNOI as calculated by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled but differently calculated measures for other real estate investment trusts (REITs).  The major factors influencing PNOI are occupancy levels, acquisitions and sales, development properties that achieve stabilized operations, rental rate increases or decreases, and the recoverability of operating expenses.  The Company s success depends largely upon its ability to lease space and to recover from tenants the operating costs associated with those leases. 
    
  PNOI is comprised of   Income from real estate operations  , less   Expenses from real estate operations   plus the Company's share of income and property operating expenses from its less-than-wholly-owned real estate investments.  PNOI was calculated as follows for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

Income from real estate operations   is comprised of rental income, expense reimbursement pass-through income and other real estate income including lease termination fees.    Expenses from real estate operations   is comprised of property taxes, insurance, utilities, repair and maintenance expenses, management fees, other operating costs and bad debt expense.  Generally, the Company s most significant operating expenses are property taxes and insurance.  Tenant leases may be net leases in which the total operating expenses are recoverable, modified gross leases in which some of the operating expenses are recoverable, or gross leases in which no expenses are recoverable (gross leases represent only a small portion of the Company s total leases).  Increases in property operating expenses are fully recoverable under net leases and recoverable to a high degree under modified gross leases.  Modified gross leases often include base year amounts and expense increases over these amounts are recoverable.  The Company s exposure to property operating expenses is primarily due to vacancies and leases for occupied space that limit the amount of expenses that can be recovered.

The following table presents reconciliations of Net Income to PNOI for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

The Company believes FFO is a meaningful supplemental measure of operating performance for equity REITs.  The Company believes excluding depreciation and amortization in the calculation of FFO is appropriate since real estate values have historically increased or decreased based on market conditions.  FFO is not considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of the Company s financial performance, nor is it a measure of the Company s liquidity or indicative of funds available to provide for the Company s cash needs, including its ability to make distributions.  In addition, FFO, as reported by the Company, may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition.  The Company s key drivers affecting FFO are changes in PNOI (as discussed above), interest rates, the amount of leverage the Company employs and general and administrative expenses.  The following table presents reconciliations of Net Income Attributable to EastGroup Properties, Inc. Common Stockholders to FFO Attributable to Common Stockholders for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

-  22  - 

The Company analyzes the following performance trends in evaluating the progress of the Company: 

The FFO change per share represents the increase or decrease in FFO per share from the current period compared to the same period in the prior year.  FFO per share for the   third   quarter of   2016   was   $1.04   per share compared with   $.94   per share for the same period of   2015  , an increase of 10.6%.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , FFO was   $2.94   per share compared with   $2.73   per share for the same period of   2015  , an increase of 7.7%.  

For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , PNOI increased by $7,888,000, or 6.3%, compared to the same period in   2015  .   PNOI increased $5,065,000 from newly developed and redeveloped properties, $3,167,000 from same property operations and $1,956,000 from 2015 and 2016 acquisitions; PNOI decreased $2,208,000 from properties sold in 2015 and 2016. 

The same property net operating income change represents the PNOI increase or decrease for the same operating properties owned during the entire current period and prior year reporting period.  PNOI from same properties increased 3.8% for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , and increased 2.7% for the   nine   months compared to the same periods in   2015  . 

Same property average occupancy represents the average month-end percentage of leased square footage for which the lease term has commenced as compared to the total leasable square footage for the same operating properties owned during the entire current period and prior year reporting period.  Same property average occupancy for the three months  ended   September 30, 2016  , was 96.3% compared to 95.9% for the same period of   2015  .  Same property average occupancy for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , was 96.1% compared to 96.2% for the same period of   2015  . 

The same property average rental rate calculated in accordance with GAAP represents the average annual rental rates of leases in place for the same operating properties owned during the entire current period and prior year reporting period.  The same property average rental rate was $5.63 per square foot for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to $5.26 per square foot for the same period of   2015  .  The same property average rental rate was $5.58 per square foot for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to $5.24 per square foot for the same period of   2015  . 

Occupancy is the percentage of leased square footage for which the lease term has commenced as compared to the total leasable square footage as of the close of the reporting period.  Occupancy at   September 30, 2016  , was 96.3%.  Quarter-end occupancy ranged from 95.7% to 96.1% over the previous four quarters ended   September 30, 2015   to June 30, 2016. 

Rental rate change represents the rental rate increase or decrease on new and renewal leases compared to the prior leases on the same space.  Rental rate increases on new and renewal leases (5.0% of total square footage) averaged 10.6% for the   third   quarter of   2016  .  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , rental rate increases on new and renewal leases (17.2% of total square footage) averaged 11.6%.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
    
  The Company s management considers the following accounting policies and estimates to be critical to the reported operations of the Company. 
    
  Real Estate Properties 
  The Company allocates the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair values.  Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired.  Factors considered by management in allocating the cost of the properties acquired include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases.  The allocation to tangible assets (land, building and improvements) is based upon management s determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models.  The purchase price is also allocated among the following categories of intangible assets:  the above or below market component of in-place leases, the value of in-place leases, and the value of customer relationships.  The value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in-place lease is determined based upon the present value (using a discount rate reflecting the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and (ii) management s estimate of the amounts that would be paid using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease.  The amounts allocated to above and below market leases are included in   Other assets   and   Other liabilities  , respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases.  The total amount of intangible assets is further allocated to in-place lease values and customer relationship values based upon management s assessment of their respective values.  These intangible assets are included in   Other assets   on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease or the anticipated life of the customer relationship, as applicable. 
    
  During the period in which a property is under development, costs associated with development (i.e., land, construction costs, interest expense, property taxes and other costs associated with development) are aggregated into the total capitalized costs of the property.  Included in these costs are management s estimates for the portions of internal costs (primarily personnel costs) deemed related to such development activities.  The internal costs are allocated to specific development properties based on development activity. 
    
  The Company reviews its real estate investments for impairment of value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  If any real estate investment is considered permanently impaired, a loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value.  Real estate assets to be sold are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs.  The evaluation of real estate investments involves many subjective assumptions dependent upon future economic events that affect the ultimate value of the property.  Currently, the Company s management does not believe any impairment charges should be recorded nor has it recorded any impairment charges in recent years.  In the event of impairment, the property s basis would be reduced, and the impairment would be recognized as a current period charge on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. 
    
  Valuation of Receivables 
  The Company is subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the collection of outstanding receivables.  In order to mitigate these risks, the Company performs credit reviews and analyses on prospective tenants before significant leases are executed and on existing tenants before properties are acquired.  On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates outstanding receivables and estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts.  Management specifically analyzes aged receivables, customer credit-worthiness, historical bad debts and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.  The Company believes its allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate for its outstanding receivables for the periods presented.  In the event the allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient for an account that is subsequently written off, additional bad debt expense would be recognized as a current period charge on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. 
    
  Tax Status 
  EastGroup, a Maryland corporation, has qualified as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code and intends to continue to qualify as such.  To maintain its status as a REIT, the Company is required to distribute at least 90% of its ordinary taxable income to its stockholders.  If the Company has a capital gain, it has the option of (i) deferring recognition of the capital gain through a tax-deferred exchange, (ii) declaring and paying a capital gain dividend on any recognized net capital gain resulting in no corporate level tax, or (iii) retaining and paying corporate income tax on its net long-term capital gain, with shareholders reporting their proportional share of the undistributed long-term capital gain and receiving a credit or refund of their share of the tax paid by the Company.  The Company distributed all of its 2015 taxable income to its stockholders and expects to distribute all of its taxable income in 2016.  Accordingly, no significant provision for income taxes was necessary in 2015, nor is any significant income tax provision expected to be necessary for 2016.

  Assets 
    
  Real Estate Properties 
  Real estate properties     increased   $  40,673,000   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to the transfer of   eight   properties from   Development  , as detailed under   Development   below; the purchase of Flagler Center; and capital improvements at the Company's properties.  These increases were partially offset by the operating property sales discussed below.  
    
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , EastGroup acquired Flagler Center, a   three  -building,   358,000   square foot complex in Jacksonville, Florida, for   $24,011,000  , of which   $22,228,000   was allocated to   Real estate properties  .  EastGroup allocated $7,317,000 of the total purchase price to land using third party land valuations for the Jacksonville market.  The market values are considered to be Level 3 inputs as defined by ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   (see Note 18 for additional information on ASC 820).  Intangibles associated with the purchase of Flagler were allocated as follows: $2,020,000 to in-place lease intangibles and   $342,000   to above market leases (both included in   Other assets   on the Consolidated Balance Sheets), and $579,000 to below market leases (included in   Other liabilities   on the Consolidated Balance Sheets).

  Development 
  EastGroup s investment in development at   September 30, 2016   consisted of properties in lease-up and under construction of $121,368,000 and prospective development (primarily land) of   $85,452,000  .  The Company s total investment in development at   September 30, 2016   was $  206,820,000   compared to $  170,441,000   at   December 31, 2015  .  Total capital invested for development during the first   nine   months of   2016   was   $94,781,000  , which primarily consisted of costs of   $81,961,000   and   $2,678,000   as detailed in the   Development Activity   table below and costs of   $5,823,000   on development properties subsequent to transfer to   Real estate properties  .  The capitalized costs incurred on development properties subsequent to transfer to   Real estate properties   include capital improvements at the properties and do not include other capitalized costs associated with development (i.e., interest expense, property taxes and internal personnel costs). 
    
  The Company capitalized internal development costs of   $867,000   and   $2,660,000   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $1,223,000   and   $3,265,000   in the same periods of   2015  .  
    
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , EastGroup acquired Parc North, a   four  -building business distribution complex in Fort Worth (Dallas), Texas, for   $31,928,000  , of which   $30,984,000   was allocated to   Development  .  The Company allocated $4,615,000 of the total purchase price to land using third party land valuations for the Dallas market.  The market values are considered to be Level 3 inputs as defined by ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   (see Note 18 for additional information on ASC 820).  Intangibles associated with the purchase of real estate were allocated as follows: $1,167,000 to in-place lease intangibles (included in   Other assets   on the Consolidated Balance Sheets) and $223,000 to below market leases (included in   Other liabilities   on the Consolidated Balance Sheets).  The buildings, which contain   446,000   square feet and are currently   42%   leased, were recently developed by the seller and are considered to be in the lease-up phase of development. 
    
  EastGroup also purchased   97   acres of development land in Charlotte, San Antonio and Dallas for   $9,658,000  .  Costs associated with these land acquisitions are included in the   Development Activity   table below.  These increases were offset by the sale of 25 acres of land for $5,390,000 during the first nine months of   2016  . 
    
  The Company transferred   eight   development properties to   Real estate properties   during the first   nine   months of   2016   with a total investment of   $48,260,000   as of the date of transfer.

Accumulated Depreciation 
  Accumulated depreciation on real estate and development properties   increased   $  22,494,000   during the first   nine   months of   2016   due primarily to depreciation expense, offset by the sale of 1.2 million square feet of operating properties during the period. 
    
  Other Assets 
  Other assets     increased   $  2,293,000   during the first   nine   months of   2016  .  A summary of   Other assets   follows: 

Liabilities 
  Secured debt     decreased   $  89,375,000   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The   decrease   primarily resulted from the repayment of two mortgage loans with a combined balance of $75,737,000 and regularly scheduled principal payments of   $13,558,000  .   
    
  Unsecured debt     increased     $24,825,000   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to the closing of a $65 million unsecured term loan in April 2016 and a $40 million unsecured term loan in July 2016.  These increases were offset by the repayment of an $80 million unsecured term loan in August 2016. 
    
  Unsecured bank credit facilities     increased   $  56,037,000   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , mainly due to  proceeds of   $444,314,000   exceeding repayments of   $388,569,000   during the period.

  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   Distributions in excess of earnings     decreased   $  20,594,000   as a result of   Net Income Attributable to EastGroup Properties, Inc. Common Stockholders   of   $80,285,000   exceeding dividends on common stock of $  59,691,000  . 
    
  Accumulated other comprehensive loss   increased   $6,253,000   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
  EastGroup has evaluated all ASUs recently released by the FASB through the date the financial statements were issued and determined that the following ASUs apply to the Company. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers,   which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.  The FASB issued further guidance in ASU 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,   that provides clarifying guidance in certain narrow areas and adds some practical expedients.  ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective.  The effective date of ASU 2014-09 was extended by one year by ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date.    The new standard is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018.  The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.  The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures beginning with the Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2018.  The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standards on its ongoing financial reporting. 
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810):  Amendments to Consolidation Analysis,   under which all legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised consolidation model.  The ASU modifies whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities (VIEs) or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, and provides a scope exception from consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interests in legal entities that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds.  EastGroup adopted ASU 2015-02 effective January 1, 2016, and the adoption of ASU 2015-02 had an immaterial impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. For public business entities, the ASU was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities are to apply the new guidance on a retrospective basis, wherein the balance sheet of each individual period presented should be adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance. EastGroup adopted ASU 2015-03 effective January 1, 2016.  Prior to adoption, the Company included debt issuance costs in   Other assets   on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Beginning with the Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2016, EastGroup changed its presentation of debt issuance costs for all periods presented; the Company now presents debt issuance costs as direct deductions from the carrying amounts of its debt liabilities both on the Balance Sheet and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  As a result of the adoption of ASU 2015-03, the Company adjusted its December 31, 2015 Balance Sheet as follows: 

-  34  - 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,  which requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes, requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset, and eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized costs on the balance sheet.  EastGroup plans to adopt ASU 2016-01 effective January 1, 2018.  The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2016-01 will have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842),   which requires lessees to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date:  (1) a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term.  Lessor accounting is largely unchanged under ASU 2016-02.  Public business entities are required to apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  EastGroup plans to adopt ASU 2016-02 effective January 1, 2019.  The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718):  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.    The ASU is intended to improve the accounting for share-based payments and affects all organizations that issue share-based payment awards to their employees.  Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment awards are simplified with the ASU, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-09 is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  EastGroup plans to adopt ASU 2016-09 effective January 1, 2017 and will provide the necessary disclosures beginning with its Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2017.  The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2016-09 will have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.   
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,   which addresses certain cash flow issues, including how debt prepayments or debt extinguishment costs and distributions received from equity method investees are presented.  ASU 2016-15 is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted, and the Company plans to adopt ASU 2016-15 effective January 1, 2017 and will provide the necessary disclosures beginning with its Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2017.  The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2016-15 will have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.   

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities was $  106,952,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The primary other sources of cash were borrowings on unsecured bank credit facilities, proceeds from unsecured debt, proceeds from sales of real estate investments and non-operating real estate and proceeds from common stock offerings.  The Company distributed $  60,418,000   in common stock dividends during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Other primary uses of cash were for repayments on unsecured bank credit facilities, secured debt and unsecured debt; the construction and development of properties; purchases of real estate and capital improvements at various properties. 
    
  Total debt at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is detailed below.  The Company s unsecured bank credit facilities and unsecured term loans have certain restrictive covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage, and the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  
   -  35  - 

(1) 
    These loans have a fixed interest rate or an effectively fixed interest rate due to interest rate swaps. 
       
  EastGroup has a $300 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of nine banks that matures in July 2019.  The credit facility contains options for a one-year extension (at the Company's election) and a $150 million expansion (with agreement by all parties).  The interest rate on each tranche is usually reset on a monthly basis and as of   September 30, 2016  , was LIBOR plus 100 basis points with an annual facility fee of 20 basis points.  The margin and facility fee are subject to changes in the Company's credit ratings.  The Company has designated an interest rate swap to an $80 million unsecured bank credit facility draw that effectively fixes the interest rate on the $80 million draw to 2.020% through the interest rate swap's maturity date of August 15, 2018.  As of   September 30, 2016  , EastGroup had an additional $111,000,000 of variable rate borrowings on this unsecured bank credit facility with a weighted average interest rate of 1.527%. 
     
  The Company also has a $35 million unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in July 2019.  This credit facility automatically extends for one year if the extension option in the $300 million revolving credit facility is exercised.  The interest rate is reset on a daily basis and as of   September 30, 2016  , was LIBOR plus 100 basis points with an annual facility fee of 20 basis points.  The margin and facility fee are subject to changes in the Company's credit ratings.  At   September 30, 2016  , the interest rate was 1.531% on a balance of $15,581,000.  
    
  As market conditions permit, EastGroup issues equity and/or employs fixed-rate debt, including variable-rate debt that has been swapped to an effectively fixed rate through the use of interest rate swaps, to replace the short-term bank borrowings.  The Company believes its current operating cash flow and unsecured bank credit facilities provide the capacity to fund the operations of the Company.  The Company also believes it can obtain debt financing and issue common and/or preferred equity.  The Company intends to issue primarily unsecured fixed-rate debt, including variable-rate debt that has been swapped to an effectively fixed rate through the use of interest rate swaps, in the future.  The Company may also access the public debt market in the future as a means to raise capital.   
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company issued and sold   447,665   shares of common stock under its continuous equity program at an average price of $67.01 per share with gross proceeds to the Company of $30,000,000.  The Company incurred offering-related costs of $357,000 during the nine months, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of   $29,643,000  .  As of   October 21, 2016  , the Company has   8,199,184   shares of common stock remaining to sell under the program.   
    
  In April 2016, EastGroup closed a $65 million senior unsecured term loan with a seven-year term and interest only payments.  It bears interest at the annual rate of LIBOR plus an applicable margin (currently 1.65%) based on the Company's senior unsecured long-term debt rating.  The Company also entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert the loan's LIBOR rate component to a fixed interest rate for the entire term of the loan providing a total effective fixed interest rate of 2.863%. 
    
  In July 2016, EastGroup closed a $40 million senior unsecured term loan with a five-year term and interest only payments.  It bears interest at the annual rate of LIBOR plus an applicable margin (currently 1.10%) based on the Company's senior unsecured long-term debt rating.  The Company also entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert the loan's LIBOR rate component to a fixed interest rate for the entire term of the loan providing a total effective fixed interest rate of 2.335%. 
  
   -  36  - 

In August 2016, EastGroup repaid (with no penalty) a mortgage loan with a balance of $24.5 million, an interest rate of 5.68%, and an original maturity date of September 5, 2016. In September 2016, the Company repaid (with no penalty) a mortgage loan with a balance of $51.2 million, an interest rate of 5.97% and an original maturity date of October 5, 2016. 
    
  In August 2016, EastGroup repaid (with no penalty) an $80 million unsecured term loan with an effectively fixed interest rate of 2.770% and an original maturity date of August 15, 2018.  On the same day, the Company borrowed $80 million through its $300 million unsecured bank credit facility (as discussed above); the maturity date for the credit facility is July 30, 2019.  The Company re-designated the interest rate swap that was previously applied to the $80 million unsecured term loan to the $80 million unsecured bank credit facility borrowing.  The $80 million unsecured bank credit facility draw has an effectively fixed interest rate of 2.020% through the interest rate swap's maturity date of August 15, 2018. 
    
  The Company anticipates that its current cash balance, operating cash flows, borrowings under its unsecured bank credit facilities, proceeds from new unsecured debt and/or proceeds from the issuance of equity instruments will be adequate for (i) operating and administrative expenses, (ii) normal repair and maintenance expenses at its properties, (iii) debt service obligations, (iv) maintaining compliance with its debt covenants, (v) distributions to stockholders, (vi) capital improvements, (vii) purchases of properties, (viii) development, and (ix) any other normal business activities of the Company, both in the short-term and long-term. 
    
  Contractual Obligations 
  EastGroup s fixed, non-cancelable obligations as of   December 31, 2015  , did not materially change during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , except for the increase in   Unsecured debt   and   Unsecured bank credit facilities   and the decreases in   Secured debt   discussed above. 

INFLATION AND OTHER ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS 
    
  Most of the Company's leases include scheduled rent increases.  Additionally, most of the Company's leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses, including real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance, thereby reducing the Company's exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation.  In the event inflation causes increases in the Company s general and administrative expenses or the level of interest rates, such increased costs would not be passed through to tenants and could adversely affect the Company s results of operations. 
    
  EastGroup's financial results are affected by general economic conditions in the markets in which the Company's properties are located.  The state of the economy, or other adverse changes in general or local economic conditions, could result in the inability of some of the Company's existing tenants to make lease payments and may therefore increase bad debt expense.  It may also impact the Company s ability to (i) renew leases or re-lease space as leases expire, or (ii) lease development space.  In addition, an economic downturn or recession could also lead to an increase in overall vacancy rates or a decline in rents the Company can charge to re-lease properties upon expiration of current leases.  In all of these cases, EastGroup s cash flows would be adversely affected. 

ITEM 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
       
  The Company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its unsecured bank credit facilities and long-term debt maturities.  This debt is used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the Company s real estate investment portfolio and operations.  The Company s objective for interest rate risk management is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs.  The Company has two variable rate unsecured bank credit facilities as discussed under   Liquidity and Capital Resources  .  As market conditions permit, EastGroup issues equity and/or employs fixed-rate debt, including variable-rate debt that has been swapped to an effectively fixed rate through the use of interest rate swaps, to replace the short-term bank borrowings.  The Company's interest rate swaps are discussed in Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  The table below presents the principal payments due and weighted average interest rates, which include the impact of interest rate swaps, for both the fixed-rate and variable-rate debt as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  
   -  37  - 

(1) 
    The fair value of the Company s fixed-rate debt, including variable-rate debt that has been swapped to an effectively fixed rate through the use of interest rate swaps, is estimated by discounting expected cash flows at the rates currently offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities, as advised by the Company s bankers, excluding the effects of debt issuance costs. 
               (3) 
    The fair value of the Company s variable rate debt is estimated by discounting expected cash flows at current market rates, excluding the effects of debt issuance costs. 
              (4) 
    Represents the weighted average interest rate for the Company's variable rate unsecured bank credit facilities as of   September 30, 2016  .  
       
  As the table above incorporates only those exposures that existed as of   September 30, 2016  , it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date.  If the weighted average interest rate on the variable rate unsecured bank credit facilities, as shown above, changes by 10% or approximately 15 basis points, interest expense and cash flows would increase or decrease by approximately $194,000 annually.  This does not include variable-rate debt that has been effectively fixed through the use of interest rate swaps. 
    
  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
    
  Certain statements contained in this report may be deemed  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Words such as  will,   anticipates,   expects,   believes,   intends,   plans,   seeks,   estimates,  variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature.  All statements that address operating performance, events or developments that the Company expects or anticipates will occur in the future, including statements relating to rent and occupancy growth, development activity, the acquisition or sale of properties, general conditions in the geographic areas where the Company operates and the availability of capital, are forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which the Company cannot predict, including, without limitation: changes in general economic conditions; the extent of tenant defaults or of any early lease terminations; the Company's ability to lease or re-lease space at current or anticipated rents; the availability of financing; the failure to maintain credit ratings with rating agencies; changes in the supply of and demand for industrial/warehouse properties; increases in interest rate levels; increases in operating costs; natural disasters, terrorism, riots and acts of war, and the Company's ability to obtain adequate insurance; changes in governmental regulation, tax rates and similar matters; and other risks associated with the development and acquisition of properties, including risks that development projects may not be completed on schedule, development or operating costs may be greater than anticipated or acquisitions may not close as scheduled, and those additional factors discussed under  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in Part II of this report and in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions at the time made, the Company can give no assurance that such expectations will be achieved.  The Company assumes no obligation whatsoever to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.  See also the information contained in the Company s reports filed or to be filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ).

  There was no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the Company's   third   fiscal quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
