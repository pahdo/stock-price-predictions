1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

The Company   

We are a specialty pharmaceutical company
developing proprietary therapeutics for the treatment of serious medical disorders. Our product development programs utilize our
proprietary long-term drug delivery platform, ProNeura   , and focus primarily on innovative treatments for select chronic
diseases for which steady state delivery of a drug provides an efficacy and/or safety benefit. We are directly developing our product
candidates and also utilize corporate, academic and government partnerships as appropriate. We operate in only one business segment,
the development of pharmaceutical products. All share and per share amounts give retroactive effect to a 1 for 5.5 reverse stock
split effected in September 2015. See Note 7  Stockholders  Equity   Reverse Stock Split.  

Basis of Presentation   

The accompanying unaudited condensed financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim
financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not
include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statement presentation. In the opinion
of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been
included. Operating results for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the
results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016, or any future interim periods. 

The balance sheet at December 31,
2015 has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes
required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. These unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the audited financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Titan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). 

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

The accompanying financial statements have
been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. 

In May 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
( FDA ) approved our Probuphine New Drug Application ( NDA ) and pursuant to our license agreement with
Braeburn Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Braeburn ), as amended to date, we received a $15 million milestone payment and subsequently
transferred the NDA to Braeburn. 

At September 30, 2016, we had cash of approximately
$16.5 million, which we believe is sufficient to fund our planned operations into early 2018. We will require additional funds,
either through payments from Braeburn under the license agreement or through other financing arrangements, to advance our current
ProNeura development programs to later stage clinical studies and to complete the regulatory approval process necessary to commercialize
any products we might develop. 

Revenue Recognition   

We generate revenue principally from technology
licenses, collaborative research and development arrangements, and government grants. Consideration received for revenue arrangements
with multiple components is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their respective selling prices. The selling
price for each unit is based on vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, if available, third party evidence if VSOE is not
available, or estimated selling price if neither VSOE nor third party evidence is available. The applicable revenue recognition
criteria are then applied to each of the units. 

Revenue is recognized when the four basic
criteria of revenue recognition are met: (1) a contractual agreement exists; (2) transfer of technology has been completed
or services have been rendered; (3) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. For
each source of revenue, we comply with the above revenue recognition criteria in the following manner: 

Technology license agreements typically consist of non-refundable upfront license fees, annual minimum access fees or royalty payments. Non-refundable upfront license fees and annual minimum payments received with separable stand-alone values are recognized when the technology is transferred or accessed, provided that the technology transferred or accessed is not dependent on the outcome of our continuing research and development efforts.   

Royalties earned are based on third-party sales of licensed products and are recorded in accordance with contract terms when third-party results are reliably measurable and collectability is reasonably assured.     

Government grants, which support our research efforts in specific projects, generally provide for reimbursement of approved costs as defined in the notices of grants. Grant revenue is recognized when associated project costs are incurred.    

Collaborative arrangements typically consist of non-refundable and/or exclusive technology access fees, cost reimbursements for specific research and development spending, and various milestone and future product royalty payments. If the delivered technology does not have stand-alone value, the amount of revenue allocable to the delivered technology is deferred. Non-refundable upfront fees with stand-alone value that are not dependent on future performance under these agreements are recognized as revenue when received, and are deferred if we have continuing performance obligations and have no evidence of fair value of those obligations. Cost reimbursements for research and development spending are recognized when the related costs are incurred and when collections are reasonably expected. Payments received related to substantive, performance-based  at-risk  milestones are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the clinical success or regulatory event specified in the underlying contracts, which represent the culmination of the earnings process. Amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue until the technology is transferred, costs are incurred, or a milestone is reached.   

Research and Development Costs and Related Accrual   

Research and development expenses include
internal and external costs. Internal costs include salaries and employment related expenses, facility costs, administrative expenses
and allocations of corporate costs. External expenses consist of costs associated with outsourced clinical research organization
( CRO ) activities, sponsored research studies, product registration, patent application and prosecution, and investigator
sponsored trials. We also record accruals for estimated ongoing clinical trial costs. Clinical trial costs represent costs incurred
by CROs and clinical sites. These costs are recorded as a component of research and development expenses. Under our agreements,
progress payments are typically made to investigators, clinical sites and CROs. We analyze the progress of the clinical trials,
including levels of patient enrollment, invoices received and contracted costs when evaluating the adequacy of accrued liabilities.
Significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in determining the accrued balance in any accounting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates under different assumptions. Revisions are charged to expense in the period in which the facts
that give rise to the revision become known. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ( ASU 2014-09 ), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition
guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services.
ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required
within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP. 

The standard is effective for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein, using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective
approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients,
or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption
(which includes additional footnote disclosures). We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2014-09
on our financial statements and have not yet determined the method by which we will adopt the standard. 

In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12,
 Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the
Requisite Service Period  ( ASU 2014-12 ). The standard provides guidance that a performance target that affects
vesting of a share-based payment and that could be achieved after the requisite service condition is a performance condition. ASU
2014-12 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this ASU did not have a significant
impact on our financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
 Leases (Topic 842) , which supersedes the existing guidance for lease accounting,  Leases (Topic 840) . ASU 2016-02
requires lessees to recognize leases on their balance sheets, and leaves lessor accounting largely unchanged. The amendments in
this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early
application is permitted for all entities. ASU 2016-02 requires a modified retrospective approach for all leases existing at, or
entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to elect to use certain transition relief. We are currently
evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our financial statements. 

In August 2016, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification
of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,  addressing eight specific cash flow issues in an effort to reduce diversity in
practice. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, and for interim periods within
those years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the amended guidance to have a material impact on its statements
of cash flows. 

Subsequent Events   

We have evaluated events that have occurred
after September 30, 2016 and through the date that the financial statements are issued. 

Fair Value Measurements   

We measure the fair value of financial
assets and liabilities based on authoritative guidance which defines fair value, establishes a framework consisting of three levels
for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that
would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for
the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of
inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1   quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities; 

 Level 2   quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities
in active markets or inputs that are observable; 

 Level 3   inputs that are unobservable (for example cash
flow modeling inputs based on assumptions). 

Financial instruments, including receivables,
accounts payable and accrued liabilities are carried at cost, which we believe approximates fair value due to the short-term nature
of these instruments. Our warrant liabilities are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the value is calculated
using significant judgment based on our own assumptions in the valuation of these liabilities. 

As a result of the fair value adjustment
of the warrant liabilities, we recorded a non-cash loss on an increase in the fair value of $5,000 and $0.1 million for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, in our Condensed Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).
See Note 6,  Warrant Liability  for further discussion on the calculation of the fair value of the warrant liability. 

2. Stock Plans  

The following table summarizes the stock-based
compensation expense recorded for awards under the stock option plans for the three and nine month periods ended September 30,
2016 and 2015: 

No tax benefit was recognized related to
stock-based compensation expense since we have accumulated operating losses and we have established a full valuation allowance
to offset all the potential tax benefits associated with our deferred tax assets. 

We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing
model with the following assumptions to estimate the stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

(1)    Expected holding period
is based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock-based awards,
vesting schedules and the expectations of future employee behavior.  

(2)    Weighted average volatility
is based on the historical volatility of our common stock.  

(3)    Estimated forfeiture rates
are based on historical data.  

No options were granted during the three
month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

The following table summarizes option activity
for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016: 

No shares of restricted stock were awarded
to employees, directors and consultants during the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

As of September 30, 2016, there was approximately
$0.9 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock options. This expense is expected to be recognized
over a weighted-average period of 1.1 years. 

3. Net Income (Loss) Per Share  

Basic net income (loss) per share excludes
the effect of dilution and is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the
period. Diluted net income (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to
issue shares were exercised into shares. In calculating diluted net income (loss) per share, the numerator is adjusted for the
change in the fair value of the warrant liability (only if dilutive) and the denominator is increased to include the number of
potentially dilutive common shares assumed to be outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. 

The following table sets forth the reconciliation
of the numerator and denominator used in the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

The table below presents common shares
underlying stock options and warrants that are excluded from the calculation of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
used for the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per common share. These are excluded from the calculation due to their anti-dilutive
effect for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

4. Comprehensive Income (Loss)  

Comprehensive income (loss) for the periods
presented is comprised solely of our net income (loss). We had no items of other comprehensive income (loss) during the three and
nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Comprehensive loss for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 was
$2.6 million. Comprehensive income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 was $7.5 million. Comprehensive loss for
the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015 was $1.8 million and $9.0 million, respectively. 

5. Braeburn License  

We are party to a license agreement with
Braeburn pursuant to which we have granted Braeburn the exclusive commercialization rights to Probuphine in the United States and
its territories and Canada. Under the agreement (as amended to date, the  Agreement ), we received a non-refundable
license fee of $15.75 million (approximately $15.0 million net of expenses) in December 2012 and received a $15.0 million milestone
payment upon FDA approval of the Probuphine NDA in May 2016. We are entitled to receive royalties on net sales of Probuphine ranging
in percentage from the mid-teens to the low twenties. Upon receipt of approval, our obligation was fulfilled and we recognized
the full amount of the milestone payment in accordance with the milestone method of revenue recognition. The Agreement also provides
for up to $165 million in sales milestones and $35 million in regulatory milestones. In addition, we are entitled to receive a
low single digit royalty on sales by Braeburn, if any, of other competing continuous delivery treatments for opioid dependence
as defined in the Agreement, and can also elect to receive a low single digit royalty on sales by Braeburn, if any, of other products
in the addiction market in exchange for a similar reduction in our royalties on Probuphine. We are entitled to be reimbursed by
Braeburn for any development services and activities undertaken by us at Braeburn s request. 

6. Warrant Liability  

We currently have outstanding warrants
to purchase an aggregate of 983,395 shares of common stock ( Series A Warrants ). The Series A Warrants are exercisable
at $4.89 per share and expire in April 2018.  The Series A Warrants contain a provision where the warrant holder has the option
to receive cash, equal to the Black Scholes fair value of the remaining unexercised portion of the warrant, as cash settlement
in the event that there is a fundamental transaction (contractually defined to include various merger, acquisition or stock transfer
activities). Due to this provision, ASC 480,  Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity  requires that these warrants be classified
as liabilities. The fair values of these warrants have been determined using the Lattice valuation model, and the changes in the
fair value are recorded in the Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). The Lattice model provides for assumptions
regarding volatility and risk-free interest rates within the total period to maturity.    

The key assumptions used to value the Series A Warrants were
as follows: 

In October 2014, we completed an underwritten
public offering (the  2014 Offering ) of units consisting of one share of common stock and 0.75 of a warrant ( Class
A Warrant ). The Class A Warrants entitle the holders thereof to purchase an aggregate of 2,863,643 shares of our common
stock at an exercise price of $3.30 per share and expire in October 2020. There were 847,569 Class A Warrants outstanding
at September 30, 2016. 

We agreed to hold a stockholders meeting
no later than August 31, 2015 in order to seek stockholder approval for an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to either
(i) increase the number of shares of common stock we are authorized to issue or (ii) effect a reverse split of the common stock,
in either case in an amount sufficient to permit the exercise in full of the Class A Warrants in accordance with their terms. Failure
to effect an increase in our authorized shares of common stock or effect a reverse split of our common stock prior to October 9,
2015 would have required us to pay liquidated damages in the aggregate amount of $2,500,000. In September 2015, we effected a 1-for-5.5
reverse split of our common stock (the  Reverse Split ), which was within the range approved by our stockholders at
the annual meeting held on August 24, 2015. 

We also agreed to issue to the underwriter
of the 2014 Offering warrants to purchase 114,546 shares of common stock (the  Underwriter Warrants ). The Underwriter
Warrants have an exercise price per share of $3.30 and may be exercised on a cashless basis. The Underwriter Warrants are not redeemable
by us. The Underwriter Warrants are substantially the same as the Class A Warrants included in the units except that they expire
in October 2019. 

At the time these warrants were issued,
we did not have adequate authorized and unissued shares of common stock to be able to satisfy the exercise of these warrants. ASC
480,  Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity  required that these warrants be classified as liabilities. The fair values of
these warrants have been determined using the Lattice valuation model, and the changes in the fair value are recorded in the Statements
of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). The Lattice model provides for assumptions regarding volatility and risk-free interest
rates within the total period to maturity. On September 29, 2015, we effected the Reverse Split, which will permit the exercise
in full of the Class A Warrants in accordance with their terms and, accordingly, the associated warrant liability was reclassified
to stockholders  equity. 

7. Stockholders  Equity   

Common Stock    

In May and June 2016, 1,072,307 shares
of common stock were issued upon the cashless net exercise of 2,016,075 Class A Warrants in accordance with their terms. There
were 847,569 Class A Warrants outstanding at September 30, 2016. 

In May and June 2016, 58,569 shares of
common stock were issued upon the cashless net exercise of 114,546 Underwriter Warrants in accordance with their terms. There were
no remaining Underwriter Warrants outstanding at September 30, 2016. 

Reverse Stock Split   

On September 29, 2015, pursuant to prior
stockholder authorization, our Board effected the Reverse Split of the outstanding shares of our common stock with the result that
every five and one-half (5.5) outstanding shares of common stock before the Reverse Split represents one (1) share of common stock
after the Reverse Split. Pursuant to their respective terms, the number of shares underlying our outstanding options and warrants
was reduced by, and their respective exercise prices were increased by, the Reverse Split ratio. 

All share and per share amounts in the
accompanying financial statements have been restated for all periods presented to give retroactive effect to the Reverse Split.
The shares of common stock retain a par value of $0.001 per share. 

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

The following discussion contains  forward-looking
statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ). Such statements include, but are not limited to, any statements relating to our product
development programs and any other statements that are not historical facts. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties that
could negatively affect our business, operating results, financial condition and stock price. Factors that could cause actual results
to differ materially from management s current expectations include those risks and uncertainties relating to the commercialization
of Probuphine   , the regulatory approval process, the development, testing, production and marketing of our drug candidates,
patent and intellectual property matters and strategic agreements and relationships. We expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking
to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in our expectations
or any changes in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except as required by law.  

Probuphine  and ProNeura 
are trademarks of Titan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Overview    

We are a specialty pharmaceutical company
developing proprietary therapeutics for the treatment of serious medical disorders. Our product development programs utilize our
proprietary long-term drug delivery platform, ProNeura , and focus primarily on innovative treatments for select chronic
diseases for which steady state delivery of a drug provides an efficacy and/or safety benefit. 

Probuphine , our first product candidate
based on the ProNeura platform, was approved by the FDA on May 26, 2016 for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence in patients
who are stable on low to moderate doses of daily sublingual buprenorphine treatment. We have licensed development and commercialization
rights of Probuphine for the U.S. and Canadian markets to Braeburn Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Braeburn) and pursuant to the license
agreement as amended to date, we received a $15 million milestone payment upon FDA approval of the Probuphine NDA, and we are entitled
to receive royalties on net sales of Probuphine ranging in percentage from the mid-teens to the low twenties based on a tiered
structure. The agreement also provides for up to an additional $165 million in sales milestones and $35 million in regulatory milestones
and entitles us to a low single digit royalty on net sales by Braeburn, if any, of other future competing products in the addiction
market, e.g. a monthly depot injection. 

Braeburn commenced commercialization activities
in support of Probuphine product launch immediately following FDA approval starting with implementation at the end of May 2016
of the REMS directed training program for qualified health care providers. Braeburn has focused on two areas that are key to a
successful launch for Probuphine, specifically, 

(i)  training of health care providers on the use of Probuphine, the procedures for implantation and removal, and the selection
of eligible patients   

a.  Over 2400 health care providers from all 50 states and Puerto Rico have already been certified to provide Probuphine to their
patients, and Braeburn has continued to conduct additional training programs as needed.   

b.  Probuphine was made available to patients in June 2016 and the first patients were treated before the end of that month.   

(ii)   obtaining third party payor coverage for Probuphine and the procedure.   

a.  Probuphine is now being reimbursed by several insurance companies, including coverage under Medicare and Medicaid and Veterans
Administration programs.   

As with any new form of medical treatment,
it has been necessary to train the physician office staff and supply chain staff on new procedures for approval and reimbursement
for Probuphine and Braeburn is now focused on these activities to minimize delays in making the product available to patients.
Braeburn continues to devote substantial resources to the launch activities and has expanded their staff to support the health
care providers through the entire process. 

We believe that our ProNeura long
term drug delivery platform has the potential to be used in the treatment of other chronic conditions where maintaining
stable, around the clock blood levels of a medication may benefit the patient and improve medical outcomes. We have two
products in early development using the ProNeura platform, an implant designed to provide long-term delivery of ropinirole, a
dopamine agonist approved as a daily dosed oral formulation for the treatment of Parkinson s disease, and an implant
designed to provide long-term delivery of T3, a synthetic thyroid hormone approved as a daily dosed oral formulation for the
treatment of hypothyroidism. In December 2015, we submitted briefing material to the FDA on the development plans for the
ropinirole implant in support of a pre-Investigational New Drug ( IND ) meeting request, and in late January 2016
we received feedback from the FDA on our product development plans. The required non-clinical studies with the ropinirole
implant required in support of an IND application have been completed and final reports are being prepared. The last of these
reports are expected this month and will enable us to submit the IND  at the end of the year or early January 2017 and
commence a  proof of concept  clinical study soon thereafter, once the IND is accepted by the FDA. Early stage
development of the T3 implant continues and we are currently conducting non-clinical studies to optimize the formulation. We
expect to finalize the initial development plans for the T3 implant and request a pre-IND meeting with the FDA by the end
of 2016 and hope to submit  the IND in the second half of 2017 and commence a  proof of concept  clinical study thereafter. Our goal is to
further expand the product pipeline, and we are currently evaluating other drugs and disease settings for opportunities to
use the ProNeura platform in potential treatment applications where conventional treatment is limited by variability in blood
drug levels and poor patient compliance.  

We operate in only one business segment,
the development of pharmaceutical products. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements    

See Note 1 to the accompanying unaudited
condensed financial statements included in Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information on recent
accounting pronouncements. 

Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended
September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015   

License revenues of approximately $26,000
for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 reflect the recognition of royalties earned on net sales of Probuphine. License
revenues of approximately $15.0 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 primarily reflect the recognition of
the milestone payment earned upon FDA approval of our Probuphine NDA in May 2016. License revenues of approximately $1.7 million
for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 reflect the amortization of the upfront license fee received from Braeburn in
December 2012.  

Research and development expenses for the
three month period ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $1.6 million, compared to approximately $1.0 million for the comparable
period in 2015, an increase of approximately $0.6 million, or 60%. The increase in research and development costs was primarily
associated with increases in external research and development expenses related to the support of our ProNeura product development
programs, employee related expenses and other research and development expenses. These increases were partially offset by the reimbursement
by our development partner, Braeburn, of approximately $0.4 million of expenses related to Probuphine. Research and development
expenses for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $4.0 million, compared to approximately $3.5 million
for the comparable period in 2015, an increase of approximately $0.5 million, or 14%. The increase in research and development
costs reflects increases in external research and development expenses related to the support of our ProNeura product development
programs, employee related expenses and other research and development expenses. These increases were partially offset by the reimbursement
by our development partner, Braeburn, of approximately $1.1 million of expenses related to Probuphine. During the three and nine
month periods ended September 30, 2016, external research and development expenses relating to our product development programs
were approximately $1.1 million and $2.5 million, respectively, compared to approximately $0.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively,
for the comparable periods in 2015. Other research and development expenses include internal operating costs such as clinical research
and development personnel-related expenses, clinical trials related travel expenses, and allocation of facility and corporate costs.
As a result of the risks and uncertainties inherently associated with pharmaceutical research and development activities described
elsewhere in this report, we are unable to estimate the specific timing and future costs of our research and development programs
or the timing of material cash inflows, if any, from our product candidates. 

General and administrative expenses for
the three month period ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $1.1 million, compared to approximately $0.8 million for the
comparable period in 2015, an increase of approximately $0.3 million, or 38%. The increase in general and administrative expenses
during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 was primarily related to increases in non-cash stock compensation and employee
related costs of approximately $0.1 million and professional fees of approximately $0.2 million. General and administrative expenses
for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $3.4 million, compared to approximately $2.6 million for
the comparable period in 2015, an increase of approximately $0.8 million, or 31%. The increase in general and administrative expenses
during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was primarily related to a contractual fee obligation in connection with
payments received under the Probuphine license of approximately $0.2 million, increases in non-cash stock compensation and employee
related costs of approximately $0.3 million and professional fees of approximately $0.3 million. 

Net other expenses for the three and nine
month periods ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $4,000 and approximately $0.1 million, respectively. Net other expenses
for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015 were approximately $5,000 and $4.5 million, respectively. Net other
expense consisted primarily of non-cash losses on changes in the fair value of warrants. 

Our net loss for the three month period
ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $2.6 million, or approximately $0.12 per share, compared to approximately $1.8 million,
or approximately $0.09 per share, for the comparable period in 2015. Our net income for the nine month period ended September 30,
2016 was approximately $7.5 million, or approximately $0.36 per share, compared to our net loss of approximately $9.0 million,
or approximately $0.45 per share, for the comparable period in 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources    

We have funded our operations since inception
primarily through the sale of our securities, as well as with proceeds from warrant and option exercises, technology licensing,
collaborative agreements and government-sponsored research grants. At September 30, 2016, we had working capital of approximately
$16.0 million compared to working capital of approximately $7.4 million at December 31, 2015. 

Our operating activities provided approximately
$8.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This consisted primarily of the net income for the period of approximately
$7.5 million, non-cash charges of approximately $0.8 million related to stock-based compensation, approximately $0.1 million related
to non-cash losses resulting from changes in the fair value of warrants and approximately $0.3 million related to depreciation
and amortization. Uses of cash in operating activities were primarily to fund product development programs and administrative expenses. 

Our investing activities used approximately
$0.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which was primarily related to purchases of equipment. 

Our financing activities provided approximately
$27,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which was primarily related to exercises of stock options. 

In May 2016, the FDA approved our NDA and
pursuant to our license agreement with Braeburn, as amended to date, we received a $15 million milestone payment. 

At September 30, 2016, we had cash of approximately
$16.5 million, which we believe is sufficient to fund our planned operations into early 2018. We will require additional funds,
either through payments from Braeburn under the license agreement or through other financing arrangements, to advance our current
ProNeura development programs to later stage clinical studies and to complete the regulatory approval process necessary to commercialize
any products we might develop. In September 2016, we entered into an agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald   Co. to enable us to
sell up to $20 million of shares in an at-the-market offering (the  ATM ). To date, we have elected not to sell any
shares pursuant to the ATM given our current financial position and the market price of our stock.

Market Risk   

Our market risk disclosures set forth in
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 have not changed materially.
