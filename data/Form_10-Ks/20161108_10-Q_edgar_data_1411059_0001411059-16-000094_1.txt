1.  
    ORGANIZATION 
     KBS Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc. (the  Company ) was formed on July 12, 2007 as a Maryland corporation that elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2008.  The Company conducts its business primarily through KBS Limited Partnership II, a Delaware limited partnership formed on August 23, 2007 (the  Operating Partnership ), and its subsidiaries.  The Company is the sole general partner of and directly owns a   0.1%   partnership interest in the Operating Partnership.  The Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, KBS REIT Holdings II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company formed on August 23, 2007 ( KBS REIT Holdings II ), owns the remaining   99.9%   partnership interest in the Operating Partnership and is its sole limited partner.   
  The Company invested in a diverse portfolio of real estate and real estate-related investments.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned   11   real estate properties (consisting of   10   office properties and an office campus consisting of   eight   office buildings) and   one   real estate loan receivable.   
  Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, the business of the Company is managed by KBS Capital Advisors LLC (the  Advisor ), an affiliate of the Company, pursuant to an advisory agreement the Company renewed with the Advisor on May 21, 2016 (the  Advisory Agreement ).  The Advisory Agreement may be renewed for an unlimited number of   one  -year periods upon the mutual consent of the Advisor and the Company.  Either party may terminate the Advisory Agreement upon   60   days  written notice.  The Advisor owns   20,000   shares of the Company s common stock.   
  Upon commencing its initial public offering (the  Offering ), the Company retained KBS Capital Markets Group LLC (the  Dealer Manager ), an affiliate of the Advisor, to serve as the dealer manager of the Offering pursuant to a dealer manager agreement, as amended and restated on April 30, 2010 (the  Dealer Manager Agreement ).  The Company ceased offering shares of common stock in its primary offering on December 31, 2010 and terminated its primary offering on March 22, 2011.  The Company terminated its dividend reinvestment plan effective May 29, 2014.   
  The Company sold   182,681,633   shares of common stock in its primary offering for gross offering proceeds of   $1.8 billion  .  The Company sold   30,903,504   shares of common stock under its dividend reinvestment plan for gross offering proceeds of   $298.2 million  .  Also as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had redeemed   24,737,085   shares sold in the Offering for   $239.2 million  .   
   
           2.  
    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
     There have been no significant changes to the Company s accounting policies since it filed its audited financial statements in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  For further information about the Company s accounting policies, refer to the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended   December 31, 2015   included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ).   
  Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and condensed notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information as contained within the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) and the rules and regulations of the SEC, including the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, the unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for audited financial statements.  In the opinion of management, the financial statements for the unaudited interim periods presented include all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature, necessary for a fair and consistent presentation of the results for such periods.  Operating results for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.   
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, KBS REIT Holdings II, the Operating Partnership, and their direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements and condensed notes thereto in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and condensed notes.  Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. 
  Per Share Data 
  Basic net income (loss) per share of common stock is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding during such period.  Diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock equals basic net income (loss) per share of common stock as there were no potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.   
  Distributions declared per common share were   $0.070   and   $0.210   in the aggregate for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $0.074   and   $0.219   in the aggregate for   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  Distributions declared per common share assumes each share was issued and outstanding each day that was a record date for distributions and were based on a monthly record date for each month during the periods commencing January 2016 through   September 2016   and January 2015 through   September 2015  . 
  Segments 
  The Company invested in core real estate properties and real estate-related investments with the goal of acquiring a portfolio of income-producing investments.  The Company s real estate properties exhibit similar long-term financial performance and have similar economic characteristics to each other.  Beginning with the reporting period commencing on January 1, 2016, the Company aggregated its investments in real estate properties into   one   reportable business segment.  The Company considered both quantitative and qualitative thresholds and determined that its investment in a real estate loan receivable does not constitute a reportable segment.  Prior to the reporting period commencing on January 1, 2016, the Company had identified   two   reportable business segments based on its investment types: real estate and real estate-related.  However, based on the Company s current investment portfolio, the Company does not believe that its investment in a real estate-related investment is a reportable segment. 
  Square Footage, Occupancy and Other Measures 
   Any references to square footage, occupancy or annualized base rent are unaudited and outside the scope of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm s review of the Company s financial statements in accordance with the standards of the United States Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards Update 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   ( ASU No. 2014-09 ).  ASU No. 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize the revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.  ASU No. 2014-09 supersedes the revenue requirements in   Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)   and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification.  ASU No. 2014-09 does not apply to lease contracts within the scope of   Leases (Topic 840).    ASU No. 2014-09 was to be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, and is to be applied retrospectively, with early application not permitted.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date   ( ASU No. 2015-14 ), which defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 by one year.  Early adoption is permitted but not before the original effective date.  The Company is still evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2014-09 on its financial statements.

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements (Subtopic 205-40)  ,   Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern   ( ASU No. 2014-15 ).  The amendments in ASU No. 2014-15 require management to evaluate, for each annual and interim reporting period, whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or are available to be issued when applicable) and, if so, provide related disclosures.  ASU No. 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued.  The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2014-15 to have a significant impact on its financial statements. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ( ASU No. 2016-01 ).  The amendments in ASU No. 2016-01 address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.  ASU No. 2016-01 primarily affects accounting for equity investments and financial liabilities where the fair value option has been elected.  ASU No. 2016-01 also requires entities to present financial assets and financial liabilities separately, grouped by measurement category and form of financial asset in the balance sheet or in the accompanying notes to the financial statements.  ASU No. 2016-01 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early application is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued.  The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-01 to have a significant impact on its financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   ( ASU No. 2016-02 ).  The amendments in ASU No. 2016-02 change the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 as of its issuance is permitted.  The new leases standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new leases standard on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)   ( ASU No. 2016-13 ).  ASU No. 2016-13 affects entities holding financial assets and net investments in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income.  The amendments in ASU No. 2016-13 require a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.  The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset.  ASU No. 2016-13 also amends the impairment model for available-for-sale securities.  An entity will recognize an allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities as a contra-account to the amortized cost basis rather than as a direct reduction of the amortized cost basis of the investment, as is currently required.   ASU No. 2016-13 also requires new disclosures.  For financial assets measured at amortized cost, an entity will be required to disclose information about how it developed its allowance for credit losses, including changes in the factors that influenced management s estimate of expected credit losses and the reasons for those changes.  For financing receivables and net investments in leases measured at amortized cost, an entity will be required to further disaggregate the information it currently discloses about the credit quality of these assets by year of the asset s origination for as many as five annual periods. For available for sale securities, an entity will be required to provide a roll-forward of the allowance for credit losses and an aging analysis for securities that are past due.  ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company is still evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-13 on its financial statements, but does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 to have a material impact on its financial statements.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU No. 2016-15 ).  ASU No. 2016-15 is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows.  The amendments in ASU No. 2016-15 provide guidance on eight specific cash flow issues, including the following that are or may be relevant to the Company:  (a) Cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs should be classified as cash outflows for financing activities; (b) Cash payments relating to contingent consideration made soon after an acquisition s consummation date (i.e., approximately three months or less) should be classified as cash outflows for investing activities. Payments made thereafter should be classified as cash outflows for financing activities up to the amount of the original contingent consideration liability. Payments made in excess of the amount of the original contingent consideration liability should be classified as cash outflows for operating activities; (c) Cash payments received from the settlement of insurance claims should be classified on the basis of the nature of the loss (or each component loss, if an entity receives a lump-sum settlement); (d) In the absence of specific guidance, an entity should classify each separately identifiable cash source and use on the basis of the nature of the underlying cash flows. For cash flows with aspects of more than one class that cannot be separated, the classification should be based on the activity that is likely to be the predominant source or use of cash flow.  ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.  The Company is still evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-15 on its financial statements. 
   
           3.  
    REAL ESTATE  
     As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s portfolio of real estate was composed of   ten   office properties and an office campus consisting of   eight   office buildings, encompassing in the aggregate approximately   5.1 million   rentable square feet.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s real estate portfolio was   89%   occupied.  The following table summarizes the Company s real estate portfolio as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands):

As of   September 30, 2016  , the following properties represented more than 10% of the Company s total assets: 

_____________________ 
   (1)    Annualized base rent represents annualized contractual base rental income as of   September 30, 2016  , adjusted to straight-line any contractual tenant concessions (including free rent), rent increases and rent decreases from the lease s inception through the balance of the lease term. 
  Operating Leases 
  The Company s real estate properties are leased to tenants under operating leases for which the terms and expirations vary.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the leases had remaining terms, excluding options to extend, of up to   15.1   years with a weighted-average remaining term of   5.2   years.  Some of the leases have provisions to extend the term of the leases, options for early termination for all or part of the leased premises after paying a specified penalty, rights of first refusal to purchase the property at competitive market rates, and other terms and conditions as negotiated.  The Company retains substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the real estate assets leased to tenants.  Generally, upon the execution of a lease, the Company requires a security deposit from the tenant in the form of a cash deposit and/or a letter of credit.  The amount required as a security deposit varies depending upon the terms of the respective lease and the creditworthiness of the tenant, but generally is not a significant amount.  Therefore, exposure to credit risk exists to the extent that a receivable from a tenant exceeds the amount of its security deposit.  Security deposits received in cash related to tenant leases are included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and totaled   $2.5 million   and   $2.4 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recognized deferred rent from tenants, net of lease incentive amortization, of   $5.1 million   and   $3.9 million  , respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the cumulative deferred rent balance was   $59.0 million   and   $52.3 million  , respectively, and is included in rents and other receivables on the accompanying balance sheets.  The cumulative deferred rent balance included   $11.6 million   and   $11.9 million   of unamortized lease incentives as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.   
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the future minimum rental income from the Company s properties under non-cancelable operating leases was as follows (in thousands):

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had over   250   tenants over a diverse range of industries and geographic areas.  The Company s highest tenant industry concentrations (greater than 10% of annualized base rent) were as follows:

  No other tenant industries accounted for more than 10% of annualized base rent.  The Company had not identified any material tenant credit issues as of   September 30, 2016  .  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recorded bad debt expense of   $0.2 million   and   $0.1 million  , respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a bad debt expense reserve of approximately   $0.5 million  , which represented less than   1%   of its annualized base rent.   
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a concentration of credit risk related to the following tenant lease that represented more than 10% of the Company s annualized base rent:

   (1)    Annualized base rent represents annualized contractual base rental income as of   September 30, 2016  , adjusted to straight-line any contractual tenant concessions (including free rent), rent increases and rent decreases from the lease s inception through the balance of the lease term. 
   (2)    Represents the expiration date of the lease as of   September 30, 2016   and does not take into account any tenant renewal or termination options. 
   (3)    Of the   408,260   rentable square feet occupied by the tenant, a total of   33,602   rentable square feet expired on September 30, 2016 and   31,946   rentable square feet will expire on April 30, 2017. 
  No other tenant accounted for more than 10% of annualized base rent. 
  Geographic Concentration Risk 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s net investments in real estate in California and New Jersey represented   33.7%   and   21.7%   of the Company s total assets, respectively.  As a result, the geographic concentration of the Company s portfolio makes it particularly susceptible to adverse economic developments in the California and New Jersey real estate markets.  Any adverse economic or real estate developments in these markets, such as business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, relocations of businesses, changing demographics and other factors, or any decrease in demand for office space resulting from the local business climate, could adversely affect the Company s operating results and its ability to make distributions to stockholders.

Impairment of Real Estate 
  During the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of   $18.6 million   and   $23.1 million  , respectively, including an impairment charge of   $18.6 million   to write-down the carrying value of the 100   200 Campus Drive Buildings, an office property located in Florham Park, New Jersey, to its estimated fair value as a result of changes in cash flow estimates.  The decrease in cash flow projections was primarily due to (i) the lack of demand in the Florham Park office rental market resulting in slower rent growth and longer lease up periods and (ii) an increase in projected vacancy related to a tenant occupying   199,024   rentable square feet, or approximately   34%   of the 100   200 Campus Drive Buildings.  This tenant s lease expires in November 2016.  The Company no longer expected the tenant to renew its lease and is currently concentrating its efforts to re-leasing the vacated space.  As a result, the Company revised its cash flow projections for longer lease up periods and additional tenant improvement costs and leasing concessions required to attract new tenants.   
  In addition, during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded impairment charges of   $4.5 million   with respect to   two   real estate properties that were reclassified from held for sale to held for investment.  The impairment charges were recorded to adjust the carrying values of the properties for any depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recognized if the properties had always been classified as held for investment, which otherwise would have been recorded through depreciation and amortization expense.  
  The Company did not recognize any impairment charges during the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

 _____________________ 
   (1)    Contractual interest rate represents the interest rate in effect under the loan as of   September 30, 2016  .  Effective interest rate is calculated as the actual interest rate in effect as of   September 30, 2016   (consisting of the contractual interest rate and the effect of interest rate swaps and contractual floor rates, if applicable), using interest rate indices as of   September 30, 2016  , where applicable.  For further information regarding the Company s derivative instruments, see Note 8,  Derivative Instruments.  
   (2)    Represents the initial maturity date or the maturity date as extended as of   September 30, 2016  ; subject to certain conditions, the maturity dates of certain loans may be extended beyond the maturity date shown.  
   (3)    As of   September 30, 2016  , the Amended and Restated Portfolio Revolving Loan Facility was secured by Pierre Laclede Center.

    DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS 
     The Company enters into derivative instruments for risk management purposes to hedge its exposure to cash flow variability caused by changing interest rates.  The primary goal of the Company s risk management practices related to interest rate risk is to prevent changes in interest rates from adversely impacting the Company s ability to achieve its investment return objectives.  The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes. 
  The Company enters into interest rate swaps as a fixed rate payer to mitigate its exposure to rising interest rates on its variable rate notes payable.  The value of interest rate swaps is primarily impacted by interest rates, market expectations about interest rates, and the remaining life of the instrument.  In general, increases in interest rates, or anticipated increases in interest rates, will increase the value of the fixed rate payer position and decrease the value of the variable rate payer position.  As the remaining life of the interest rate swap decreases, the value of both positions will generally move towards zero.  
  The following table summarizes the notional amount and other information related to the Company s interest rate swaps as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  The notional amount is an indication of the extent of the Company s involvement in each instrument at that time, but does not represent exposure to credit, interest rate or market risks (dollars in thousands):   
   
 _____________________ 
   (1)    During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   two   of the Company s interest rate swaps expired and the Company partially terminated another interest rate swap agreement and paid a breakage fee of   $0.2 million  .  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , none of the Company s interest rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedges. 
  The following table sets forth the fair value of the Company s derivative instruments as well as their classification on the consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands):

The change in fair value of the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as a cash flow hedge is recorded as other comprehensive income (loss) in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and as other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated statements of stockholders  equity.  Amounts in other comprehensive income (loss) will be reclassified into earnings in the periods in which earnings are affected by the hedged cash flow.  The change in fair value of the ineffective portion is recognized directly in earnings.  With respect to swap agreements that were terminated for which it remains probable that the original hedged forecasted transactions (i.e., LIBOR-based debt service payments) will occur, the loss related to the termination of these swap agreements is included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is reclassified into earnings over the period of the original forecasted hedged transaction.  The change in fair value of a derivative instrument that is not designated as a cash flow hedge is recorded as interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  The following table summarizes the effects of derivative instruments on the Company s consolidated statements of operations (in thousands): 

_____________________ 
   (1)    All of the Company s interest rate swap agreements were initially designated as cash flow hedges.  During 2014, the Company dedesignated all of its interest rate swap instruments due to the anticipated early repayment of debt in connection with asset sales, and therefore, certain hedged forecasted transactions were no longer probable beyond the projected asset sale date.   
   
           9.  
    FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES 
     Under GAAP, the Company is required to measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis.  In addition, the Company is required to measure other non-financial and financial assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis (e.g., carrying value of impaired real estate loans receivable and long-lived assets).  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  The GAAP fair value framework uses a three-tiered approach.  Fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:   
             
    Level 1: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities;   
                
    Level 2: quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and   
                
    Level 3: prices or valuation techniques where little or no market data is available that requires inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.

The fair value for certain financial instruments is derived using a combination of market quotes, pricing models and other valuation techniques that involve significant management judgment.  The price transparency of financial instruments is a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of the Company s financial instruments.  Financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available and for which markets contain orderly transactions will generally have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments for which markets are inactive or consist of non-orderly trades.  The Company evaluates several factors when determining if a market is inactive or when market transactions are not orderly.  The following is a summary of the methods and assumptions used by management in estimating the fair value of each class of assets and liabilities for which it is practicable to estimate the fair value: 
  Cash and cash equivalents, rent and other receivables, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities:    These balances approximate their fair values due to the short maturities of these items. 
  Real estate loan receivable:   The Company s real estate loan receivable is presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at its amortized cost net of recorded loan loss reserves (if applicable) and not at fair value.  The fair value of the real estate loan receivable was estimated using an internal valuation model that considered the expected cash flows for the loan, underlying collateral value (for collateral-dependent loans) and estimated yield requirements of institutional investors for loans with similar characteristics, including remaining loan term, loan-to-value, type of collateral and other credit enhancements.  The Company classifies these inputs as Level 3 inputs. 
  Derivative instruments:   The Company s derivative instruments are presented at fair value on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  The valuation of these instruments is determined using a proprietary model that utilizes observable inputs.  As such, the Company classifies these inputs as Level 2 inputs.  The proprietary model uses the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, as well as observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and volatility.  The fair values of interest rate swaps are estimated using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts.  The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves.  In addition, credit valuation adjustments, which consider the impact of any credit risks to the contracts, are incorporated in the fair values to account for potential nonperformance risk. 
  Notes payable:   The fair value of the Company s notes payable is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on management s estimates of current market interest rates for instruments with similar characteristics, including remaining loan term, loan-to-value ratio, type of collateral and other credit enhancements.  Additionally, when determining the fair value of liabilities in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability is not available, the Company measures fair value using (i) a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or quoted prices for similar liabilities when traded as assets or (ii) another valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of fair value measurement, such as the income approach or the market approach.  The Company classifies these inputs as Level 3 inputs. 
  The following were the face values, carrying amounts and fair values of the Company s real estate loan receivable and notes payable as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , which carrying amounts do not generally approximate the fair values (in thousands):

Disclosure of the fair values of financial instruments is based on pertinent information available to the Company as of the period end and requires a significant amount of judgment.  Low levels of transaction volume for certain financial instruments have made the estimation of fair values difficult and, therefore, both the actual results and the Company s estimate of value at a future date could be materially different.

    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
     The Company has entered into the Advisory Agreement with the Advisor.  This agreement entitles the Advisor to specified fees upon the provision of certain services with regard to the management of the Company s investments, among other services, and the disposition of investments, as well as reimbursement of  certain costs incurred by the Advisor in providing services to the Company.  In addition, the Advisor is entitled to certain other fees, including an incentive fee upon achieving certain performance goals, as detailed in the Advisory Agreement.  The Company has also entered into a fee reimbursement agreement with the Dealer Manager pursuant to which the Company agreed to reimburse the Dealer Manager for certain fees and expenses it incurs for administering the Company s participation in the Depository Trust   Clearing Corporation Alternative Investment Product Platform with respect to certain accounts of the Company s investors serviced through the platform.  The Advisor and Dealer Manager also serve as the advisor and dealer manager, respectively, for KBS Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc., KBS Real Estate Investment Trust III, Inc., KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT, Inc., KBS Legacy Partners Apartment REIT, Inc., KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II, Inc. and KBS Growth   Income REIT, Inc. 
  On January 6, 2014, the Company, together with KBS Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc., KBS Real Estate Investment Trust III, Inc., KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT, Inc., KBS Legacy Partners Apartment REIT, Inc., KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II, Inc., the Dealer Manager, the Advisor and other KBS-affiliated entities, entered into an errors and omissions and directors and officers liability insurance program where the lower tiers of such insurance coverage are shared.  The cost of these lower tiers is allocated by the Advisor and its insurance broker among each of the various entities covered by the program, and is billed directly to each entity.  The allocation of these shared coverage costs is proportionate to the pricing by the insurance marketplace for the first tiers of directors and officers liability coverage purchased individually by each REIT.  The Advisor s and the Dealer Manager s portion of the shared lower tiers  cost is proportionate to the respective entities  prior cost for the errors and omissions insurance.  In June 2015, KBS Growth   Income REIT, Inc. was added to the insurance program at terms similar to those described above.  The insurance program was renewed and is effective through June 30, 2017. 
  During the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , no other business transactions occurred between the Company and KBS Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc., KBS Real Estate Investment Trust III, Inc., KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT, Inc., KBS Legacy Partners Apartment REIT, Inc., KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II, Inc. and KBS Growth   Income REIT, Inc.

The Company will not reimburse for employee costs in connection with services for which the Advisor earns acquisition, origination or disposition fees (other than reimbursement of travel and communication expenses) or for the salaries or benefits the Advisor or its affiliates may pay to the Company s executive officers.  In addition to the amounts above, the Company reimburses the Advisor for certain of the Company s direct costs incurred from third parties that were initially paid by the Advisor on behalf of the Company. 
   (2)    Disposition fees with respect to real estate sold are included in the gain on sale of real estate, net, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  Disposition fees with respect to real estate loans receivable sold are included in the gain on payoff or sale of real estate loans receivable in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

  Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements of KBS Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc. and the notes thereto.  As used herein, the terms  we,   our  and  us  refer to KBS Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and, as required by context, KBS Limited Partnership II, a Delaware limited partnership, which we refer to as the  Operating Partnership,  and to their subsidiaries.   
  Forward-Looking Statements 
  Certain statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements.  Those statements include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of KBS Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc. and members of our management team, as well as the assumptions on which such statements are based, and generally are identified by the use of words such as  may,   will,   seeks,   anticipates,   believes,   estimates,   expects,   plans,   intends,   should  or similar expressions.  Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements.  Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results over time, unless required by law.   
  The following are some of the risks and uncertainties, although not all of the risks and uncertainties, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements:   
             
    All of our executive officers and some of our directors and other key real estate and debt finance professionals are also officers, directors, managers, key professionals and/or holders of a direct or indirect controlling interest in our advisor, the entity that acted as our dealer manager and/or other KBS-affiliated entities.  As a result, they face conflicts of interest, including significant conflicts created by our advisor s compensation arrangements with us and other KBS-sponsored programs and KBS-advised investors and conflicts in allocating time among us and these other programs and investors.  These conflicts could result in unanticipated actions. 
                
    We pay substantial fees to and expenses of our advisor and its affiliates.  These payments increase the risk that our stockholders will not earn a profit on their investment in us and increase the risk of loss to our stockholders.  
                
    We have used proceeds from financings, when necessary, to fund a portion of our distributions during our operational stage.  We currently expect that our distributions will generally be paid from cash flow from operations and funds from operations from current or prior periods.  We also expect to fund other distributions from the net proceeds from the sale of real estate and from the receipt of principal payments from, or the sale of, our real estate-related loan receivable.  We can give no assurance regarding the timing, amount or source of future distributions. 
                
    We depend on tenants for the revenue generated by our real estate investments and, accordingly, the revenue generated by our real estate investments is dependent upon the success and economic viability of our tenants. Revenues from our properties could decrease due to a reduction in occupancy (caused by factors including, but not limited to, tenant defaults, tenant insolvency, early termination of tenant leases and non-renewal of existing tenant leases) and/or lower rental rates, making it more difficult for us to meet our debt service obligations and limiting our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. 
                
    Our investments in real estate and our mortgage loan may be affected by unfavorable real estate market and general economic conditions, which could decrease the value of those assets and reduce the investment return to our stockholders.  Revenues from our properties and the property and other assets directly securing our loan investment could decrease.  Such events would make it more difficult for the borrower under our loan investment to meet its payment obligations to us.  It could also make it more difficult for us to meet our debt service obligations and limit our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders.   
                
    Disruptions in the financial markets and uncertain economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy and generate returns to our stockholders.  
                
    Certain of our debt obligations have variable interest rates and related payments that vary with the movement of LIBOR or other indexes.  Increases in these indexes could increase the amount of our debt payments and limit our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders.   
                
    Our share redemption program provides only for redemptions sought upon a stockholder s death,  qualifying disability  or  determination of incompetence  (each as defined in the share redemption program document, and, together with redemptions sought in connection with a stockholder s death,  special redemptions ).  The dollar amounts available for such redemptions are determined by the board of directors and may be reviewed and adjusted from time to time.  Additionally, redemptions are further subject to limitations described in our share redemption program.  We currently do not expect to have funds available for ordinary redemptions in the future.

  Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Since we have terminated our dividend reinvestment plan, we may have to use a greater proportion of our cash flow from operations to meet cash requirements for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, capital expenditures, tenant improvement costs and leasing costs related to our real estate properties; reserves required by financings of our real estate properties; the repayment of debt; and special redemptions under our share redemption program.  This may reduce cash available for distributions. 
                
    During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we disposed one office/flex property.  During the year ended   December 31, 2015  , we sold one office property and received the repayment of one of our real estate loans receivable, and during the year ended December 31, 2014, we sold 15 real estate properties and received the repayment of three of our real estate loans receivable.  As a result of our disposition activity, our general and administrative expenses, which are not directly related to the size of our portfolio, have increased significantly as a percentage of our cash flow from operations and will continue to increase to the extent we sell additional assets. 
                
    Although the Special Committee (defined below) has engaged a financial advisor to assist with the exploration of strategic alternatives for us, we are not obligated to enter into any particular transaction or any transaction at all.  Further, although we have begun the process of exploring strategic alternatives and are marketing some of our assets for sale, there is no assurance that this process will result in stockholder liquidity, or provide a return to stockholders that equals or exceeds our estimated value per share.  We do not expect to provide additional updates regarding our review of strategic alternatives until such time, if any, that we are prepared to announce a material transaction or to conclude the strategic review.  
     All forward-looking statements should be read in light of the risks identified in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and in Part II, Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016, both as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ).   
  Overview 
  We were formed on July 12, 2007 as a Maryland corporation that elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2008 and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner.  We conduct our business primarily through our Operating Partnership, of which we are the sole general partner.  Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, our business is managed by our advisor, KBS Capital Advisors LLC, pursuant to an advisory agreement.  KBS Capital Advisors conducts our operations and manages our portfolio of real estate and real estate-related investments.  Our advisor owns 20,000 shares of our common stock.  We have no paid employees.   
  We invested in a diverse portfolio of real estate and real estate-related investments.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   11   real estate properties (consisting of   10   office properties and an office campus consisting of   eight   office buildings) and   one   real estate loan receivable.  
  On September 27, 2007, we filed a registration statement on Form S-11 with the SEC to offer a maximum of 280,000,000 shares of common stock for sale to the public, of which 200,000,000 shares were registered in our primary offering and 80,000,000 shares were registered under our dividend reinvestment plan.  We ceased offering shares of common stock in our primary offering on December 31, 2010.  We sold   182,681,633   shares of common stock in our primary offering for gross offering proceeds of $1.8 billion.  We terminated the offering under our dividend reinvestment plan effective May 29, 2014.  We sold   30,903,504   shares of common stock under our dividend reinvestment plan for gross offering proceeds of   $298.2 million  .  Also as of   September 30, 2016  , we had redeemed   24,737,085   shares sold in our offering for   $239.2 million  .   
  Our focus in 2016 is to: continue to strategically sell assets and potentially make a special distribution to stockholders; strategically negotiate lease renewals or new leases that facilitate the sales process and enhance property stability for prospective buyers; and complete major capital improvement projects, such as renovations or amenity enhancements, with the goal of attracting a greater pool of quality buyers.  On January 27, 2016, our board of directors formed a special committee (the  Special Committee ) composed of all of our independent directors to explore the availability of strategic alternatives involving us. As part of the process of exploring strategic alternatives, on February 23, 2016, the Special Committee engaged Evercore Group L.L.C. ( Evercore ) to act as our financial advisor and to assist the Special Committee with this process.  Under the terms of the engagement, Evercore will provide various financial advisory services, as requested by the Special Committee as customary for an engagement in connection with exploring strategic alternatives.  Although the Special Committee has engaged Evercore to assist us and the Special Committee with the exploration of strategic alternatives for us, we are not obligated to enter into any particular transaction or any transaction at all.

While the Special Committee continues to explore strategic alternatives for us, the Special Committee has determined that it would be in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders to market for sale our assets. Based on the results of this sales effort, the board of directors may conclude that it would be in our best interests and the best interests of our  stockholders to sell one or more of our assets, and, depending on the scope of the proposed asset sales, thereafter to adopt a plan of liquidation that would involve the sale of our remaining assets. In the event of such a determination, the proposed plan of liquidation would be presented to our stockholders for approval. Alternatively, based on the results of the initial sales effort, the board of directors may conclude that it would be in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders for us to engage in a limited number of asset sales and continue to operate as a going concern, but with a portfolio that is smaller than the present portfolio.  Although we have begun the process of exploring strategic alternatives and are marketing some of our assets for sale, there is no assurance that this process will result in stockholder liquidity, or provide a return to stockholders that equals or exceeds our estimated value per share.   
   
  Market Outlook   Real Estate and Real Estate Finance Markets 
  The following discussion is based on management s beliefs, observations and expectations with respect to the real estate and real estate finance markets. 
  Current conditions in the global capital markets remain volatile as we near the end of 2016.  Current economic data and financial market developments suggest that the global economy is improving, although at a slow incremental rate. Growth in most advanced economies remains lackluster, with low potential growth expectations now extending into 2017.  In this economic environment the central banks of the world s major economies hold sway over perceived investment opportunities.  Quantitative easing in Japan and the Eurozone has carried over into global capital markets and has increased demand for higher risk investments. 
  The initial reaction to the U.K. vote to leave the European Union has been somewhat muted, with the exception being the continued downward pressure on the Great Britain Pound ( GBP ).  As of mid-October 2016, the GBP had weakened in excess of 20 percent, year-to-date.  The new prime minister of the U.K. remains committed to carrying out the decoupling of the U.K. from the European Union.  The details of this process remain unclear, and the uncertainty has weighed on both the U.K. and European markets.  The European Central Bank has continued to pursue a policy of quantitative easing (QE). 
  In the United States, real GDP growth accelerated in the third quarter of 2016 to a 2.9% annual rate.  This is a marked improvement over the second quarter growth rate of 1.4%.  The strong third quarter number is tempered by the fact that a large portion of gross domestic product growth was seen in increased inventories, not through consumer demand.  Consumer confidence is currently at a 3 year low.  Corporate earnings are also an area of concern, as third quarter reported earnings growth showed a clear sign of slowing.  Federal Reserve Board communications have been signaling the increased likelihood of some firming of monetary policy.  Many economists expect an increase in rates to occur in early December.  The US government bond yield curve has seen a steady increase in yields and is currently no longer sitting at near record lows.   
  Europe and Japan continue to engage in unconventional monetary policy.  Asset purchases and stimulus programs in both regions have driven interest rates and investment yields to new lows.  Both regions now have historically low interest rates, with some government and corporate bonds trading with negative yields.  While the intent of these policies is to spur economic growth, the size of these programs is unprecedented, and the ultimate impact on those economies and the broader global financial system remains unclear.  
  The U.S. commercial real estate market continues to benefit from inflows of foreign capital, albeit at a slowing rate.  With the backdrop of global political conflict, and weaker international economic conditions, the U.S. dollar has remained a safe haven currency.  Lenders, however, have continued to cool to the market.  For balance sheet lenders, such as banks and insurance companies, underwriting standards for commercial real estate have been tightened.  This has resulted in lower loan-to-value and higher debt coverage ratios.  CMBS originations also have been limited as lenders are trying to adjust to the new securitization rules which require issuers to maintain an ongoing equity stake in pooled transactions.  These trends have led to increased uncertainty in the level and cost of debt for commercial properties, and in turn has injected some volatility into commercial real estate markets.

  PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONTINUED) 
  Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Impact on Our Real Estate Investments 
  The volatility in the global financial markets continues to cause a level of uncertainty in our outlook for the performance of the U.S. commercial real estate markets.  Both the investing and leasing environments are highly competitive.  While there has been an increase in the amount of capital flowing into U.S. real estate markets, the uncertainty regarding the economic environment has made businesses reluctant to make long-term commitments, as is evidenced by the lower level of business investment and capital expenditures.  Possible future declines in rental rates, slower or potentially negative net absorption of leased space and expectations of future rental concessions, including free rent to renew tenants early, to retain tenants who are up for renewal or to attract new tenants, may result in decreases in cash flows.  Historically low interest rates could help offset some of the impact of these potential decreases in operating cash flow for properties financed with variable rate mortgages; however, interest rates likely will not remain at these historically low levels for the remaining life of many of our investments. In fact, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates in the fourth quarter of 2015, and has left the door open for another increase at the end of 2016.  Currently we expect further increases in interest rates, but are uncertain as to the timing and levels.  Interest rates have become more volatile as the global capital markets react to increasing economic and geopolitical risks. 
  Impact on Our Real Estate-Related Investment 
  Our real estate loan receivable is directly secured by commercial real estate.  As a result, our real estate-related investment, in general, has been and likely will continue to be impacted by the same factors impacting our real estate properties. The higher yields and the improving credit position of many U.S. tenants and borrowers have attracted global capital.  However, the real estate and capital markets are fluid, and the positive trends can reverse quickly.  Economic conditions remain relatively volatile and can have a negative impact on the performance of collateral securing our loan investment, and therefore may impact the ability of the borrower under our loan to make contractual interest payments to us. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a fixed-rate real estate loan receivable with an outstanding principal balance of $14.1 million and a carrying value (including unamortized origination and closing costs) of $14.1 million that matures in 2018.  
  Impact on Our Financing Activities   
  In light of the risks associated with potentially volatile operating cash flows from some of our real estate properties, and the possible increase in the cost of financing due to higher interest rates, we may have difficulty refinancing some of our debt obligations prior to or at maturity or we may not be able to refinance these obligations at terms as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness.  Financial market conditions have improved from the bottom of the economic cycle, and short-term interest rates in the U.S. have increased.  Market conditions can change quickly, potentially negatively impacting the value of our investments. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had debt obligations in the aggregate principal amount of $524.7 million with a weighted-average remaining term of 1.4 years.  We had a total of $140.0 million of fixed rate notes payable and $384.7 million of variable rate notes payable as of   September 30, 2016  .  The interest rates on $106.6 million of our variable rate notes payable are effectively fixed through interest rate swap agreements.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a total of $384.7 million of debt obligations scheduled to mature within 12 months of that date.  We plan to exercise our extension options available under our loan agreements, if applicable, or pay down or refinance the related notes payable prior to their maturity dates.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our principal demands for funds during the short- and long-term are and will be for: the payment of operating expenses, capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses; payments under debt obligations; special redemptions of common stock pursuant to our share redemption program; and payments of distributions to stockholders.  
  We intend to use our cash on hand, cash flow generated by our real estate properties and real estate-related investment, proceeds from debt financing, proceeds from the sale of real estate properties and possibly the principal repayment on or sale of our real estate loan receivable as our primary sources of immediate and long-term liquidity.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had an aggregate of $41.0 million available for future disbursements under two credit facilities, subject to certain conditions and restrictions set forth in the respective loan agreements.  
  Our share redemption program provides only for special redemptions.  During each calendar year, such special redemptions are limited to an annual dollar amount determined by the board of directors, which may be reviewed during the year and increased or decreased upon ten business days  notice to our stockholders.  Special redemptions are made at a price per share equal to the most recent estimated value per share of our common stock as of the applicable redemption date.  We currently do not expect to make ordinary redemptions in the future.  On December 8, 2015, our board of directors approved an annual dollar limitation of $10.0 million in the aggregate for the calendar year 2016 (subject to review and adjustment during the year by the board of directors), and further subject to the limitations described in the share redemption program.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had $6.1 million available for special redemptions for the remainder of 2016.  
  Our investments in real estate generate cash flow in the form of rental revenues and tenant reimbursements, which are reduced by operating expenditures, debt service payments, the payment of asset management fees and corporate general and administrative expenses.  Cash flow from operations from our real estate investments is primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our portfolio, the net effective rental rates on our leases, the collectibility of rent and operating recoveries from our tenants and how well we manage our expenditures.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our real estate was   89%   occupied and our bad debt reserve was less than 1% of annualized base rent.   
  Our real estate-related investment generates cash flow in the form of interest income, which is reduced by the payment of asset management fees and corporate general and administrative expenses.  Cash flow from operations from our real estate-related investment is primarily dependent on the operating performance of the underlying collateral and the borrower s ability to make debt service payments.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the borrower under our real estate loan receivable was current on its debt service payments to us.  
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our cash needs for capital expenditures and the payment of debt obligations were met with the proceeds from the payoff or sale of real estate loans receivable and proceeds from the sales of real estate properties from prior periods.  Operating cash needs during the same period were met with cash flow generated by our real estate and real estate-related investments.  We made distributions to our stockholders during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   using cash flows from operations and cash on hand.  We believe that our cash on hand, cash flow from operations, availability under our credit facilities, proceeds from the sales of real estate properties and the repayment of or sale of our real estate loan receivable will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a total of $384.7 million of debt obligations scheduled to mature within 12 months of that date.  We plan to exercise our extension options available under our loan agreements, if applicable, or pay down or refinance the related notes payable prior to their maturity dates.  
  On December 8, 2015, our board of directors approved an estimated value per share of our common stock of $5.62 (unaudited) based on the estimated value of our assets less the estimated value of our liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding, all as of September 30, 2015.  For a full description of the assumptions, methodologies and limitations used to value our assets and liabilities in connection with the calculation of our estimated value per share, see our Current Report on Form 8-K dated December 8, 2015 and filed with the SEC on December 9, 2015. 
  Our cash flow from operations has decreased and will continue to decrease as a result of our disposition activity, and we have adjusted our distribution policy with respect to the amount of monthly distribution payments to take into account our disposition activity and current real estate investments. We may continue to make strategic asset sales as opportunities become available in the market. Any future special distributions we make from the proceeds of future dispositions will reduce our estimated value per share and this reduction will be reflected in our updated estimated value per share, which we expect to update no later than December 2016.

On January 27, 2016, our board of directors formed the Special Committee, which is composed of all of our independent directors, to explore the availability of strategic alternatives involving us. As part of the process of exploring strategic alternatives, on February 23, 2016, the Special Committee engaged Evercore to act as our financial advisor and to assist the Special Committee with this process.  Under the terms of the engagement, Evercore will provide various financial advisory services, as requested by the Special Committee as customary for an engagement in connection with exploring strategic alternatives.  Although the Special Committee has engaged Evercore to assist us and the Special Committee with the exploration of strategic alternatives for us, we are not obligated to enter into any particular transaction or any transaction at all.   
  While the Special Committee continues to explore strategic alternatives for us, the Special Committee has determined that it would be in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders to market for sale our assets. Based on the results of this sales effort, the board of directors may conclude that it would be in our best interests and the best interests of our  stockholders to sell one or more of our assets, and, depending on the scope of the proposed asset sales, thereafter to adopt a plan of liquidation that would involve the sale of our remaining assets. In the event of such a determination, the proposed plan of liquidation would be presented to our stockholders for approval. Alternatively, based on the results of the initial sales effort, the board of directors may conclude that it would be in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders for us to engage in a limited number of asset sales and continue to operate as a going concern, but with a portfolio that is smaller than the present portfolio.  Although we have begun the process of exploring strategic alternatives and are marketing some of our assets for sale, there is no assurance that this process will result in stockholder liquidity, or provide a return to stockholders that equals or exceeds our estimated value per share.   
  Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   11   real estate properties (consisting of   10   office properties and an office campus consisting of   eight   office buildings) and one real estate loan receivable.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , net cash provided by operating activities was   $44.6 million  , compared to   $36.3 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the timing of lease commission payments.  We anticipate cash flows from operating activities to decrease to the extent we make additional asset sales.  
  Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
  Net cash provided by investing activities was   $9.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and primarily consisted of the following: 
             
    $41.2 million of proceeds from the sale of one office/flex property; and 
                
    $32.1 million used for improvements to real estate. 
     Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
    During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , net cash used in financing activities was   $67.7 million   and consisted primarily of the following: 
              
    $39.8 million of principal payments on notes payable;  
                
    $17.0 million of proceeds from note payable; and 
                
    $3.9 million of cash used for redemptions of common stock.

In addition to using our capital resources to meet our debt service obligations, for capital expenditures and for operating costs, we use our capital resources to make certain payments to our advisor.  We paid our advisor fees in connection with the acquisition and origination of our assets and pay our advisor fees in connection with the management and disposition of our assets and for certain costs incurred by our advisor in providing services to us.  Among the fees payable to our advisor is an asset management fee.  With respect to investments in real estate, we pay our advisor a monthly asset management fee equal to one-twelfth of 0.75% of the amount paid or allocated to acquire the investment, plus the cost of any subsequent development, construction or improvements to the property.  This amount includes any portion of the investment that was debt financed and is inclusive of acquisition fees and expenses related thereto.  With respect to investments in loans and any investments other than real estate, we pay our advisor a monthly asset management fee calculated, each month, as one-twelfth of 0.75% of the lesser of (i) the amount paid or allocated to acquire or fund the loan or other investment (which amount includes any portion of the investment that was debt financed and is inclusive of acquisition or origination fees and expenses related thereto) and (ii) the outstanding principal amount of such loan or other investment, plus the acquisition or origination fees and expenses related to the acquisition or funding of such investment, as of the time of calculation.  We also continue to reimburse our advisor and our dealer manager for certain stockholder services. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $58.8 million   of cash and cash equivalents and up to $41.0 million available for future disbursements under two credit facilities, subject to certain conditions and restrictions set forth in the respective loan agreements, to meet our operational and capital needs. 
  In order to execute our investment strategy, we primarily utilized secured debt to finance a portion of our investment portfolio.  Management remains vigilant in monitoring the risks inherent with the use of debt in our portfolio and is taking actions to ensure that these risks, including refinance and interest rate risks, are properly balanced with the benefit of using leverage.  We limit our total liabilities to 75% of the cost (before deducting depreciation or other noncash reserves) of our tangible assets; however, we may exceed that limit if the majority of the conflicts committee approves each borrowing in excess of such limitation and we disclose such borrowings to our stockholders in our next quarterly report with an explanation from the conflicts committee of the justification for the excess borrowing.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our borrowings and other liabilities were approximately   35%   of both the cost (before deducting depreciation or other noncash reserves) and book value (before deducting depreciation) of our tangible assets, respectively.   
   
  Contractual Commitments and Contingencies 
  The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 
   
 _____________________ 
   (1)    Amounts include principal payments only.   
   (2)    Projected interest payments are based on the outstanding principal amounts, maturity dates and interest rates in effect as of   September 30, 2016   (consisting of the contractual interest rate and the effect of interest rate floors and swaps, if applicable).  We incurred interest expense of $11.4 million, excluding net unrealized gains on interest rate swap agreements of   $0.3 million  , swap termination expense of   $0.2 million   and amortization of deferred financing costs totaling   $1.4 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

Results of Operations 
  Overview 
  As of   September 30, 2015  , we owned 10 office properties, one office/flex property, an office campus consisting of eight office buildings and one real estate loan receivable.  Subsequent to   September 30, 2015  , we sold one office/flex property.  As a result, as of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   10   office properties, an office campus consisting of   eight   office buildings and   one   real estate loan receivable.  The results of operations presented for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are not directly comparable due to the disposition of two real estate properties and the repayment of one real estate loan receivable subsequent to January 1, 2015.  In general, we expect income and expenses to decrease in future periods due to disposition activity. 
  Comparison of the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   versus the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015 
  The following table provides summary information about our results of operations for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (dollar amounts in thousands): 
   
 _____________________ 
   (1)    Represents the dollar amount increase (decrease) for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   related to real estate and real estate-related investments disposed of on or after July 1, 2015.   
   (2)    Represents the dollar amount increase (decrease) for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   related to real estate and real estate-related investments owned by us throughout both periods presented.   
  Rental income and tenant reimbursements decreased from $37.6 million for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   to $36.6 million for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to the disposition of one office/flex property during the second quarter of 2016.  Overall, we expect rental income and tenant reimbursements to decrease in future periods due to the anticipated dispositions of real estate properties.  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , rental income and tenant reimbursements from our real estate property sold were $0 and $1.0 million, respectively.  
  Interest income from our real estate loans receivable, recognized using the interest method, decreased from   $1.5 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $0.3 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily as a result of the payoff of a real estate loan receivable in August 2015.  Interest income from real estate loans receivable in future periods compared to historical periods will decrease as a result of the anticipated payoff or sale of our real estate loan receivable.  
  Other operating income decreased from   $1.9 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $1.7 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   due to a decrease in parking revenues for properties held throughout both periods.  Overall, we expect other operating income to decrease in future periods due to anticipated dispositions of real estate properties.

Operating, maintenance and management costs increased from   $8.9 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $9.0 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The increase was primarily due to higher utility costs and general repair and maintenance costs for properties held throughout both periods, partially offset by a decrease in operating, maintenance and management costs due to the disposition of one office/flex property during the second quarter of 2016.  Operating, maintenance and management costs may increase in future periods, as compared to historical periods, as a result of inflation.  Overall, we expect operating, maintenance and management costs to decrease in future periods due to the anticipated dispositions of real estate properties.  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , operating, maintenance and management costs from our real estate property sold were $0 and $56,000, respectively.  
  Real estate taxes and insurance decreased from $5.2 million for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $5.1 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  This decrease was primarily due to the disposition of one office/flex property during the second quarter of 2016, partially offset by an increase in real estate taxes and insurance for properties held through both periods due to property tax reassessments.  We expect real estate taxes and insurance to decrease in future periods due to the anticipated dispositions of real estate properties.  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , real estate taxes and insurance from our real estate property sold were $0 and $0.1 million, respectively.  
  Asset management fees with respect to our real estate and real estate-related investments decreased slightly from   $3.0 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   to $2.9 million for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , due to the payoff of a real estate loan receivable in August 2015 and the disposition of one office/flex property during the second quarter of 2016.  All asset management fees incurred as of   September 30, 2016   have been paid.  We expect asset management fees to decrease in future periods due to anticipated asset sales or other dispositions.  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, asset management fees from our real estate and real estate-related investment sold or otherwise disposed of were $0 and $0.1 million, respectively.  
  Depreciation and amortization decreased from   $14.5 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $14.2 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to the disposition of one office/flex property during the second quarter of 2016.  We expect depreciation and amortization to decrease in future periods due to the anticipated dispositions of real estate properties and an overall decrease in amortization of tenant origination costs related to lease expirations.  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , depreciation and amortization from our real estate property sold were $0 and $0.3 million, respectively.  
  Interest expense decreased from   $5.5 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $4.1 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The decrease in interest expense is primarily due to an overall decrease in the average loan balance of our existing notes payable related to properties held throughout both periods.  Included in interest expense is the amortization of deferred financing costs of   $0.5 million   and   $0.6 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2016  , respectively.  During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recorded   $0.2 million   and   $0.6 million   of unrealized gains on interest rate swaps, respectively.  In general, we expect interest expense to decrease in future periods due to debt repayments related to assets sold and anticipated asset sales, which may be offset by certain fees and costs that may be incurred due to the prepayment of certain loans.  Our interest expense in future periods will also vary based on fluctuations in one-month LIBOR (for our variable rate debt, to the extent that such variable rate debt is not subject to an interest rate swap agreement) and our level of future borrowings, which will depend on the availability and cost of debt financing, draws on our credit facilities and any debt repayments we make.  In addition, our interest expense in future periods will vary based on fair value changes with respect to our interest rate swaps that are not accounted for as cash flow hedges.  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , interest expense from the loan secured by our real estate property sold was $0 and $0.2 million, respectively.  
  During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $18.6 million to write-down the carrying value of the 100   200 Campus Drive Buildings, an office property located in Florham Park, New Jersey, to its estimated fair value as a result of changes in cash flow estimates.  The decrease in cash flow projections was primarily due to (i) the lack of demand in the Florham Park office rental market resulting in slower rent growth and longer lease up periods and (ii) an increase in projected vacancy related to a tenant occupying 199,024 rentable square feet, or approximately 34% of the 100   200 Campus Drive Buildings.  This tenant s lease expires in November 2016.  We no longer expected the tenant to renew its lease.  As a result, we revised our cash flow projections for longer lease up periods and additional tenant improvement costs and leasing concessions required to attract new tenants.  We did not recognize any impairment charge during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

  The following table provides summary information about our results of operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (dollar amounts in thousands): 
   
 _____________________ 
   (1)    Represents the dollar amount increase (decrease) for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   related to real estate and real estate-related investments disposed of on or after January 1, 2015.   
   (2)    Represents the dollar amount increase (decrease) for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   related to real estate and real estate-related investments owned by us throughout both periods presented.   
  Rental income and tenant reimbursements decreased from $116.3 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to $112.8 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to the disposition of two real estate properties subsequent to January 1, 2015, partially offset by an increase in tenant reimbursements due to property tax and monthly operating expense recoveries from properties held throughout both periods.  Overall, we expect rental income and tenant reimbursements to decrease in future periods due to the anticipated dispositions of real estate properties.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , rental income and tenant reimbursements from our real estate properties sold were $1.4 million and $5.2 million, respectively.  
  Interest income from our real estate loans receivable, recognized using the interest method, decreased from   $4.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $0.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily as a result of the payoff of a real estate loan receivable in August 2015.  Interest income from real estate loans receivable in future periods compared to historical periods will decrease as a result of the anticipated payoff or sale of our real estate loan receivable.  
  Other operating income decreased from $5.6 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to $5.2 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to the disposition of two real estate properties subsequent to January 1, 2015 and a decrease in parking revenues for properties held throughout both periods.  Overall, we expect other operating income to decrease in future periods due to anticipated dispositions of real estate properties.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , other operating income from our real estate properties sold was $0 and $0.1 million, respectively.  
  Operating, maintenance and management costs decreased from   $27.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $25.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The decrease was primarily due to the disposition of two real estate properties subsequent to January 1, 2015 and a decrease in snow removal costs and utility costs for properties held throughout both periods.  Operating, maintenance and management costs may increase in future periods, as compared to historical periods, as a result of inflation.  Overall, we expect operating, maintenance and management costs to decrease in future periods due to the anticipated dispositions of real estate properties.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , operating, maintenance and management costs from our real estate properties sold were $35,000 and $0.7 million, respectively.

Real estate taxes and insurance decreased from   $15.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $15.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  This decrease was primarily due to the disposition of two real estate properties subsequent to January 1, 2015.  We expect real estate taxes and insurance to decrease in future periods due to the anticipated dispositions of real estate properties.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , real estate taxes and insurance from our real estate properties sold were $0.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively.  
  Asset management fees with respect to our real estate and real estate-related investments decreased from   $9.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $8.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , due to the disposition of two real estate properties and the payoff of a real estate loan receivable subsequent to January 1, 2015.  All asset management fees incurred as of   September 30, 2016   have been paid.  We expect asset management fees to decrease in future periods due to anticipated asset sales or other dispositions.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, asset management fees from our real estate and real estate-related investments sold or otherwise disposed of were $0.1 million and $0.6 million, respectively.  
  General and administrative expenses increased from   $3.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $5.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  This increase was primarily due to professional fees related to the Special Committee s engagement of Evercore to act as our financial advisor and legal fees related to the anticipated dispositions of our real estate properties.  See   Liquidity and Capital Resources  for our discussion on the engagement of Evercore. 
  Depreciation and amortization increased from   $42.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $43.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   due to the reclassification of two real estate properties from held for sale to held for investment, which resulted in a portion of the depreciation and amortization expense being classified as an impairment charge during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  This increase was offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization due to the disposition of two real estate properties subsequent to January 1, 2015.  We expect depreciation and amortization to decrease in future periods due to the anticipated dispositions of real estate properties and an overall decrease in amortization of tenant origination costs related to lease expirations.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , depreciation and amortization from our real estate properties sold were $0.4 million and $0.9 million, respectively.  
  Interest expense decreased from   $17.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $12.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The decrease in interest expense is primarily due to an overall decrease to our total debt outstanding due to loan repayments in connection with the disposition of two real estate properties subsequent to January 1, 2015, and an overall decrease in the average loan balance of our existing notes payable related to properties held throughout both periods.  Included in interest expense is the amortization of deferred financing costs of   $1.6 million   and   $1.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2016  , respectively.  Also included in interest expense during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were $0.2 million and $0.2 million of termination fees related to the payoff of loans secured by the real estate properties sold subsequent to January 1, 2015.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recorded   $0.3 million   and   $1.2 million   of unrealized gains on interest rate swaps, respectively.  In general, we expect interest expense to decrease in future periods due to debt repayments related to assets sold and anticipated asset sales, which may be offset by certain fees and costs that may be incurred due to the prepayment of certain loans.  Our interest expense in future periods will also vary based on fluctuations in one-month LIBOR (for our variable rate debt, to the extent that such variable rate debt is not subject to an interest rate swap agreement) and our level of future borrowings, which will depend on the availability and cost of debt financing, draws on our credit facilities and any debt repayments we make.  In addition, our interest expense in future periods will vary based on fair value changes with respect to our interest rate swaps that are not accounted for as cash flow hedges.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , interest expense from the loans secured by our real estate properties sold was $0.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively.   
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recorded non-cash impairment charges of   $23.1 million  , including an impairment charge of $18.6 million to write-down the carrying value of the 100   200 Campus Drive Buildings, an office property located in Florham Park, New Jersey, to its estimated fair value as a result of changes in cash flow estimates.  Please see     Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2016 versus the three months ended September 30, 2015  above for a discussion of the impairment charge related to the 100   200 Campus Drive Buildings.  In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $4.5 million with respect to two real estate properties that were reclassified from held for sale to held for investment.  The impairment charge was recorded to adjust the carrying values of the properties for any depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recognized if the properties had always been classified as held for investment, which otherwise would have been recorded through depreciation and amortization expense.  We did not recognize any impairment charge during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

We recognized a gain on sale of real estate of   $9.1 million   related to the disposition of one office/flex property during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recognized a gain on sale of real estate of   $27.4 million   related to the disposition of one office property. 
   
  Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations 
  We believe that funds from operations ( FFO ) is a beneficial indicator of the performance of an equity REIT.  We compute FFO in accordance with the current National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ) definition.  FFO represents net income, excluding gains and losses from sales of operating real estate assets (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates), impairment losses on real estate assets, depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  We believe FFO facilitates comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other REITs.  However, our computation of FFO may not be comparable to other REITs that do not define FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do.  Our management believes that historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time.  Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves.  As a result, we believe that the use of FFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provides a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our competitors and provides a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities. 
  Changes in accounting rules have resulted in a substantial increase in the number of non-operating and non-cash items included in the calculation of FFO.  As a result, our management also uses modified funds from operations ( MFFO ) as an indicator of our ongoing performance as well as our dividend sustainability.  MFFO excludes from FFO: acquisition fees and expenses; adjustments related to contingent purchase price obligations; amounts relating to straight-line rents and amortization of above and below market intangible lease assets and liabilities; accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; amortization of closing costs relating to debt investments; impairments of real estate-related investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income; and gains or losses included in net income for the extinguishment or sale of debt or hedges.  We compute MFFO in accordance with the definition of MFFO included in the practice guideline issued by the Investment Program Association ( IPA ) in November 2010 as interpreted by management.  Our computation of MFFO may not be comparable to other REITs that do not compute MFFO in accordance with the current IPA definition or that interpret the current IPA definition differently than we do.   
  We believe that MFFO is helpful as a measure of ongoing operating performance because it excludes non-operating items included in FFO.  MFFO excludes non-cash items such as straight-line rental revenue.  Additionally, we believe that MFFO provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the performance indicators and analysis used by management, in addition to net income and cash flows from operating activities as defined by GAAP, to evaluate the sustainability of our operating performance.  MFFO provides comparability in evaluating the operating performance of our portfolio with other non-traded REITs which typically have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies.  MFFO, or an equivalent measure, is routinely reported by non-traded REITs, and we believe often used by analysts and investors for comparison purposes. 
  FFO and MFFO are non-GAAP financial measures and do not represent net income as defined by GAAP.  Net income as defined by GAAP is the most relevant measure in determining our operating performance because FFO and MFFO include adjustments that investors may deem subjective, such as adding back expenses such as depreciation and amortization and the other items described above.  Accordingly, FFO and MFFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indicator of our current and historical operating performance.  In addition, FFO and MFFO do not represent cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered an indication of our liquidity.  We believe FFO and MFFO, in addition to net income and cash flows from operating activities as defined by GAAP, are meaningful supplemental performance measures; however, neither FFO nor MFFO reflect adjustments for the operations of properties and real estate-related investments sold or held for sale during the periods presented.  During periods of significant disposition activity, FFO and MFFO are much more limited measures of future performance and dividend sustainability.  In connection with our presentation of FFO and MFFO, we are providing information related to the proportion of MFFO related to properties sold and real estate-related investments sold or repaid as of   September 30, 2016  .

Although MFFO includes other adjustments, the exclusion of straight-line rent, the amortization of above- and below-market leases, the amortization of discounts and closing costs, termination fees on derivative instruments, unrealized gains on derivative instruments and prepayment fees related to the extinguishment of debt are the most significant adjustments for the periods presented.  We have excluded these items based on the following economic considerations: 
             
    Adjustments for straight-line rent.    These are adjustments to rental revenue as required by GAAP to recognize contractual lease payments on a straight-line basis over the life of the respective lease.  We have excluded these adjustments in our calculation of MFFO to more appropriately reflect the current economic impact of our in-place leases, while also providing investors with a useful supplemental metric that addresses core operating performance by removing rent we expect to receive in a future period or rent that was received in a prior period; 
                
    Amortization of above- and below-market leases.    Similar to depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and lease related costs that are excluded from FFO, GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of intangible lease assets and liabilities diminishes predictably over time and requires that these charges be recognized currently in revenue.  Since real estate values and market lease rates in the aggregate have historically risen or fallen with local market conditions, management believes that by excluding these charges, MFFO provides useful supplemental information on the realized economics of the real estate; 
                
    Amortization of discounts and closing costs.    Discounts and closing costs related to debt investments are amortized over the term of the loan as an adjustment to interest income.  This application results in income recognition that is different than the underlying contractual terms of the debt investments.  We have excluded the amortization of discounts and closing costs related to our debt investments in our calculation of MFFO to more appropriately reflect the economic impact of our debt investments, as discounts will not be economically recognized until the loan is repaid and closing costs are essentially the same as acquisition fees and expenses on real estate (discussed below).  We believe excluding these items provides investors with a useful supplemental metric that directly addresses core operating performance;  
                
    Termination fees on derivative instruments.   Termination fees on derivative instruments are included in interest expense.  Although these amounts reduce net income, we exclude them from MFFO to more appropriately reflect the ongoing impact of our interest rate swap agreements;  
                
    Unrealized gains on derivative instruments.    These adjustments include unrealized gains from mark-to-market adjustments on interest rate swaps and losses due to hedge ineffectiveness.  The change in fair value of interest rate swaps not designated as a hedge and the change in fair value of the ineffective portion of interest rate swaps are non-cash adjustments recognized directly in earnings and are included in interest expense.  We have excluded these adjustments in our calculation of MFFO to more appropriately reflect the economic impact of our interest rate swap agreements; and 
                
    Prepayment fees related to the extinguishment of debt.    Prepayment fees related to the extinguishment of debt are generally included in interest expense.  Although these amounts reduce net income, we exclude them from MFFO to more appropriately present the ongoing operating performance of our real estate investments on a comparative basis.

Our calculation of FFO, which we believe is consistent with the calculation of FFO as defined by NAREIT, is presented in the following table, along with our calculation of MFFO, for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively (in thousands).  No conclusions or comparisons should be made from the presentation of these periods.   

Our calculation of MFFO above includes amounts related to the operations of two real estate properties sold and one real estate loan receivable paid off between January 1, 2015 and   September 30, 2016  .  Please refer to the table below with respect to the proportion of MFFO related to the real estate properties sold and real estate-related investment paid off as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands). 

FFO and MFFO may also be used to fund all or a portion of certain capitalizable items that are excluded from FFO and MFFO, such as tenant improvements, building improvements and deferred leasing costs.

Distributions 
  Distributions declared, distributions paid and cash flow from operations were as follows for the first, second and third quarters of 2016 (in thousands, except per share amounts):   

_____________________ 
   (1)    Assumes each share was issued and outstanding each day that was a record date for distributions during the period presented.   
   (2)    Other than special distributions, distributions generally are paid on a monthly basis, on or about the first business day of the following month. 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we paid aggregate distributions of $40.2 million, all of which were paid in cash.  FFO and cash flow from operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were $51.6 million and $44.6 million, respectively.  We funded our total distributions paid with $37.9 million of current period cash flow from operations and $2.3 million of cash on hand.  For purposes of determining the source of our distributions paid, we assume first that we use cash flow from operations from the relevant periods to fund distribution payments.  See the reconciliation of FFO to net income above. 
  Over the long term, we expect that our distributions will generally be paid from cash flow from operations and FFO from current or prior periods (except with respect to distributions related to sales of our assets and distributions related to the repayment of principal under our mortgage loan investment). 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold one office/flex property.  During the year ended   December 31, 2015  , we sold one office property and received the repayment of one of our real estate loans receivable, and during the year ended December 31, 2014, we sold 15 real estate properties and received repayments of three of our real estate loans receivable. Our cash flow from operations has decreased and will continue to decrease as a result of our disposition activity, and we have adjusted our distribution policy with respect to the amount of monthly distribution payments to take into account our disposition activity and current real estate investments. We may continue to make strategic asset sales as opportunities become available in the market. Any future special distributions we make from the proceeds of future dispositions will reduce our estimated value per share and this reduction will be reflected in our updated estimated value per share, which we expect to update no later than December 2016. 
  Our operating performance and ability to pay distributions from our cash flow from operations and/or the disposition of our assets cannot be accurately predicted and may deteriorate in the future due to numerous factors, including those discussed under  Forward   Looking Statements,   Market Outlook   Real Estate and Real Estate Finance Markets,   Liquidity and Capital Resources  and  Results of Operations  herein and the risks discussed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and in Part II, Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016, both as filed with the SEC.  Those factors include: the future operating performance of our investments in the existing real estate and financial environment; the success and economic viability of our tenants; the ability of our borrower to continue to make debt service payments and/or to repay its loan upon maturity; our ability to refinance existing indebtedness at comparable terms; changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt obligations; our ability to successfully dispose of some of our assets; and the sources and amounts of cash we have available for distributions.

Critical Accounting Policies 
  Our consolidated interim financial statements and condensed notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the SEC.  The preparation of our financial statements requires significant management judgments, assumptions and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.  These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.  With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements.  Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses.  A discussion of the accounting policies that management considers critical in that they involve significant management judgments, assumptions and estimates is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the SEC.  There have been no significant changes to our policies during   2016  . 
   
  Subsequent Events 
  We evaluate subsequent events up until the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. 
  Distributions Paid 
  On October 3, 2016, we paid distributions of   $4.4 million  , which related to distributions declared for September 2016 in the amount of   $0.02303279   per share of common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 20, 2016.  On November 1, 2016, we paid distributions of   $4.5 million  , which related to distributions declared for October 2016 in the amount of   $0.02380055   per share of common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 20, 2016. 
  Distributions Declared  
  On November 7, 2016, our board of directors declared a November 2016 distribution in the amount of   $0.02303279   per share of common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 21, 2016, which we expect to pay in December 2016, and a December 2016 distribution in the amount of   $0.02380055   per share of common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 20, 2016, which we expect to pay in January 2017.

  Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

We are exposed to the effects of interest rate changes as a result of borrowings used to maintain liquidity, to fund the financing and refinancing of our real estate and real estate-related investment portfolio, and to fund our operations.  Our profitability and the value of our investment portfolio may be adversely affected during any period as a result of interest rate changes.  Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings, prepayment penalties and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs.  We have managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by maintaining a ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt such that variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level.  In addition, we may utilize a variety of financial instruments, including interest rate caps, floors, and swap agreements, in order to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operations.  When we use these types of derivatives to hedge the risk of interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities, we may be subject to certain risks, including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments of distributions to our stockholders and that the losses may exceed the amount we invested in the instruments. 
    We borrow funds and made real estate-related investments at a combination of fixed and variable rates.  Interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt or fixed rate real estate loan receivable unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated.  However, interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value and carrying value of our fixed rate real estate loan receivable were $14.3 million and   $14.1 million  , respectively.  The fair value estimate of our real estate loan receivable is calculated using an internal valuation model that considers the expected cash flows for the loan, underlying collateral value (for collateral-dependent loans) and the estimated yield requirements of institutional investors for loans with similar characteristics, including remaining loan term, loan-to-value, type of collateral and other credit enhancements.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of our fixed rate debt was $141.4 million and the outstanding principal balance of our fixed rate debt was   $140.0 million  .  The fair value estimate of our fixed rate debt is calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing rates we would expect to pay for debt of a similar type and remaining maturity if the loans were originated as of   September 30, 2016  .  With respect to our fixed rate instruments, we do not expect that fluctuations in interest rates, and the resulting change in fair value of our fixed rate instruments, would have a significant impact on our ongoing operations.   
  Conversely, movements in interest rates on our variable rate debt would change our future earnings and cash flows, but not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments.  However, changes in required risk premiums would result in changes in the fair value of variable rate instruments.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on   $278.1 million   of variable rate debt outstanding, after giving consideration to the impact of interest rate swap agreements on approximately   $106.6 million   of our variable rate debt.  Based on interest rates as of   September 30, 2016  , if interest rates were 100 basis points higher during the 12 months ending September 30, 2017, interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase by $2.8 million.  As of   September 30, 2016  , one-month LIBOR was 0.53111% and if this index was reduced to 0% during the 12 months ending September 30, 2017, interest expense on our variable rate debt would decrease by $1.5 million.   
  The annual effective interest rate of our fixed rate real estate loan receivable as of   September 30, 2016   was 7.6%.  The annual effective interest rate represents the effective interest rate as of   September 30, 2016  , using the interest method, which we use to recognize interest income on our real estate loan receivable.  The weighted-average interest rates of our fixed rate debt and variable rate debt as of   September 30, 2016   were 3.5% and 2.6%, respectively.  The weighted-average interest rate represents the actual interest rate in effect as of   September 30, 2016   (consisting of the contractual interest rate and the effect of interest rate swaps and floors, if applicable), using interest rate indices as of   September 30, 2016  , where applicable.

    Our share redemption program provides only for redemptions sought upon a stockholder s death,  qualifying disability  or  determination of incompetence  (each as defined in the share redemption program document, and together with redemptions sought in connection with a stockholder s death,  special redemptions ). Such redemptions are subject to the limitations described in the share redemption program document, including: 
                
    During each calendar year, special redemptions are limited to an annual dollar amount determined by the board of directors, which may be reviewed during the year and increased or decreased upon ten business days  notice to our stockholders. We may provide notice by including such information (a) in a Current Report on Form 8-K or in our annual or quarterly reports, all publicly filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission or (b) in a separate mailing to the stockholders.  On December 8, 2015, the board of directors approved the dollar amount limitation for special redemptions for calendar year 2016 of $10.0 million in the aggregate (subject to review and adjustment during the year by the board of directors), and further subject to the limitations described in the share redemption program. 
                
    During any calendar year, we may redeem no more than 5% of the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the prior calendar year. 
                
    We have no obligation to redeem shares if the redemption would violate the restrictions on distributions under Maryland General Corporation Law, as amended from time to time, which prohibits distributions that would cause a corporation to fail to meet statutory tests of solvency. 
     If we cannot repurchase all shares presented for redemption in any month because of the limitations on redemptions set forth in our share redemption program, then we will honor redemption requests on a pro rata basis, except that if a pro rata redemption would result in a stockholder owning less than the minimum purchase requirement described in our currently effective, or our most recently effective, registration statement as such registration statement has been amended or supplemented, then we would redeem all of such stockholder s shares. 
  Upon a transfer of shares, any pending redemption requests with respect to such transferred shares will be canceled as of the date the transfer is accepted by us.  Stockholders wishing to continue to have a redemption request related to any transferred shares considered by us must resubmit their redemption request. 
  Pursuant to the share redemption program, redemptions made in connection with special redemptions are made at a price per share equal to the most recent estimated value per share of our common stock as of the applicable redemption date.  We do not currently expect to have funds available for ordinary redemptions in the future.

  Item 2.    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds (continued) 

The only redemptions we made under our share redemption program during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were those that qualified as, and met the requirements for, special redemptions under our share redemption program and we fulfilled all special redemption requests eligible for redemption under our share redemption program.  We funded redemptions during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   with proceeds from the sale of real estate properties and existing cash on hand.   
  We may amend, suspend or terminate our share redemption program upon 30 days  notice to our stockholders, provided that we may increase or decrease the funding available for the redemption of shares under the program upon ten business days  notice to our stockholders. We may provide this notice by including such information in a Current Report on Form 8-K or in our annual or quarterly reports, all publicly filed with the SEC, or by a separate mailing to our stockholders.  
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we redeemed shares pursuant to our share redemption program as follows: 
   
 _____________________ 
   (1)    We announced the adoption and commencement of the program on April 8, 2008. We announced amendments to the program on May 13, 2009 (which amendment became effective on June 12, 2009), on March 11, 2011 (which amendment became effective on April 10, 2011), on May 18, 2012 (which amendment became effective on June 17, 2012), on June 29, 2012 (which amendment became effective on July 29, 2012), on October 18, 2012 (which amendment became effective on November 17, 2012), on March 8, 2013 (which amendment became effective on April 7, 2013), on October 17, 2013 (which amendment became effective on November 16, 2013) and on May 19, 2014 (which amendment became effective on June 18, 2014). 
   (2)    In accordance with our share redemption program, the redemption price for special redemptions is equal to the most recent estimated value per share of our common stock as of the redemption date.  On December 8, 2015, our board of directors approved an estimated value per share of our common stock of $5.62 (unaudited) based on the estimated value of our assets less the estimated value of our liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding, all as of September 30, 2015.  The change in the redemption price became effective for the December 31, 2015 redemption date and will be effective until the estimated value per share is updated. We expect to utilize our advisor and/or an independent valuation firm to update the estimated value per share no later than December 2016.  For a full description of the methodologies used to value our assets and liabilities in connection with the calculation of the estimated value per share, see our Current Report on Form 8-K dated December 8, 2015 and filed with the SEC on December 9, 2015. 
   (3)    We limit the dollar value of shares that may be redeemed under the share redemption program as described above.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we redeemed   $3.9 million   of shares, which represented all redemption requests received in good order and eligible for redemption through the September 2016 redemption date.  Based on the redemption limitations described above and redemptions through   September 30, 2016  , we may redeem up to $6.1 million of shares in connection with special redemptions for the remainder of 2016.

GUARANTOR S CONSENT 
    
  The undersigned (   Guarantor   ) consents to the foregoing Second Modification Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and reaffirms its obligations under the Limited Guaranty, dated September 15, 2010 (   Guaranty   ).  Guarantor reaffirms that its obligations under the Guaranty are separate and distinct from Borrower s obligations and reaffirms its waivers, as set forth in the Guaranty, of each and every one of the possible defenses to such obligations. 
    
  Guarantor agrees that each of the terms and provisions of the Guaranty are amended so as to include the guarantees and obligations of guarantor herein set forth, the terms and provisions of which are hereby incorporated herein in full as if set forth in this Consent. 
    
  Guarantor understands that the Lender s exercise of a non-judicial foreclosure sale under the Deed of Trust may, by virtue of California Code of Civil Procedure Section 580d, result in the destruction of any subrogation, reimbursement or contribution rights which Guarantor may have against Borrower.  Guarantor further understands that such exercise by Lenders and the consequent destruction of subrogation, reimbursement or contribution rights would constitute a defense to the enforcement of the Guaranty by Lenders.  With this explicit understanding, Guarantor nevertheless specifically waives any and all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by Lenders, even though that election of remedies, such as a nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security for a guaranteed obligation, has destroyed Guarantor s rights of subrogation and reimbursement against the principal by the operation of Section 580d of the California Code of Civil Procedure or otherwise.  Guarantor further specifically waives any and all rights and defenses that Guarantor may have because Borrower s debt is secured by real property; this means, among other things, that:  (1) Lenders may collect from Guarantor without first foreclosing on any real or personal property collateral pledged by Borrower; (2) if Lenders foreclose on the real property collateral pledged by Borrower, then (A) the amount of the debt may be reduced only by the price for which that collateral is sold at the foreclosure sale, even if the collateral is worth more than the sale price, and (B) Lenders may collect from Guarantor even if Lenders, by foreclosing on the real property collateral, has destroyed any right Guarantor may have to collect from Borrower.  The foregoing sentence is an unconditional and irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses Guarantor may have because Borrower s debt is secured by real property.  These rights and defenses being waived by Guarantor include, but are not limited to, any rights or defenses based upon Section 580a, 580b, 580d or 726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure.  This understanding and waiver is made in addition to and not in limitation of any of the existing terms and conditions of the Guaranty.

Exhibit 

Exhibit 10.2 
  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED SECURED PROMISSORY NOTE 

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, KBSII 445 SOUTH FIGUEROA, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (   Borrower   ), HEREBY PROMISES TO PAY to the order of WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (   Lender   ), the principal sum of Ninety Four Million Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($94,300,000), or if less, the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all disbursements disbursed by Lender pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Loan Agreement dated as of September 15, 2010, as amended pursuant to a letter agreement dated as of September 15, 2015 (as amended, supplemented or restated from time to time the    Loan Agreement   ), among Borrower, Lender, certain other Lenders named therein or made parties thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, together with interest on the unpaid principal balance hereof at the rate (or rates) determined in accordance with   Section 2.7   of the Loan Agreement from the date such principal is advanced until it is paid in full.  It is contemplated that there will be advances and payments under this Note from time to time, but no advances or payments under this Note (including payment in full of the unpaid balance of principal hereof prior to maturity) shall affect or impair the validity or enforceability of this Note as to future advances hereunder. 
  This Note is one of the Notes referred to in and governed by the Loan Agreement, which Loan Agreement, among other things, contains provisions for the acceleration of the maturity hereof and for the payment of certain additional sums to Lender upon the happening of certain stated events.  Capitalized terms used in this Note without definition have the same meanings as in the Loan Agreement. 
  The principal amount of this Note, unless accelerated in accordance with Loan Agreement as described below, if not sooner paid, will be due and payable, together with all accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts due and unpaid under the Loan Agreement, on the Maturity Date. 
  This Note is secured by, among other things, the Deed of Trust referred to in the Loan Agreement. 
  Interest on the Loan is payable in arrears on the first Business Day of each month during the term of the Loan Agreement, commencing with the first Business Day of the first calendar month to begin after the date of this Note.  Interest will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in the period during which interest accrues and a year of three hundred sixty (360) days.  The Loan Agreement provides for the payment by Borrower of various other charges and fees, in addition to the interest charges described in the Loan Agreement, as set forth more fully in the Loan Agreement. 
  All payments of any amount becoming due under this Note shall be made in the manner provided in the Loan Agreement, in Dollars. 
  Upon and after the occurrence of a Default, unless such Default is waived as provided in the Loan Agreement, this Note may, at the option of Requisite Lenders and without further demand, notice or legal process of any kind, be declared by Administrative Agent, and in such case immediately shall become, due and payable.  Upon and after the occurrence of certain Defaults, this Note shall, without any action by Lenders and without demand, notice or legal process of any kind, automatically and immediately become due and payable. 
  Demand, presentment, protest and notice of nonpayment and protest, notice of intention to accelerate maturity, notice of acceleration of maturity and notice of dishonor are hereby waived by Borrower.  Subject to the terms of the Loan Agreement, Lender may extend the time of payment of this Note, postpone the enforcement hereof, grant any indulgences, release any party primarily or secondarily liable hereon or agree to any subordination of Borrower s obligations hereunder without affecting or diminishing Lender s right of recourse against Borrower, which right is hereby expressly reserved. 

This Note has been delivered and accepted at Los Angeles, California.  This Note shall be interpreted in accordance with, and the rights and liabilities of the parties hereto shall be determined and governed by, the laws of the State of California. 
  All notices or other communications required or permitted to be given pursuant to this Note shall be given to the Borrower or Lender at the address and in the manner provided for in the Loan Agreement. 
  In no contingency or event whatsoever shall interest charged in respect of the Loan evidenced hereby, however such interest may be characterized or computed, exceed the highest rate permissible under any law that a court of competent jurisdiction shall, in a final determination, deem applicable hereto.  If such a court determines that Lender has received interest hereunder in excess of the highest rate applicable hereto, Lender shall, at Lender s election, either (a) promptly refund such excess interest to Borrower or (b) credit such excess to the principal balance hereof.  This provision shall control over every other provision of all agreements between Borrower and Lender. 
  Whenever possible each provision of this Note shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Note shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Note. 
  This Note (the    New Note   ), is issued in replacement of (i) a Second Amended and Restated Secured Promissory Note, dated March 1, 2011, in the principal amount of $54,300,000, previously issued by Borrower to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, pursuant to the Loan Agreement, and (ii) a Second Amended and Restated Secured Promissory Note, dated March 1, 2011, in the principal amount of $40,000,000, previously issued by Borrower to Union Bank, N.A., pursuant to the Loan Agreement (together, the    Previous Notes   ) and shall not be construed as a novation of the Previous Notes.  Aggregate amounts outstanding under the Previous Notes shall be deemed outstanding under the New Note.  
  The limitations on personal liability of the shareholders, partners and members of Borrower contained in   Section 13.27   of the Loan Agreement shall apply to this Note.
