  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED   AUGUST 28, 2016    
   
  NOTE   1  :     SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Nature of Operations 
  Levi Strauss   Co. (the  Company ) is one of the world s largest brand-name apparel companies. The Company designs, markets and sells   directly or through third parties and licensees   products that include jeans, casual and dress pants, tops, shorts, skirts, jackets, footwear and related accessories for men, women and children around the world under the Levi s       , Dockers       , Signature by Levi Strauss   Co.  and Denizen        brands.  The Company operates its business through three geographic regions: Americas, Europe and Asia. 
  Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation 
  The unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its wholly-owned and majority-owned foreign and domestic subsidiaries are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the financial position and the results of operations for the periods presented have been included. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended   November 29, 2015  , included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on February 11, 2016. 
  The unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Management believes the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented herein not misleading. The results of operations for the   three and nine months ended     August 28, 2016  , may not be indicative of the results to be expected for any other interim period or the year ending   November 27, 2016  . 
  The Company s fiscal year ends on the last Sunday of November in each year, although the fiscal years of certain foreign subsidiaries end on November 30. Each quarter of both fiscal years   2016   and   2015   consists of   13   weeks. All references to years relate to fiscal years rather than calendar years. 
  Subsequent events have been evaluated through the issuance date of these financial statements. 
  The Company's consolidated statements of comprehensive income for all periods presented have been conformed to show each component of other comprehensive income before related income tax effects with one amount shown for aggregate income tax expense related to the total of other comprehensive income items. Each component was previously presented net of related income tax effects. There was no change to total comprehensive income, net of income taxes, and the change was immaterial to the financial statements taken as a whole.   
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements. Estimates are based upon historical factors, current circumstances and the experience and judgment of the Company s management. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in its evaluations. Changes in such estimates, based on more accurate future information, or different assumptions or conditions, may affect amounts reported in future periods.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  There have been no developments to recently issued accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on the Company s consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures, from those disclosed in the Company s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K, except for the following, which have been grouped by their effective dates for the Company: 
  First Quarter of 2018 
             
    In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update No. ("ASU") 2016-06,   Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815)   Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments  , which will reduce diversity of practice in identifying embedded derivatives in debt instruments.  ASU 2016-06 clarifies that the nature of an exercise contingency is not subject to the  clearly and closely  criteria for purposes of assessing whether the call or put option must be separated from the debt instrument and accounted for separately as a derivative.  The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. 
                
    In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  .  ASU 2016-09 identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows.  The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. 
     First Quarter of 2019 
             
    In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-04,   Liabilities   Extinguishment of Liabilities (Subtopic 405-20): Recognition of Breakage for Certain Prepaid Stored-Value Products  .  ASU 2016-04 aligns recognition of the financial liabilities related to prepaid stored-value products (for example, prepaid gift cards), with Topic 606,   Revenues from Contracts with Customers,   for non-financial liabilities.  In general, certain or these liabilities may be extinguished proportionally in earnings as redemptions occur, or when redemption is remote if issuers are not entitled to the unredeemed stored value.  The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)     Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.    ASU 2016-15 eliminates the diversity in practice related to the classification of certain cash receipts and payments for debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, the maturing of a zero coupon bond, the settlement of contingent liabilities arising from a business combination, proceeds from insurance settlements, distributions from certain equity method investees and beneficial interests obtained in a financial asset securitization.  ASU 2016-15 designates the appropriate cash flow classification, including requirements to allocate certain components of these cash receipts and payments among operating, investing and financing activities.  The retrospective transition method, requiring adjustment to all comparative periods presented, is required unless it is impracticable for some of the amendments, in which case those amendments would be prospectively as of the earliest date practicable.  The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. 

March 2016 - ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)   .  ASU 2016-08 clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations.  The guidance includes indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to customers.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (continued) 
  FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 28, 2016 

April 2016 -  ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):  Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.    ASU 2016-10 covers      two specific topics:  performance obligations and licensing. This amendment includes guidance on immaterial promised goods or services, shipping or handling activities, separately identifiable performance obligations, functional or symbolic intellectual property licenses, sales-based and usage-based royalties, license restrictions (time, use, geographical) and licensing renewals.   
                
    May 2016 - ASU 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):  Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  .  ASU 2016-12 clarifies certain core recognition principles including collectability, sales tax presentation, noncash consideration, contract modifications and completed contracts at transition and disclosures no longer required if the full retrospective transition method is adopted. 
     The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting these new accounting standards will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. 

First Quarter of 2020 
             
    In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  . ASU 2016-02 requires the identification of arrangements that should be accounted for as leases by lessees.  In general, for lease arrangements exceeding a twelve month term, these arrangements must now be recognized as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet of the lessee.  Under ASU 2016-02, a right-of-use asset and lease obligation will be recorded for all leases, whether operating or financing, while the income statement will reflect lease expense for operating leases and amortization/interest expense for financing leases.  The balance sheet amount recorded for existing leases at the date of adoption of ASU 2016-02 must be calculated using the applicable incremental borrowing rate at the date of adoption.  In addition, ASU 2016-02 requires the use of the modified retrospective method, which will require adjustment to all comparative periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.  The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.  
       
  First Quarter of 2021 
             
    In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326):  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  .  ASU 2016-13 amends the impairment model to utilize an expected loss methodology in place of the currently used incurred loss methodology, which will result in the more timely recognition of losses.  ASU 2016-13 also applies to employee benefit plan accounting, with an effective date of the first quarter of fiscal 2022.   The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements, footnote disclosures and employee benefit plans  accounting.

NOTE   6  :     RESTRUCTURING  
  In 2014, the Company announced and began to implement a global productivity initiative designed to streamline operations and fuel long-term profitable growth focused on redesigning business processes and identifying opportunities to reduce costs, increase efficiencies and further streamline processes in supporting functions, supply chain and planning. The Company expects that the majority of the actions related to the global productivity initiative will be implemented through the end of 2016. 
  For the   three and nine months ended     August 28, 2016  , the Company recognized net restructuring reversals and charges, of   $0.6 million   and   $1.0 million  , respectively, as compared to net restructuring charges of   $4.1 million   and   $11.4 million  , respectively, for the same periods in   2015  . These net restructuring reversals and charges were recorded in "Restructuring, net" in the Company's consolidated statements of income.  Related charges of   $1.3 million   and   $5.8 million   for the   three- and nine-month period  s ended   August 28, 2016  , as compared to   $7.7 million   and   $28.1 million   for the same periods in   2015  , consist primarily of consulting fees for the Company's centrally-led cost-savings and productivity projects, as well as transition costs associated with the Company's decision to outsource certain global business service activities.  These related charges represent costs incurred associated with ongoing operations which are expected to benefit future periods and thus were recorded in "Selling, general and administrative expenses" in the Company's consolidated statements of income.  Cash payments for charges recognized to date are expected to continue through 2017. 
  The table below summarizes the components of charges included in  Restructuring, net  in the Company s consolidated statements of income: 

_____________ 
    
           (1) 
    Severance and employee-related benefits relate to items such as severance, based on separation benefits provided by Company policy or statutory benefit plans, out-placement services and career counseling for employees affected by the global productivity initiative.  
       
           (2) 
    Other restructuring costs are expensed as incurred and primarily relate to consulting fees and legal expenses associated with the execution of the restructuring initiative. 
       
           (3) 
    Noncash pension and postretirement curtailment gains or losses resulting from the global productivity initiative are included in restructuring charges, with the associated liabilities included in "Pension liability" and "Postretirement medical benefits" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. 
     The Company does not anticipate any significant additional costs associated with the global productivity initiative.

NOTE   7  :     COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts 
  The Company uses over-the-counter derivative instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currencies. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the forward foreign exchange contracts. However, the Company believes that its exposures are appropriately diversified across counterparties and that these counterparties are creditworthy financial institutions. Please see Note   3   for additional information. 
  Other Contingencies 
  Litigation.    There have been no material developments with respect to the information previously reported in the Company s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K related to legal proceedings. 
                                                                                                                                                                    
  In the ordinary course of business, the Company has various pending cases involving contractual matters, facility and employee-related matters, distribution matters, product liability claims, trademark infringement and other matters. The Company does not believe any of these pending legal proceedings will have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

NOTE   10  :     OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET 
  The following table summarizes significant components of  Other income (expense), net :    

_____________ 
    
           (1) 
    Gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts primarily result from currency fluctuations relative to negotiated contract rates.  Gains in the nine-month period ended August 30, 2015 were primarily due to favorable currency fluctuations relative to negotiated contract rates on positions to sell the Mexican Peso, partially offset by unfavorable currency fluctuations relative to negotiated contract rates on positions to sell the Euro.  
       
           (2) 
    Foreign currency transaction gains and losses reflect the impact of foreign currency fluctuation on the Company's foreign currency denominated balances.  Losses in 2015 were primarily due to the weakening of various foreign currencies, particularly the Euro, against the U.S. Dollar. 

NOTE   11  :     INCOME TAXES 
  The effective income tax rate was   28.2%   for the   nine months ended     August 28, 2016  , compared to   35.1%   for the same period ended   August 30, 2015  .   
  The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily reflected a discrete tax benefit attributable to deductions for worthless debts in a consolidated subsidiary,  as well as a  higher proportion of  2016 earnings in jurisdictions where the Company is subject to lower tax rates.  

NOTE   12  :     RELATED PARTIES 
  Robert D. Haas, Chairman Emeritus of the Company, Charles V. Bergh, President and Chief Executive Officer, Peter E. Haas Jr., a director of the Company, and Kelly McGinnis, Senior Vice President of Corporate Affairs and Chief Communications Officer, are board members of the Levi Strauss Foundation, which is not a consolidated entity of the Company. Seth R. Jaffe, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, is Vice President of the Levi Strauss Foundation.

Item 2. 
    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    

Overview 
  We design, market and sell   directly or through third parties and licensees   products that include jeans, casual and dress pants, tops, shorts, skirts, jackets, footwear and related accessories for men, women and children around the world under our Levi s       , Dockers       , Signature by Levi Strauss   Co.  ( Signature ) and Denizen        brands. 
  Our business is operated through three geographic regions: Americas, Europe and Asia. Our products are sold in approximately 50,000 retail locations in more than   110   countries. We support our brands through a global infrastructure, developing, sourcing and marketing our products around the world. We distribute our Levi s        and Dockers        products primarily through chain retailers and department stores in the United States and primarily through department stores, specialty retailers and approximately   2,200   franchised or other brand-dedicated stores and shop-in-shops outside of the United States. We also distribute our Levi s        and Dockers        products through   671   company-operated stores located in   31   countries, including the United States, and through the ecommerce sites we operate. Our company-operated stores and ecommerce sites generated approximately   27%   of our net revenues in the first nine months of   2016  , as compared to   26%   in the same period in   2015  , with our ecommerce sites representing approximately   13%   of this revenue in   2016  , as compared to   12%   in the same period in   2015  . In addition, we distribute our Levi s        and Dockers        products through ecommerce sites operated by certain of our key wholesale customers and other third parties. We distribute products under our Signature and Denizen        brands primarily through mass channel retailers in the Americas.  
  Our Europe and Asia businesses, collectively, contributed approximately   42%   of our net revenues and   43%   of our regional operating income in the first nine months of   2016  , as compared to   41%   of our net revenues and   40%   of our regional operating income in the same period in 2015. Sales of Levi s        brand products represented approximately   85%   of our total net sales in the first   nine-month period  s, both in   2016   and   2015  . 
  Trends Affecting Our Business 
  Our key long-term objectives are to strengthen our brands globally in order to deliver sustainable profitable growth, generate strong cash flow and reduce our debt. Critical strategies to achieve these objectives include driving our profitable core business; expanding the reach of our global brands and building a more balanced product portfolio; elevating the performance of our retail channel, including ecommerce; and leveraging our global scale to improve our cost structure. 
  Consumer discretionary spending, which remains mixed globally, continues to result in a challenging retail environment for us and our customers, characterized by declining traffic patterns and contributing to a generally promotional environment.  In developed economies, slow real wage growth and a shift in consumer spending to interest-rate sensitive durable goods and other non-apparel categories also continue to pressure global discretionary spending.  Given consumers  increasing focus on value pricing amid the slowly recovering economy, the off-price retail channel remains strong, partially to the detriment of traditional broadline retailers, particularly at the mid-tier. These trends are partially offset by continued economic growth in developing economies such as Mexico and China, where rising incomes and an expanding middle class create new consumers for our products.  Both our wholesale and retail channels continue to face competition from ecommerce shopping enabled by the proliferation of online technologies, which constitutes an increasing proportion of global apparel sales, particularly around key selling seasons.  Some competitors also continue to expand their global footprints in both brick-and-mortar retail and online.  Currency values continue to be in a state of constant flux. The appreciation of the U.S. Dollar against various foreign currencies, particularly the Euro and British Pound,  will continue to impact our financial results, affecting translation, margins, as well as traffic in stores located in or near major domestic tourist destinations. 
  Our   Third   Quarter   2016   Results 

Net revenues.    Compared to the   third   quarter of    2015  , consolidated net revenues increased   4%   on a reported basis and increased   5%   on a constant-currency basis driven by higher retail revenues from expansion and improved performance of our retail network in all three regions.  
                
    Operating income  .  Compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  , consolidated operating income increased by   26%   and operating margin improved to   12%  , primarily reflecting higher constant-currency revenues and lower SG A and restructuring expenses. 
                  
    Cash flows.    Cash flows provided by operating activities were   $102.8 million   for the   nine-month period   in   2016   as compared to   $110.3 million   for the same period in   2015  ; the decrease reflects our higher inventory levels, offset by lower payments to vendors for SG A and restructuring-related items.

Financial Information Presentation 
  Fiscal year  .      Our fiscal year ends on the last Sunday of November in each year, although the fiscal years of certain foreign subsidiaries end on November 30.  Each quarter of fiscal years   2016   and   2015   consists of 13 weeks.  
  Segments  .      We manage our business according to three regional segments: the Americas, Europe and Asia.  
  Classification  .      Our classification of certain significant revenues and expenses reflects the following: 

Net revenues is primarily comprised of sales of products to wholesale customers, including franchised stores, and direct sales to consumers at our company-operated ecommerce sites and stores and at our company-operated shop-in-shops located within department stores. It includes discounts, allowances for estimated returns and incentives. Net revenues also includes royalties earned from the use of our trademarks by third-party licensees in connection with the manufacturing, advertising and distribution of trademarked products. 
                
    Cost of goods sold is primarily comprised of product costs, labor and related overhead, sourcing costs, inbound freight, internal transfers, and the cost of operating our remaining manufacturing facilities, including the related depreciation expense. 
                
    Selling costs include, among other things, all occupancy costs and depreciation associated with our company-operated stores and commissions associated with our company-operated shop-in-shops, as well as costs associated with our ecommerce operations. 
                
    We reflect substantially all distribution costs in selling, general and administrative expenses, including costs related to receiving and inspection at distribution centers, warehousing, shipping to our customers, handling, and certain other activities associated with our distribution network. 
     Gross margins may not be comparable to those of other companies in our industry since some companies may include costs related to their distribution network and occupancy costs associated with company-operated stores in cost of goods sold. 
  Constant currency  .      Constant-currency comparisons are based on translating local currency amounts in the prior-year period at actual foreign exchange rates for the current year. We routinely evaluate our financial performance on a constant-currency basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons without regard to the impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates.

Results of Operations for   Three and Nine Months Ended     August 28, 2016  , as Compared to Same   Periods   in   2015    
  The following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, our consolidated statements of income, the changes in these items from period to period and these items expressed as a percentage of net revenues:

Table of Contents  

Net revenues 
  The following table presents net revenues by reporting segment for the periods indicated and the changes in net revenues by reporting segment on both reported and constant-currency bases from period to period. 

Total net revenues increased on a both a reported and constant-currency basis for the   three- and nine-month period  s ended   August 28, 2016  , as compared to the same prior-year period.  
  Americas  .      On a both a reported basis and constant-currency basis, net revenues in our Americas region increased for the three-month period, and were relatively flat for the nine-month period ended    August 28, 2016  , with currency affecting net revenues unfavorably by approximately   $8 million   and   $27 million  , respectively. 
  Excluding the effects of currency, the increase in net revenues for the   three- and nine-month period  s ended   August 28, 2016   was due to retail and wholesale growth in Mexico and the performance and expansion of our company-operated retail network, including ecommerce, in the United States. Overall, the United States declined as the retail growth was more than offset by lower wholesale revenues in the United States due to a continued weak environment for apparel retailers. 
  Europe  .    Net revenues in Europe increased both on a reported basis and constant-currency basis for each of the    three- and nine-month period  s ended   August 28, 2016  , with currency affecting net revenues unfavorably by approximately   $2 million   and    $23 million   during the   three- and nine-month period  s ended   August 28, 2016  , respectively. 
  Constant-currency net revenues increased as a result of strong performance and expansion of our company-operated retail network, including e-commerce.  
  Asia  .      Net revenues in Asia increased on both a reported and constant-currency basis for the   three- and nine-month period  s ended   August 28, 2016   with currency affecting net revenues minimally during the three-month period and unfavorably by approximately   $21 million   during the nine-month period ended   August 28, 2016  .  
  The increase in net revenues was primarily due to the performance and expansion of our company-operated retail network and improved wholesale performance.

Table of Contents  

Gross profit 
  The following table shows consolidated gross profit and gross margin for the periods indicated and the changes in these items from period to period:    

Currency translation unfavorably impacted gross profit by approximately   $5 million   and   $34 million   for the   three- and nine-month period  s ended   August 28, 2016  , respectively.  In both periods, gross margin benefited from lower negotiated product costs and streamlined supply chain operations. These benefits were fully offset in the three-month period by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency transaction losses related to the procurement of inventory and a decline in margin in the United States wholesale channel.  

Selling, general and administrative expenses 
  The following table shows our selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG A ) for the periods indicated, the changes in these items from period to period and these items expressed as a percentage of net revenues: 

Currency impacted SG A favorably by approximately   $4 million   and   $23 million   for the   three- and nine-month period  s ended   August 28, 2016  , respectively.  
  Selling  .    Currency impacted selling expenses favorably by approximately   $2 million   and   $14 million   for the   three- and nine-month period  s ended   August 28, 2016  . Higher selling expenses primarily reflected costs associated with the expansion of our company-operated store network and investment in our ecommerce business. We had   42   more company-operated stores at the end of the   third   quarter of   2016   than we did at the end of the   third   quarter of   2015  .   
  Advertising and promotion  .     Currency did not have a significant impact on advertising and promotion expenses for the three-month period ended   August 28, 2016   and had a favorable impact of approximately   $3 million   for the nine-month period ended   August 28, 2016  .  The decrease in advertising and promotion expenses for the three-month period reflects a difference in the timing of production and media spend for our campaigns.  For the nine-month period, advertising and promotion as a percentage of net revenues remained relatively flat in comparison to prior year.

     Table of Contents  

Administration  .      Administration expenses include functional administrative and organization costs. Currency did not have a significant impact on administration expenses for the   three months ended     August 28, 2016   and had a favorable impact of approximately   $3 million   for the   nine months ended     August 28, 2016  .  As compared to the same prior-year periods, administration expenses in 2016 reflect the third quarter recognition of approximately $7.0 million of benefit as a result of the resolution of a vendor dispute and the related reversal of liabilities recorded in a prior year.  Lower organization costs including salaries, benefits and long-term incentive compensation also contributed to the decrease in both periods. 
  Other  .     Other SG A includes distribution, information resources, and marketing organization costs.   Currency did not have a significant impact on other SG A expenses for the   three months ended     August 28, 2016   and had a favorable impact of approximately   $3 million   for the   nine months ended     August 28, 2016  .  For the three-month period, higher other SG A costs primarily reflected increased information technology expenses.  The increase in the nine-month period reflects higher information technology expenses and distribution costs.  Additionally, we recorded a gain of $6.1 million in conjunction with the sale-leaseback of our distribution center in the United Kingdom in 2016 as compared to a $7.5 million gain recognized related to the sale of our finishing and distribution facility in Turkey in 2015.  
  Restructuring-related charges  .    Restructuring-related charges consist primarily of consulting fees incurred for our centrally-led cost-savings and productivity projects, as well as transition costs associated with our decision to outsource certain global business service activities.  These related charges represent costs incurred associated with ongoing operations which are expected to benefit future periods and thus were recorded in SG A in the Company's consolidated statements of income.  
   
  Operating income 
  The following table shows operating income by reporting segment and corporate expenses for the periods indicated, the changes in these items from period to period and these items expressed as a percentage of net revenues: 

______________ 
   * Percentage of consolidated net revenues 
  Currency translation had no significant impact on total operating income for the three-month period and unfavorably affected total operating income by approximately   $11 million   for the nine-month period ended   August 28, 2016  .

     Table of Contents  

Regional operating income  .     
             
    Americas  .  Currency translation unfavorably affected operating income in the region by approximately   $2 million   and   $5 million   for the   three- and nine-month period  s ended   August 28, 2016  , respectively.  For the nine-month period ended   August 28, 2016  , the decline in operating income is primarily due to lower net revenues and gross margin, as well as higher advertising expenses in the region. For the three months, the increase includes approximately $7.0 million of benefit resulting from the resolution of a vendor dispute and decreased advertising and promotion expenses.  
                
    Europe  .   Currency translation favorably affected operating income in the region by approximately   $2 million   for the three-month period ended    August 28, 2016  , and unfavorably affected operating income in the region by approximately   $2 million   for the nine-month period ended   August 28, 2016  .  Excluding the effect of currency, operating income and operating margin increased in both periods due to the region's higher net revenues, partially offset by an increased investment in retail.  
                
    Asia  .  Currency translation had no significant impact on operating income for the three-month period and unfavorably affected operating income by approximately   $6 million   for the nine-month period ended   August 28, 2016  .   The decrease in operating income for the three-month period primarily reflected the region's lower gross margin and higher investment in retail in the region. Excluding the effect of currency, operating income remained relatively flat for the nine-month period ended   August 28, 2016   in comparison to the same period in prior year. 
     Corporate  .      Corporate expenses represent costs that are not attributed to any of our regional operating segments.  Included in corporate expenses are restructuring charges, the consulting fees incurred for our centrally-led cost-savings and productivity projects, and other corporate staff costs.  Currency translation did not have a significant impact on corporate expenses for the   three- and nine-month period  s ended   August 28, 2016  .  As compared to the same prior-year period, corporate expenses primarily reflected lower foreign currency transaction losses related to our global sourcing organization's procurement of inventory on behalf of our foreign subsidiaries, as well as lower restructuring and restructuring-related charges.   
   
  Interest expense 
  Interest expense was   $19.2 million   and   $54.5 million   for the   three- and nine-month period  s ended   August 28, 2016  , respectively, as compared to   $17.2 million   and   $62.3 million   for the same periods in   2015  .  The increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher interest expense on our deferred compensation plans.  
  Our weighted-average interest rate on average borrowings outstanding during the   three and nine months ended     August 28, 2016  , was   6.22%   and   6.30%  , respectively, as compared to   6.17%   and   6.85%  , respectively, in the same periods in   2015  . 
  Loss on early extinguishment of debt 
  During the nine months ended August 30, 2015, we recorded a $14.0 million loss on early extinguishment of debt as a result of our debt refinancing activities during the period. The loss was comprised of tender and redemption premiums of $7.5 million, the write-off of $3.5 million of unamortized debt issuance costs, and $3.0 million of other costs. 
  Other income (expense), net 
  Other income (expense), net, primarily consists of foreign exchange management activities and transactions. For the   three- and nine-month period  s ended   August 28, 2016  , we recorded income of   $4.7 million   and   $6.8 million  , respectively, as compared to net expense of   $8.3 million   and   $26.7 million   for the same prior-year periods.  The income in the three-month period in 2016 primarily reflected net gains on our foreign currency denominated balances.  Income in the nine-month period in 2016 primarily reflected gains on our foreign exchange contracts and other income.  The net expenses in the three-month period in 2015 reflected net losses on our foreign currency denominated balances, partially offset by net income on our embedded derivatives and over-the-counter forward foreign exchange contracts.  The income in the nine-month period in 2015 primarily reflected net losses on foreign currency denominated balances. 
  Income tax expense 
  The effective income tax rate was   28.2%   for the   nine months ended     August 28, 2016  , compared to   35.1%   for the same period ended   August 30, 2015  .  
  The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily reflected a discrete tax benefit recorded in the third quarter of 2016 attributable to deductions for worthless debts in a consolidated subsidiary as well as a  higher proportion of 2016 earnings in jurisdictions where we are subject to lower tax rates.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Liquidity outlook 
  We believe we will have adequate liquidity over the next twelve months to operate our business and to meet our cash requirements. 
  Cash sources 
  We are a privately-held corporation. We have historically relied primarily on cash flows from operations, borrowings under credit facilities, issuances of notes and other forms of debt financing. We regularly explore financing and debt reduction alternatives, including new credit agreements, unsecured and secured note issuances, equity financing, equipment and real estate financing, securitizations and asset sales.  
  We are borrowers under a senior secured revolving credit facility. The facility is an asset-based facility, in which the borrowing availability is primarily based on the value of our U.S. Levi s        trademarks and the levels of accounts receivable and inventory in the United States and Canada. The maximum availability under the facility is $850 million, of which $800 million is available to us for revolving loans in U.S. Dollars and $50 million is available to us for revolving loans either in U.S. Dollars or Canadian Dollars. 
  As of   August 28, 2016  , we had borrowings of   $30 million   under the credit facility, all of which is classified as short-term debt.  Unused availability under the credit facility was   $665.0 million  , as our total availability of   $718.5 million  , based on collateral levels as defined by the agreement, was reduced by   $53.5 million   of other credit-related instruments. 
  As of   August 28, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately   $271.6 million  , resulting in a total liquidity position (unused availability and cash and cash equivalents) of approximately   $936.6 million    
  Cash uses 
  Our principal cash requirements include working capital, capital expenditures, payments of principal and interest on our debt, payments of taxes, contributions to our pension plans and payments for postretirement health benefit plans, settlement of shares issued under our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended to date ("EIP"), and, if market conditions warrant, occasional investments in, or acquisitions of, business ventures in our line of business. In addition, we regularly evaluate our ability to pay dividends or repurchase stock, all consistent with the terms of our debt agreements. 
  There have been no material changes to our estimated cash requirements for   2016   from those disclosed in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K, except that capital expenditures are now estimated to be in the range of $110 - $120 million, and potential payments in 2016 under the terms of the EIP are now estimated to be insignificant. 
  Cash flows 
  The following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, selected items in our consolidated statements of cash flows: 

Cash flows from operating activities 
  Cash provided by operating activities was   $102.8 million   for the   nine-month period   in   2016  , as compared to   $110.3 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The decrease reflects our higher inventory levels, primarily driven by timing of receipts and lower than anticipated demand in the U.S., partially offset by lower payments to vendors for SG A and restructuring-related items. 

29 

     Table of Contents  

Cash flows from investing activities 
  Cash used for investing activities was   $36.1 million   for the   nine-month period   in   2016  , as compared to   $53.6 million   for the same period in   2015  . The decrease in cash used for investing activities as compared to the prior year primarily reflected proceeds from the settlement of our forward foreign exchange contracts and cash received from the sale-leaseback of our distribution center in the United Kingdom, partially offset by increased investment in information technology systems and distribution. 
  Cash flows from financing activities 
  Cash used for financing activities was   $115.7 million   for the   nine-month period   in   2016  , as compared to   $62.9 million   for the same period in   2015  . Cash used in 2016 primarily reflected net repayments on our senior revolving credit facility and the payment of a $60 million cash dividend in the second quarter of 2016. Cash used in 2015 primarily reflected the payment of a $50 million cash dividend as well as our refinancing activities and debt reduction during the period. 
  Indebtedness 
  The borrower of substantially all of our debt is Levi Strauss   Co., the parent and U.S. operating company. Of our total debt of   $1.1 billion   as of   August 28, 2016  , we had fixed-rate debt of   $1.1 billion   (  96.1%   of total debt), net of capitalized debt issuance costs, and variable-rate debt of   $43.1 million   (  3.9%   of total debt).  As of   August 28, 2016  , our required aggregate debt principal payments on our unsecured long-term debt were   $1.0 billion   in years after 2021.  Current maturities of our 4.25% Yen-denominated Eurobonds due 2016 will be paid in 2016.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Item 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit to the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  We have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   August 28, 2016  . Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that as of   August 28, 2016  , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
  Changes in Internal Controls 
  We maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that our books and records accurately reflect our transactions and that our established policies and procedures are followed. We continued the transition of certain global business service activities to our outsourced service provider during our last fiscal quarter, and this resulted in a change to our processes and control environment. There were no other changes to our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. 
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

Litigation.      There have been no material developments with respect to the information previously reported in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K related to legal proceedings. 
  In the ordinary course of business, we have various pending cases involving contractual matters, facility and employee-related matters, distribution matters, product liability claims, trademark infringement and other matters. We do not believe any of these pending legal proceedings will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

Item 1A. 
    RISK FACTORS 

There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Item 2. 
    UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

On July 13, 2016, our Board of Directors (the  Board ) approved the award of restricted stock units ( RSUs ) representing an aggregate of 21,652 shares of our common stock to our non-employee directors. The RSUs were granted as a part of the standard annual compensation provided to our non-employee directors. These awards were made under our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan. 
    
  RSUs are units, representing beneficial ownership interests, corresponding in number and value to a specified number of underlying shares of stock. The RSUs vest in three equal installments after 13, 24 and 36 months following the grant date. However, if the recipient's continuous service terminates for any reason other than for cause after the first vesting installment, but prior to full vesting, then the remaining unvested portion of the award becomes fully vested as of the date of such termination. Each recipient's initial grant of RSUs is subject to a mandatory deferral feature, by which the RSU will be converted to a share of common stock six months after discontinuation of service with the Company for each fully vested RSU held at that date. For subsequent grants, recipients of the RSUs have the opportunity to make deferral elections regarding when shares of our common stock are to be delivered in settlement of vested RSUs. If the recipient does not elect to defer the receipt of common stock, then the RSUs are immediately converted into shares upon vesting. The RSUs additionally have  dividend equivalent rights , of which dividends paid by the Company on its common stock are credited by the equivalent addition of RSUs. 
    
  Also, on July 13, 2016, our Board approved the award of stock appreciation rights ( SARs ) to certain of our executives.  These SARs represent 177,455 shares of our common stock at target levels of performance and 212,946 shares of our common stock at maximum levels of performance.  These awards were made under our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan. 
    
  SARs are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock, as determined under the Plan, on the date of grant. The SARs were granted in two groups and are identical except as described below: 
    
     106,473 of the SARs, referred to as service-vested SARs, were granted with the following vesting schedule: 25% percent of the SAR grant vests on the one-year anniversary of the date of grant, with the remaining 75% balance vesting monthly over 36 months commencing on the month following such anniversary; and 
     The remaining SARs, representing 70,982 shares at target levels of performance and 106,473 shares at maximum levels of performance, are referred to as performance-based SARs and were granted with the following vesting schedule: 50% of the performance-based SARs will vest to the extent that the Company has achieved certain goals based on the Company's (i) average earnings before interest and taxes margin percentage and (ii) the compound annual growth rate of the Company's net revenues, each over fiscal years 2016, 2017 and 2018 and the remaining 50% of the performance-based SARs will vest based on the Company's performance against a three-year market-related relative total shareholder return goal.  Our Board will determine the extent to which the goals under the performance-based SARs have been satisfied on or before March 1, 2019. 
    
  Upon the exercise of a SAR, the recipient will be entitled to receive common stock with an aggregate fair market value equal to the excess of the per share fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of exercise over the exercise price, multiplied by the number of SARs exercised. 

34 

     Table of Contents  

We will not receive any proceeds from the issuance or vesting of RSUs or SARs. The RSUs and SARs were granted under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Section 4(a)(2) generally provides an exemption from registration for transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering. 
    
  We are a privately-held corporation; there is no public trading of our common stock. As of   October 6, 2016  , we had   37,470,158   shares outstanding.
