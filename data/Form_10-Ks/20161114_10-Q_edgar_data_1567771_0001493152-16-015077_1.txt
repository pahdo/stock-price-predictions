Note
2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Basis
of Presentation - Unaudited Interim Financial Information    

The
accompanying unaudited interim financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information, and with the rules
and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation
S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.
The unaudited interim financial statements furnished reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which are,
in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. Unaudited interim
results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full fiscal year. These unaudited interim consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2015 and
notes thereto contained in the information as part of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on April 8, 2016.  

Use
of Estimates and Assumptions    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period.  

Critical
accounting estimates are estimates for which (a) the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and
judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and (b) the impact
of the estimate on financial condition or operating performance is material. The Company s critical accounting estimates
and assumptions affecting the financial statements were:  

(i)  
       Assumption
    as a going concern : Management assumes that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity
    of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.   

(ii)  
       Allowance
    for doubtful accounts : Management s estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical sales,
    historical loss levels, and an analysis of the collectability of individual accounts; and general economic conditions that
    may affect a client s ability to pay. The Company evaluated the key factors and assumptions used to develop the allowance
    in determining that it is reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole.   

(iii)  
       Valuation
    allowance for deferred tax assets : Management assumes that the realization of the Company s net deferred tax assets
    resulting from its net operating loss ( NOL ) carry-forwards for Federal income tax purposes that may be offset
    against future taxable income was not considered more likely than not and accordingly, the potential tax benefits of the net
    loss carry-forwards are offset by a full valuation allowance. Management made this assumption based on (a) the Company has
    incurred recurring losses, (b) general economic conditions, and (c) its ability to raise additional funds to support its daily
    operations by way of a public or private offering, among other factors.   

These
significant accounting estimates or assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached
to these estimates or assumptions, and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value.

   September

   Notes
to the Financial Statements   

   (Unaudited)   

Management
bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the
financial statements taken as a whole under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  

Management
regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information, changes
in facts and circumstances, historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such evaluations, if deemed appropriate, those
estimates are adjusted accordingly.  

Actual
results could differ from those estimates.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments    

The
Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial
instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( Paragraph 820-10-35-37 ) to
measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37
establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three
(3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by
Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:  

Level
    1  
      Quoted
    market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.   

Level
    2  
       Pricing
                                         inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either
                                         directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.    

Level
    3  
      Pricing
    inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.   

Financial
assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or
similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.  

The
fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within
more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement of the instrument.  

The
carrying amount of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and
accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.  

Transactions
involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm s-length basis, as the requisite conditions of
competitive, free-market dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply
that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm s-length transactions
unless such representations can be substantiated.  

The
Company includes fair value information in the notes to financial statements when the fair value of its financial instruments
is different from the book value. When the book value approximates fair value, no additional disclosure is made.

Valuation
of Derivatives    

The
Company evaluates its convertible instruments, options, warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded
components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for under ASC Topic 815,  Derivatives and
Hedging.  The result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the derivative is marked-to-market each balance
sheet date. The change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as other income (expense). Upon conversion or
exercise of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is
reclassified to equity. Equity instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification under
ASC Topic 815 are reclassified to liabilities at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date. We analyzed the
derivative financial instruments in accordance with ASC 815. The objective is to provide guidance for determining whether an equity-linked
financial instrument is indexed to an entity s own stock. This determination is needed for a scope exception which would
enable a derivative instrument to be accounted for under the accrual method. The classification of a non-derivative instrument
that falls within the scope of ASC 815-40-05  Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially
Settled in, a Company s Own Stock  also hinges on whether the instrument is indexed to an entity s own stock.
A non-derivative instrument that is not indexed to an entity s own stock cannot be classified as equity and must be accounted
for as a liability. There is a two-step approach in determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s
own stock. First, the instrument s contingent exercise provisions, if any, must be evaluated, followed by an evaluation
of the instrument s settlement provisions. The Company utilized multinomial lattice models that value the derivative liability
based on a probability weighted discounted cash flow model. The Company utilized the fair value standard set forth by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board, defined as the amount at which the assets (or liability) could be bought (or incurred) or sold (or
settled) in a current transaction between willing parties, that is, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.  

The
derivative liabilities result in a reduction of the initial carrying amount (as unamortized discount) of the Convertible Notes.
This derivative liability is marked-to-market each quarter with the change in fair value recorded in the income statement. Unamortized
discount is amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the Convertible Note.  

Cash
Equivalents    

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. There
were no cash equivalents as at September 30, 2016.  

Furniture
and Fixtures    

Furniture
and fixtures are recorded at cost. Expenditures for major additions and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are
charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method (after taking into account their respective
estimated residual values) over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows:  

Estimated
      
     Useful Life   
     (Years)  

Furniture
    and fixture  

7  

Upon
sale or retirement, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected
in the statements of operations.  

Related
Parties    

The
Company follows subtopic 850-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the identification of related parties and disclosure
of related party transactions.  

Pursuant
to Section 850-10-20 the Related parties include: a. affiliates of the Company ( Affiliate  means, with respect to
any specified Person, any other Person that, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled
by or is under common control with such Person, as such terms are used in and construed under Rule 405 under the Securities Act);
b. entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required, absent the election of the fair value option under
the Fair Value Option Subsection of Section 825-10-15, to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; c. trusts
for the benefit of employees, such as pension and profit-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management;
d. principal owners of the Company; e. management of the Company; f. other parties with which the Company may deal if one party
controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting
parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and g. other parties that can significantly influence
the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties
and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully
pursuing its own separate interests.

   September

   Notes
to the Financial Statements   

   (Unaudited)   

The
financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense
allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated
in the preparation of financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include:  

a.
      
      the
    nature of the relationship(s) involved;    

b.
      
      a
    description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of
    the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding of
    the effects of the transactions on the financial statements;    

c.
      
      the
    dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change
    in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period; and    

d.
      
      a
    amounts due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and, if not otherwise apparent, the
    terms and manner of settlement.   

Commitments
and contingencies    

The
Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Certain
conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will
only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and
such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that
are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived
merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected
to be sought therein.  

If
the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability
can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company s financial statements. If the assessment
indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be
estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material,
would be disclosed.  

Loss
contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would
be disclosed.  

Revenue
Recognition    

The
Company applies paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company recognizes
revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all
of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the
services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably
assured.  

The
Company derives its revenues from sales contracts with its customer with revenues being generated upon rendering of services.
Persuasive evidence of an arrangement is demonstrated via invoice; service is considered provided when the service is delivered
to the customers; and the sales price to the customer is fixed upon acceptance of the purchase order and there is no separate
sales rebate, discount, or volume incentive.  

Equity
Instruments Issued to Parties Other Than Employees for Acquiring Goods or Services    

The
Company accounts for equity instruments issued to parties other than employees for acquiring goods or services under the guidance
of Sub-topic 505-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( Sub-topic 505-50 ).

   September

   Notes
to the Financial Statements   

   (Unaudited)   

Pursuant
to ASC paragraph 505-50-25-7, if fully vested, non-forfeitable equity instruments are issued at the date the grantor and grantee
enter into an agreement for goods or services (no specific performance is required by the grantee to retain those equity instruments),
then, because of the elimination of any obligation on the part of the counterparty to earn the equity instruments, a measurement
date has been reached. A grantor shall recognize the equity instruments when they are issued (in most cases, when the agreement
is entered into). Whether the corresponding cost is an immediate expense or a prepaid asset (or whether the debit should be characterized
as contra-equity under the requirements of paragraph 505-50-45-1) depends on the specific facts and circumstances. Pursuant to
ASC paragraph 505-50-45-1, a grantor may conclude that an asset (other than a note or a receivable) has been received in return
for fully vested, non-forfeitable equity instruments that are issued at the date the grantor and grantee enter into an agreement
for goods or services (and no specific performance is required by the grantee in order to retain those equity instruments). Such
an asset shall not be displayed as contra-equity by the grantor of the equity instruments. The transferability (or lack thereof)
of the equity instruments shall not affect the balance sheet display of the asset. This guidance is limited to transactions in
which equity instruments are transferred to other than employees in exchange for goods or services.  

Pursuant
to Paragraphs 505-50-25-8 and 505-50-25-9, an entity may grant fully vested, non-forfeitable equity instruments that are exercisable
by the grantee only after a specified period of time if the terms of the agreement provide for earlier exercisability if the grantee
achieves specified performance conditions. Any measured cost of the transaction shall be recognized in the same period(s) and
in the same manner as if the entity had paid cash for the goods or services or used cash rebates as a sales discount instead of
paying with, or using, the equity instruments. A recognized asset, expense, or sales discount shall not be reversed if a stock
option that the counterparty has the right to exercise expires unexercised.  

Pursuant
to ASC Paragraphs 505-50-30-2 and 505-50-30-11 share-based payment transactions with non-employees shall be measured at the fair
value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.
The issuer shall measure the fair value of the equity instruments in these transactions using the stock price and other measurement
assumptions as of the earlier of the following dates, referred to as the measurement date: (a) The date at which a commitment
for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached (a performance commitment); or (b) The date at which
the counterparty s performance is complete. If the Company s common shares are traded in one of the national exchanges
the grant-date share price of the Company s common stock will be used to measure the fair value of the common shares issued,
however, if the Company s common shares are thinly traded the use of share prices established in the Company s most
recent private placement memorandum ( PPM ), or weekly or monthly price observations would generally be more appropriate
than the use of daily price observations as such shares could be artificially inflated due to a larger spread between the bid
and asked quotes and lack of consistent trading in the market.  

Pursuant
to ASC Paragraph 718-10-55-21 if an observable market price is not available for a share option or similar instrument with the
same or similar terms and conditions, an entity shall estimate the fair value of that instrument using a valuation technique or
model that meets the requirements in paragraph 718-10-55-11 and takes into account, at a minimum, all of the following factors:  

a.  
      The
    exercise price of the option.   

b.  
      The
    expected term of the option, taking into account both the contractual term of the option and the effects of employees 
    expected exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior: Pursuant to Paragraph 718-10-50-2(f)(2)(i) of the FASB
    Accounting Standards Codification the expected term of share options and similar instruments represents the period of time
    the options and similar instruments are expected to be outstanding taking into consideration of the contractual term of the
    instruments and holder s expected exercise behavior into the fair value (or calculated value) of the instruments. The
    Company uses historical data to estimate holder s expected exercise behavior. If the Company is a newly formed corporation
    or shares of the Company are thinly traded the contractual term of the share options and similar instruments is used as the
    expected term of share options and similar instruments as the Company does not have sufficient historical exercise data to
    provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term.   

c.  
      The
    current price of the underlying share.   

d.  
      The
    expected volatility of the price of the underlying share for the expected term of the option. Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 718-10-55-25
    a newly publicly traded entity might base expectations about future volatility on the average volatilities of similar entities
    for an appropriate period following their going public. A nonpublic entity might base its expected volatility on the average
    volatilities of otherwise similar public entities. For purposes of identifying otherwise similar entities, an entity would
    likely consider characteristics such as industry, stage of life cycle, size, and financial leverage. Because of the effects
    of diversification that are present in an industry sector index, the volatility of an index should not be substituted for
    the average of volatilities of otherwise similar entities in a fair value measurement. Pursuant to paragraph 718-10-S99-1
    if shares of a company are thinly traded the use of weekly or monthly price observations would generally be more appropriate
    than the use of daily price observations as the volatility calculation using daily observations for such shares could be artificially
    inflated due to a larger spread between the bid and asked quotes and lack of consistent trading in the market. The Company
    uses the average historical volatility of the comparable companies over the expected term of the share options or similar
    instruments as its expected volatility.

e.  
      The
    expected dividends on the underlying share for the expected term of the option. The expected dividend yield is based on the

    of the share options and similar instruments.   

f.  
      The
    risk-free interest rate(s) for the expected term of the option. Pursuant to ASC 718-10-55-28 a U.S. entity issuing an option
    on its own shares must use as the risk-free interest rates the implied yields currently available from the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon
    yield curve over the contractual term of the option if the entity is using a lattice model incorporating the option s
    contractual term. If the entity is using a closed-form model, the risk-free interest rate is the implied yield currently available
    on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term used as the assumption in the model.   

Pursuant
to ASC paragraph 505-50-S99-1, if the Company receives a right to receive future services in exchange for unvested, forfeitable
equity instruments, those equity instruments are treated as unissued for accounting purposes until the future services are received
(that is, the instruments are not considered issued until they vest). Consequently, there would be no recognition at the measurement
date and no entry should be recorded.  

Stock-Based
Compensation    

The
Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718,   Compensation   Stock Compensation . 
FASB ASC Topic 718 requires companies to measure compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation at fair value at the
grant date and recognize the expense over the employee s requisite service period. The Company recognizes in the statement
of operations the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation issued to employees and non-employees.
There were 6,000,000 options outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

Research
and Development    

The
Company follows paragraph 730-10-25-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (formerly Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 2,   Accounting for Research and Development Costs  ) and paragraph 730-20-25-11 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification (formerly Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 68   Research and Development Arrangements  )
for research and development costs. Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. Research and development
costs consist primarily of remuneration for research and development staff, depreciation and maintenance expenses of research
and development equipment, material and testing costs for research and development as well as research and development arrangements
with unrelated third party research and development institutions.  

Deferred
Tax Assets and Income Tax Provision    

The
Company accounts for income taxes under Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, which requires recognition
of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial
statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial
statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are
expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely
than not that the assets will not be realized.  

Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in
tax rates is recognized in the statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.

   (Unaudited)   

The
Company adopted the provisions of paragraph 740-10-25-13 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Paragraph 740-10-25-13
addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the
financial statements. Under paragraph 740-10-25-13, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only
if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical
merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based
on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Paragraph
740-10-25-13 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim
periods and requires increased disclosures.  

The
estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying
balance sheets, as well as tax credit carry-backs and carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred
tax assets recorded on its balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary.  

Management
makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous
estimates of tax liability. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in
these jurisdictions. In management s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. If actual
taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates, additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary.  

Tax
years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions    

The
Company discloses tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions pursuant to the ASC Paragraph 740-10-50-15.  

The
tax years from December 31, 2012 thru December 31, 2015 remain subject to tax examination.  

Earnings
per Share    

Earnings
Per Share ( EPS ) is the amount of earnings attributable to each share of common stock. For convenience, the term
is used to refer to either earnings or loss per share. EPS is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification. Pursuant to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-10 through 260-10-45-16 Basic EPS shall be computed by dividing income available
to common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the
period. Income available to common stockholders shall be computed by deducting both the dividends declared in the period on preferred
stock (whether or not paid) and the dividends accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned)
from income from continuing operations (if that amount appears in the income statement) and also from net income. The computation
of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional
common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued during the period to reflect
the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement, stock options
or warrants.  

Pursuant
to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-45-21 through 260-10-45-45-23 Diluted EPS shall be based on the most advantageous conversion rate
or exercise price from the standpoint of the security holder. The dilutive effect of outstanding call options and warrants (and
their equivalents) issued by the reporting entity shall be reflected in diluted EPS by application of the treasury stock method
unless the provisions of paragraphs 260-10-45-35 through 45-36 and 260-10-55-8 through 55-11 require that another method be applied.
Equivalents of options and warrants include non-vested stock granted to employees, stock purchase contracts, and partially paid
stock subscriptions (see paragraph 260-10-55-23). Anti-dilutive contracts, such as purchased put options and purchased call options,
shall be excluded from diluted EPS. Under the treasury stock method: a. Exercise of options and warrants shall be assumed at the
beginning of the period (or at time of issuance, if later) and common shares shall be assumed to be issued. b. The proceeds from
exercise shall be assumed to be used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. (See paragraphs 260-10-45-29
and 260-10-55-4 through 55-5.) c. The incremental shares (the difference between the number of shares assumed issued and the number
of shares assumed purchased) shall be included in the denominator of the diluted EPS computation.  

The
computation of basic and diluted loss per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 excludes the common stock
equivalents of the following potentially dilutive securities because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive (the number of potentially
dilutive securities issuable upon conversion of our convertible debt with a variable conversion rate is computed using the market
price of our common stock during as of the last trading day of September 30, 2016):

Cash
Flows Reporting    

The
Company adopted paragraph 230-10-45-24 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for cash flows reporting, classifies cash
receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and provides definitions
of each category, and uses the indirect or reconciliation method ( Indirect method ) as defined by paragraph 230-10-45-25
of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile
it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and
payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income
that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments. The Company reports the reporting currency equivalent of foreign currency
cash flows, using the current exchange rate at the time of the cash flows and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash held
in foreign currencies is reported as a separate item in the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents
and separately provides information about investing and financing activities not resulting in cash receipts or payments in the
period pursuant to paragraph 830-230-45-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.  

Subsequent
Events    

The
Company follows the guidance in Section 855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent
events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the date when the financial statements were issued. Pursuant to ASU
2010-09 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the Company as an SEC filer considers its financial statements issued when
they are widely distributed to users, such as through filing them on EDGAR.

In
May 2014, the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606)  ( ASU 2014-09 )   

This
guidance amends the existing FASB Accounting Standards Codification, creating a new Topic 606,  Revenue from Contracts with
Customer.  The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised
goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange
for those goods or services.  

To
achieve that core principle, an entity should apply the following steps:  

1.  
      Identify
    the contract(s) with the customer   

2.  
      Identify
    the performance obligations in the contract

The
ASU also provides guidance on disclosures that should be provided to enable financial statement users to understand the nature,
amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue recognition and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Qualitative and quantitative
information is required about the following:  

1.  
       Contracts
    with customers  - including revenue and impairments recognized, disaggregation of revenue, and information about contract
    balances and performance obligations (including the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations)   

2.  
       Significant
    judgments and changes in judgments  - determining the timing of satisfaction of performance obligations (over time or at
    a point in time), and determining the transaction price and amounts allocated to performance obligations.

    recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract.

In
June 2014, the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-12   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718) :
 Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the
Requisite Service Period  ( ASU 2014-12 ).   

The
amendments clarify the proper method of accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance
target could be achieved after the requisite service period. The Update requires that a performance target that affects vesting
and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. The performance target should
not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation cost should be recognized in the period in
which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable
to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered.  

The
amendments in this Update are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December
15, 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted and the Company has elected to implement the guidance in its quarter ended September 30,
2014.  

In
August 2014, the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15  Presentation of Financial Statements-Going
Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU
2014-15 ).  

In
connection with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, an entity s management should
evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity s
ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one
year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). Management s evaluation should
be based on relevant conditions and events that are known and reasonably knowable at the date that the financial statements are
issued (or at the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). Substantial doubt about an entity s
ability to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate that
it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the
financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The term probable is used consistently with its use in Topic 450,
Contingencies.  

When
management identifies conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going
concern, management should consider whether its plans that are intended to mitigate those relevant conditions or events will alleviate
the substantial doubt. The mitigating effect of management s plans should be considered only to the extent that (1) it is
probable that the plans will be effectively implemented and, if so, (2) it is probable that the plans will mitigate the conditions
or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern.

If
conditions or events raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, and substantial doubt
is not alleviated after consideration of management s plans, an entity should include a statement in the footnotes indicating
that there is substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date

to Equity  ( ASU 2014-16 ).  The amendments in ASU No. 2014-16 clarify that an entity must take into account
all relevant terms and features when reviewing the nature of the host contract. Additionally, the amendments state that no one
term or feature would define the host contract s economic characteristics and risks. Instead, the economic characteristics
and risks of the hybrid financial instrument as a whole would determine the nature of the host contract. The amendments in this
Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after

   (Unaudited)   

As
reflected in the financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $4,255,784 at September 30, 2016, a net loss
of $2,926,997 and net cash used in operating activities of $764,382 for the reporting period then ended  . These factors
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

The
Company is attempting to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue; however, its cash position may not
be sufficient to support its daily operations. The Company is currently integrating higher search engine optimization rankings
thru organic growth via our existing customer base. By growing and utilizing our customer base we will slowly introduce
paid options and extended storage fees. We anticipate that these options will be integrated in Q2 2017. Paid subscriptions will
also be offered for more advanced options in conjunction with other providers that complement and enhance our platform. While
the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and
in its ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering, there can be no assurances to that effect. The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to further implement its business plan and
generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering.  

The
financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts
or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  

Note
4   Note Payable   

On
July 20, 2015 the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the  SPA ) with Glamis Capital SA ( Glamis ),
whereby Glamis agreed to invest $200,000 (the  Purchase Price ) in our Company in exchange for the Note (as defined
below). Pursuant to the SPA, we issued a promissory note to Glamis on July 20, 2015 (the  Issuance Date ) in the original
principal amount of $200,000.00, which bears interest at 10% per annum (the  Note ).  

The
Purchase Price for the Note was funded as follows: (1) $70,000 on the Issuance Date and $65,000 on August 24, 2015. The principal
from each funding date, coupled with the accrued and unpaid interest relating to that principal amount, is due and payable one
year from the respective funding date (each a  Maturity Date ). Any amount of principal or interest that is due under
the Note, which is not paid by the respective Maturity Date, will bear interest at 14% per annum until it is paid. The Note can
be prepaid by the Company at any time while the Note is outstanding. In the event that the Company closes a future financing of
at least $1,000,000 while the Note is outstanding, the Company would become obligated to pay all amounts outstanding under the
Note within a reasonable time after such closing.  

On
November 12, 2015, the Company amended the SPA it entered into with Glamis to limit the amount Glamis is obligated to advance
to the Company under the Glamis Note to $135,000 and amend the Note to reflect a principal balance of $135,000 after giving effect
to an August 24,2015 payment by Glamis to the Company of $65,000 under the Note. No further advances will be made by Glamis to
the Company under the Note.  

On
March 1, 2016 the Company finalized a settlement of debt owed to Glamis Capital SA through a conversion into common stock of the
Company. The total debt of $135,000 plus accrued and unpaid interest of $7,403 for a total of $142,403 was converted into 1,808,288
common stock par value $.0001 based on an average of the previous 20 days close price of the common stock of the company discounted
by 25% for a price of $.074875 per share. The loss on extinguishment of this debt was determined to be $354,876 based on the date
of the debt settlement agreement of February 24, 2016 and the closing stock price on that date to be $.0275.  

Securities
Purchase Agreement and Convertible Notes Issued to Old Main Capital, LLC   

On
March 9, 2016 (the  Issuance Date ) we closed on the transaction contemplated by the securities purchase agreement
(the  SPA ) we entered into with Old Main Capital, LLC ( Old Main ), whereby Old Main agreed to purchase
from the Company a convertible promissory note (the  March 2016 Note ) in the original principal amount of $296,153
for $269,500, net of an original issuance discount of $26,653 (the  Purchase Price ). The March 2016 Note bears interest
at the rate of 10% per annum. The Purchase Price will be paid as follows: (i) $84,500 was paid in cash to us on March 12, 2016
(ii) $100,000 was paid in cash to us on April 6, 2016 (iii) $85,000 was paid in cash to us on May 6, 2016. The principal from
each funding date and the accrued and unpaid interest relating to that principal amount is due and payable on March 9, 2017 (the
 Maturity Date ). Any amount of principal or interest that is due under the March 2016 Note which is not paid by the
Maturity Date will bear interest at the rate of 24% per annum until it is paid and subject to further increase as discussed below.  

Beginning
6 months after the Issuance Date, we are required to make bi-weekly amortization payments (one payment every 2 weeks), consisting
of 1/12 th  of the outstanding principal and interest, until the March 2016 Note is no longer outstanding (each a  Bi-Weekly
Payment ). Such Bi-Weekly Payments may be made in cash, or in our common stock ( Common Stock ) if certain equity
conditions are satisfied. Such equity conditions include but are not limited to an average daily dollar volume of the Common Stock
greater than $30,000 for the 20 trading days prior to a Bi-Weekly Payment. If the equity conditions are satisfied, and we decide
to make a Bi-Weekly payment in Common Stock, then the shares of Common Stock to be delivered shall be calculated as follows: the
amount of the Bi-Weekly Payment divided by the Base Conversion Price (as defined below). The Base Conversion Price shall equal
the lower of (i) the closing price of the Common Stock on March 9, 2016, or (ii) 70% of the lowest VWAP of the Common Stock for
the 15 trading days immediately prior to the date of the Bi-Weekly Payment.

The
March 2016 Note can be prepaid by us at any time while the March 2016 Note is outstanding, at a prepayment price of 125% multiplied
by the outstanding principal and interest of the March 2016 Note, subject to Old Main s discretionary acceptance. If an
event of default occurs under the March 2016 Note, which is not cured within three business days, then upon Old Main s provision
of notice to the Company of the occurrence of such event of default, the Company shall within three business days of such default
notice, pay the total amount outstanding under the March 2016 Note in cash (including principal, accrued and unpaid interest,
applicable penalties (including default multipliers). In the event that the Company does not pay the total amount outstanding
within three (3) business days of such default notice, then the total amount outstanding under the March 2016 Note (post-default
amount) at that time shall increase by 50%, and on the fourth business day after such default notice (the  Second Amortization
Payment Date ), the Company shall begin to make weekly amortization payments (for the avoidance of doubt, weekly shall mean
every week) (each a  Weekly Payment ), in (1) cash to Old Main or (2) Common Stock at a price per share equal to the
lesser of (i) the closing price of our common stock on March 9, 2016 or (ii) 52% of the lowest VWAP of the Common Stock for the
15 consecutive Trading Days ending on the Trading Day that is immediately prior to the applicable conversion date. Each Weekly
Payment shall consist of the greater of (i) $10,000.00 of value under the March 2016 Note or (ii) 1/24th of the total outstanding
amount under this March 2016 Note as of the Second Amortization Payment Date, including the principal, accrued and unpaid interest
(prorated through the entire pay-off period), and any applicable penalties.  

On
June 9, 2016 we amended the March 2016 Note whereby we revised the note to remove the equity condition limitations, removed the
amortization payment requirements and to permit voluntary conversions in common stock. We also revised the conversion price to
mean the lesser of (a) the closing price of our common stock on March 9, 2016 or (b) 60% of the lowest VWAP price of our common
stock for the 15 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day that is immediately prior to any applicable conversion date.
The amendment was accounted for using the extinguishment of debt method. We recorded an $88,956 loss on extinguishment of debt.  

On
June 9, 2016 (the  Issuance Date ) we closed on the transaction contemplated by the securities purchase agreement

net of an original issuance discount of $7,912 (the  Purchase Price ). The Note bears interest at the rate of 10%
per annum. The Purchase Price was paid on June 9, 2016 in cash. The principal from the funding date and the accrued and unpaid
interest relating to that principal amount is due and payable on June 9, 2017 (the  Maturity Date ). Any amount of
principal or interest that is due under the Note which is not paid by the Maturity Date will bear interest at the rate of 24%

price of our common stock on June 9, 2016 or (b) 60% of the lowest VWAP price of our common stock for the 15 consecutive trading
days ending on the trading day that is immediately prior to any applicable conversion date. As at September 30, 2016 the Company
owes $87,912 in principal and $4,396 in accrued interest.  

Equity
Line of Credit   

On
March 9, 2016, we issued an 8% convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $250,000 to Old Main as a commitment fee
for entering into a term sheet whereby Old Main agreed to provide us with up to $5,000,000 in financing over a 24 month period
through the purchase of our common stock. The proposed equity line will be subject to certain conditions, including, but not limited
to, our filing of a Registration Statement covering the resale of the securities issued to Old Main and our continued compliance
with the disclosure requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Old Main s commitment to provide
funding under the equity line of credit is subject to us entering into a definitive and binding agreement related to the proposed
equity line of credit and as of September 30, 2016 we have not entered into any such agreement.  

The
terms and conditions of the $250,000 note are substantially identical to the March 2016 Note except the interest rate which is
8% per annum, half of which is guaranteed and the total amount of interest due on the Note for a period of six months is deemed
earned as of the date the note was issued. All interest payments will be payable in cash, or subject to certain equity conditions
in cash or common stock in the Company s discretion. Accrued and unpaid interest shall be due on payable on each conversion
date and on the date the note matures, or as otherwise provided for in the note.  

Beginning
six months after the date of the note, the Company is required to begin to make bi-weekly amortization payments (for the avoidance
of doubt, bi-weekly shall mean every two weeks), in cash to Old Main until the note is repaid in full. Each bi-weekly payment
shall consist of at least 1/12th of the total outstanding amount under the note as of the amortization payment date, including
the principal, accrued and unpaid interest (prorated through the entire pay-off period pursuant to this paragraph), and any applicable
penalties. The Company may make a bi-weekly payment to Old Main in the Company s common stock, in the event that the equity
conditions provided for in the note are satisfied. The maturity date of the note is March 9, 2017.

Securities
Purchase Agreement and Convertible Note Issued to SBI Investments LLC, 2014-1   

On
June 30, 2016 (the  Issuance Date ) we closed on the transaction contemplated by the securities purchase agreement
(the  SPA ) we entered into with SBI Investments LLC, 2014-1 ( SBI ), whereby SBI agreed to purchase from
the Company a convertible promissory note (the  Note ) in the original principal amount of $550,000 for $500,000 net
of an original issuance discount of $50,000 (the  Purchase Price ). The Note bears interest at the rate of 8% per
annum. The Purchase Price was paid on June 30, 2016 in cash. The principal from the funding date and the accrued and unpaid interest
relating to that principal amount is due and payable on June 30, 2017 (the  Maturity Date ). Any amount of principal
or interest that is due under the Note which is not paid by the Maturity Date will bear interest at the rate of 24% per annum
until it is paid and subject to further increase as discussed below. The conversion price is the lesser of (a) the closing price
of our common stock on June 30, 2016 ($0.08 per share) or (b) 60% of the lowest VWAP price of our common stock for the 20 consecutive
trading days ending on the trading day that is immediately prior to any applicable conversion date. The principal from each funding
date and the accrued and unpaid interest relating to that principal amount is due and payable on June 9, 2017 (the  Maturity
Date ). Any amount of principal or interest that is due under the Note which is not paid by the Maturity Date will bear
interest at the rate of 24% per annum until it is paid and subject to further increase as discussed below. This convertible debt
has been accounted for as a derivative liability and is included in the Note 5 derivative liability calculations below.  

Beginning
6 months after the Issuance Date, we are required to make bi-weekly amortization payments (one payment every 2 weeks), consisting
of 1/12 th  of the outstanding principal and interest, until the Note is no longer outstanding (each a  Bi-Weekly
Payment ). Such Bi-Weekly Payments may be made in cash, or in our common stock ( Common Stock ) if certain equity
conditions are satisfied. Such equity conditions include but are not limited to an average daily dollar volume of the Common Stock
greater than $25,000 for the 20 trading days prior to a Bi-Weekly Payment. If the equity conditions are satisfied, and we decide
to make a Bi-Weekly payment in Common Stock, then the shares of Common Stock to be delivered shall be calculated as follows: the
amount of the Bi-Weekly Payment divided by the Base Conversion Price (as defined below). The Base Conversion Price shall equal
the lower of (i) the closing price of the Common Stock on June 30, 2016, $.08 per share, or (ii) 60% of the lowest VWAP of the
Common Stock for the 20 trading days immediately prior to the date of the Bi-Weekly Payment.  

The
Note can be prepaid by us at any time while the Note is outstanding, at a prepayment price of 125% multiplied by the outstanding
principal and interest of the Note, subject to SBI s discretionary acceptance. If an event of default occurs under the Note,
which is not cured within three business days, then upon SBI s provision of notice to the Company of the occurrence of such
event of default, the Company shall within three business days of such default notice, pay the total amount outstanding under
the Note in cash (including principal, accrued and unpaid interest, applicable penalties (including default multipliers). In the
event that the Company does not pay the total amount outstanding within three (3) business days of such default notice, the company
will pay interest at 24%. As at September 30, 2016 the Company owes $550,000 in principal and $22,000 in accrued interest.  

Note
5   Derivative Liability   

In
connection with the sale of debt or equity instruments, the Company may sell options or warrants to purchase our common stock.
In certain circumstances, these options or warrants may be classified as derivative liabilities, rather than as equity. Additionally,
the debt or equity instruments may contain embedded derivative instruments, such as embedded derivative features which in certain
circumstances may be required to be bifurcated from the associated host instrument and accounted for separately as a derivative
instrument liability.  

The
Company s derivative instrument liabilities are re-valued at the end of each reporting period, with changes in the fair
value of the derivative liability recorded as charges or credits to income in the period in which the changes occur. For options,
warrants and bifurcated embedded derivative features that are accounted for as derivative instrument liabilities, the Company
estimates fair value using either quoted market prices of financial instruments with similar characteristics or other valuation
techniques. The valuation techniques require assumptions related to the remaining term of the instruments and risk-free rates
of return, our current common stock price and expected dividend yield, and the expected volatility of our common stock price over
the life of the instrument.

The
following table summarizes the warrant derivative liabilities and convertible notes activity for the period ending September 30,
2016:  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net derivative expense was $173,120  

The
lattice methodology was used to value the embedded derivatives within the convertible note and the warrants issued, with the following
assumptions.  

During
the period ending March 31, 2016, the Company amended the derivative notes on March 9, 2016. The amendment included revising the
 Alternate Conversion Price to mean 60% of the lowest traded price of the common stock for the 15 consecutive trading days
prior to the conversion date. The derivative liability increased by $91,070 due to the amendment which was booked as an additional
debt discount.  

During
the quarter ending September 30, 2015, the Company issued 850,000 warrants to an investor as part of their Securities Purchase
Agreement in which the investor acquired a Convertible Note. The warrants have an exercise price of $0.2625 and a five-year term.
The warrants are treated as derivative liabilities since the holder has anti-dilution protections that will re-price the warrant
upon the issuance of lower priced equity linked instruments by the Company for the period of 180 days after issuance. The fair
value of the derivative liability related to these warrants at issuance was valued at $169,270 and was booked as a debt discount
to the Convertible Note and booked as a derivative liability on the balance sheet. The embedded conversion feature of the Convertible
Note is treated as a derivative liability since the conversion price is reset upon a fundamental transaction event. The fair value
of the derivative liability related to the embedded conversion feature was valued at $92,659 and was booked as a debt discount
(up to the amount of the note, with the excess expensed as interest expense).

to us on the Issuance Date, (2) the remaining $200,000 within 30 days after the Issuance Date. The principal from each funding
date, coupled with the accrued and unpaid interest relating to that principal amount, is due and payable on September 8, 2016
(the  Maturity Date ). Any amount of principal or interest that is due under the September 2015 Note, which is not
paid by the Maturity Date, will bear interest at the rate of 24% per annum until it is paid.

of 1/12 th  of the outstanding principal and interest, until the September 2015 Note is on longer outstanding (each a
 Bi-Weekly Payment ). Such Bi-Weekly Payments may be made in cash, or in our common stock ( Common Stock )
if certain equity conditions are satisfied. Such equity conditions include but are not limited to an average daily dollar volume
of the Common Stock greater than $25,000 for the 20 trading days prior to a Bi-Weekly Payment. If the equity conditions are satisfied,
and we decide to make a Bi-Weekly payment in Common Stock, then the shares of Common Stock to be delivered shall be calculated
as follows: the amount of the Bi-Weekly Payment divided by the Base Conversion Price (as defined below). The Base Conversion Price
shall equal the lower of (i) the closing price of the Common Stock on September 8, 2015, or (ii) 70% of the average of the lowest
VWAP of the Common Stock for the 15 trading days immediately prior to the date of the Bi-Weekly Payment. Additionally, Old Main
has the right at any time to convert amounts owed under the September 2015 Note into Common Stock at the closing price of the
Common Stock on September 8, 2015. If an event of default under the September 2015 Note occurs, Old Main has the right to convert
amounts owed under the September 2015 Note into Common Stock at 52% multiplied by the lowest VWAP of the Common Stock for the
15 trading days immediately prior to the applicable conversion date.  

The
September 2015 Note can be prepaid by us at any time while the September 2015 Note is outstanding, at a prepayment price of 125%
multiplied by the outstanding principal and interest of the September 2015 Note, subject to Old Main s discretionary acceptance.
If an event of default occurs under the September 2015 Note, which is not cured within 10 business days, Old Main has the option
to require our redemption of the September 2015 Note in cash at a redemption price of 130% multiplied by the outstanding principal
and interest of the September 2015 Note. The September 2015 Note contains representations, warranties, events of default, beneficial
ownership limitations, and other provisions that are customary of similar instruments.  

Effective
on March 9, 2016, the September 2015 Note was amended whereby the conversion price in effect on any Conversion Date shall be equal
to the lesser of the (i) closing price of the Common Stock on September 8, 2015 ( Fixed Conversion Price ), or (ii)
60% of the lowest traded price of the Common Stock for the 15 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day that is immediately
prior to the applicable Conversion Date. All such determinations will be appropriately adjusted for any stock dividend, stock
split, stock combination, reclassification or similar transaction that proportionately decreases or increases the Common Stock
during such measuring period. This amendment triggered an extinguishment of the debt since the change in the fair value of the
embedded derivative exceeded 10% of the carrying value of the debt. The Company booked a $144,205 loss on extinguishment based
on the amendment.  

The
Company has converted $473,684 of principal and $28,033 of interest for 8,509,360 shares ranging in price per share of $.039 to
..085 to September 30, 2016. This loan has been completely paid off by July 22, 2016.  

In
conjunction with the issuance of the September 2015 Note, we simultaneously issued 850,000 common stock purchase warrants to Old
Main (the  Warrants ). The Warrants may be exercised by Old Main at any time in the 5-year period following the issuance.
The exercise price for each share of the Common Stock is equal to the closing price of the Common Stock on September 8, 2015,
$0.2625 per share.

Following
is an analysis of convertible debt issued to Old Main Capital and SBI Investments at September 30, 2016:  

The
above amount does not include accrued interest to September 30, 2016 of $54,515 which is included with Accounts payable and accrued
expenses.  

This
note is a derivative because it contains an embedded conversion feature that resets the conversion price upon a fundamental transaction
event. The Company recorded a debt discount based on the original issue discount, the embedded derivative, and the derivative
warrant issued. The debt discount is being amortized over the term of the convertible debt.  

Note
7 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments.   

The
Company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, warrants and
convertible debt. The estimated fair value of cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their carrying amounts
due to the short-term nature of these instruments.  

The
Company utilizes various types of financing to fund its business needs, including convertible debt with warrants attached. The
Company reviews its warrants and conversion features of securities issued as to whether they are freestanding or contain an embedded
derivative and, if so, whether they are classified as a liability at each reporting period until the amount is settled and reclassified
into equity with changes in fair value recognized in current earnings. At September 30, 2016, the Company had convertible debt
and warrants to purchase common stock. The fair value of the warrants and the embedded conversion feature of the convertible debt
is classified as a liability. Some of these units have embedded conversion features that are treated as a discount on the notes.
Such financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value and amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt using
the effective interest method.

Inputs
used in the valuation to derive fair value are classified based on a fair value hierarchy which distinguishes between assumptions
based on market data (observable inputs) and an entity s own assumptions (unobservable inputs). The hierarchy consists of
three levels:  

Level
one   Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;  

Level
two   Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and  

Level
three   Unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions, which are developed by the reporting entity and reflect
those assumptions that a market participant would use.  

Determining
which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment. The Company evaluates its hierarchy
disclosures each quarter. The Company s derivative liability is measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company
classifies the fair value of these convertible notes and warrants derivative liability under level three. The Company s
settlement payable is measured at fair value on a recurring basis based on the most recent settlement offer. The Company classifies
the fair value of the settlement payable under level three. The Company s rescission liability is measured at fair value
on a recurring basis based on the most recent stock price. The Company classifies the fair value of the rescission liability under
level one.

on ASC Topic 815 and related guidance, the Company concluded the common stock purchase warrants are required to be accounted for
as derivatives as of the issue date due to a reset feature on the exercise price. At the date of issuance warrant derivative liabilities
were measured at fair value using either quoted market prices of financial instruments with similar characteristics or other valuation
techniques. The Company records the fair value of these derivatives on its balance sheet at fair value with changes in the values
of these derivatives reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as  Gain (loss) on derivative liabilities. 
These derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815-10 and are disclosed on the balance sheet
under Derivative Liabilities.  

The
following table presents liabilities that are measured and recognized at fair value as of September 30, 2016 on a recurring and
non-recurring basis:  

There
were no transfers between the fair value levels.

Note
10 - Acquisition of Assets   

On
November 10, 2015, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the  Asset Purchase Agreement ) with Pixorial,
Inc. (the  Seller ), pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase, and the Seller agreed to sell, Pixorial s
assets (the  Pixorial Asset Acquisition ), which are comprised of source code, software, trade secrets, processes,
ideas, know-how, improvements, discoveries, developments, designs, techniques and contract rights related to the Pixorial app,
including but not limited to contract rights related to the Pixorial app for inclusion on the Apple store and the Google Play
store. Pixorial s software offers online user-friendly tools and applications to access, download, edit, tag, process, store,
organize and share videos, photos and music from any device, services which we plan to integrate with our existing software.  

Under
the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to issue 3,200,000 shares of its unregistered common stock to the
existing shareholders and certain creditors of Pixorial, and, pending the closing, to enter into a consulting agreement with Andres
Espineira (the  Espineira Consulting Agreement ), Pixorial s founder and Chief Executive Officer, the duration
of which will be 40 months from the date of the Asset Purchase Agreement. Under the terms of the Espineira Consulting Agreement,
Mr. Espineira will be responsible for leading the integration team that will be engaged in the development of the enhancements
to the Company s existing life-logging software tools by incorporating the tools developed by Pixorial. The Espineira Consulting
Agreement provides for the Company s payment to him of $8,000 per month and awards him stock options to acquire 6,000,000
shares of the Company s common stock exercisable at the market price of the common stock as of October 31, 2015, one-third
the number of which may be sold beginning as of each of the first three anniversaries of November 1, 2015. The shares to be issued
to Pixorial s shareholders will also be subject to a lock-up agreement whereby one-third the number received by each may
be sold beginning as of each of the first three anniversaries of the closing of the Pixorial Asset Acquisition.  

Additionally,
under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company and Pixorial have entered into a licensing agreement effective as
of November 1, 2015 (the  Pixorial License Agreement ) whereby the Company has licensed the exclusive use of certain
of Pixorial s software, source code, software, trade secrets, processes, ideas, know-how, improvements, discoveries, developments,
designs, techniques and contract rights related to the Licensor s Pixorial app (the  Pixorial Software ). The
duration of the Pixorial License Agreement is the earlier of twelve months or the closing of the transactions under the Asset
Purchase Agreement.  

The
Asset Purchase Agreement was closed on June 30, 2016 whereby the Company issued 2,600,200 shares of common stock. The common stock
was valued at $195,015 based on the closing price of $.075/share of the Company s common stock on the acquisition date.
The purchase price was allocated as follows: trademark - $5,000 and customer list - $190,015. Management determined that these
intangible assets were impaired and took a charge to earnings of $195,015 during the period ended June 30, 2016.  

Note
11 - Subsequent Events   

The
Company has evaluated all events that occurred after the balance sheet date through the date when the financial statements were
issued to determine if they must be reported. The Management of the Company determined that the following event occurred subsequent
to September 30, 2016:  

On

  conversion
price of $.0406 per share.  

On
November 7, 2016 $5,000 of the Company s convertible debt was converted to 168,011  shares of common stock at a  

  conversion
price of $.02796 per share.  

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.   

FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS   

This
report contains forward-looking statements. The Securities and Exchange Commission encourages companies to disclose forward-looking
information so that investors can better understand a company s future prospects and make informed investment decisions.
This report and other written and oral statements that we make from time to time contain such forward-looking statements that
set out anticipated results based on management s plans and assumptions regarding future events or performance. We have
tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such as  anticipate,   estimate, 
 expect,   project,   intend,   plan,   believe,   will 
and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include
statements relating to future actions, future performance or results of current and anticipated sales efforts, expenses, the outcome
of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. Factors that could cause our actual results of operations
and financial condition to differ materially are discussed in greater detail in the  Risk Factors  section of our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC on April 8, 2016.   

We
caution that the factors described herein and other factors could cause our actual results of operations and financial condition
to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements we make and that investors should not place undue
reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such
statement is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after
the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances.
New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of such factors. Further, we cannot assess
the impact of each such factor on our results of operations or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may
cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.   

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear
elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.  

The
Company    

We
are a lifelogging software company engaged in the development and commercialization of innovative lifelogging solutions enabling
the recording, secure online storage, organizing, retrieving, appreciation and selective sharing of personal information, data,
photos, videos and other activities with friends and the public at large. We developed a proprietary cloud-based software solution
accessible on iOS and Android devices that offers an enhanced media experience for consumers by augmenting videos, livestreams
and photos with additional context information and providing a platform that makes it easy to find and use that data when viewing
or sharing media. The first iteration of that context information is focused on geo-location, face-detection, and different options
for tagging and social interaction.  

Our
Core Business    

Lifelogging
is a way of journaling one s life using media, often through the use of wearable electronic devices. We make lifelogging
accessible to the mass market by taking videos and images right from users  smart phones, wearable camera and/or sensor
solutions, and adding geographic, visual and test data designed to enhance the relevance and context of the information collected.
We make it easier for users to retrieve and share their media with family and friends without having to be an expert in using
advanced functions in real time, using live stream or recording, at the user s option. We allow consumers to easily capture
and live stream videos with geographic coordinates and automatic face detection and to tag special moments while recording. The
video playback features an interactive map and ability to skip to in-video frames with faces detected and added tags. Search features
allow users the ability to retrieve videos beyond the basic title and description, including location, face or in-line video tags.
Sharing videos on popular social channels like Facebook and Twitter using links makes it easy to manage large media files.  

Our
vision is to seamlessly integrate with a wide range of wearable cameras and mobile devices. To realize this vision, our plan is
to integrate with selected leading camera manufacturers. We refer to this integrated eco-system as the LifeLogger Platform. In
addition, we plan to offer our LifeLogger Platform on a  white-label  license basis to device manufacturers and leading
companies in our selected industries. The LifeLogger video cloud storage solution and iOS and Android applications are architected
for scalability with high availability designed for use with widely available third party cloud based data providers.  

We
completed a prototype of our integrated Lifelogger wearable video camera for testing and continue to market this product to potential
distributors and joint venture and strategic alliance partners. We are evaluating opportunities from these marketing efforts to
determine the extent of our future development and marketing of this device.  

Software
Development Milestones    

Following
the successful launch of our private beta version of the LifeLogger Platform in August 2015 to users who expressed interest for
exclusive testing with their iOS and Android devices, we launched an open public version during the first quarter of 2016. This
release has the primary value proposition built in with geo-coordinates, face detection, playback with interactive map, social
engagement features that enable easy sharing and ability to  like  other postings. We are actively collecting and
monitoring the usage and feedback to launch a future iOS and Android release that is being designed to increase engagement with
added features for social engagement and continuous improvements to the user interface and experience.  

Revenue
Model    

We
plan to implement a freemium revenue model with viral marketing of free plans leading to paid upgrades and subscriptions for advanced
software features and additional storage. Our plan is to add a paid model following testing of the open beta platform, which we
expect to launch in late 2016 or early 2017.  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2015   

The
following comparative analysis on results of operations was based primarily on the comparative financial statements, footnotes
and related information for the periods identified below and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the
notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this report. The results discussed below are for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. For comparative purposes, we are comparing the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company s
consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this quarterly report.  

Revenue.
  Total revenue was $0 for the nine month ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. We plan to implement
a freemium revenue model with viral marketing of free plans leading to paid upgrades and subscriptions for advanced software features
and additional storage. Our plan is to add a paid model following testing of the open beta platform, which we expect to complete
in early 2017.  

Cost
of Revenue  . We had no cost of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015 as we had no revenues. We
are not able to predict what our expected gross profits will be in remaining periods in fiscal 2016 as we are unable to estimate
software licensing revenue from our LifeLogger Platform.  

Operating
Expenses  . Total operating expenses were $352,125 and $253,054 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September
30, 2015, respectively. Total operating expenses were $1,434,648 and $865,813 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
September 30, 2015, respectively. These increases are primarily attributable to increases in stock based compensation expense,
impairment of intangible assets related to certain assets acquired from Pixorial during June 2016 and general and administrative
expenses with an offsetting decrease in consulting and research and development. We expect increases in our operating expenses
as we ramp up our software development and sales efforts.  

Other
Expenses  . Other income (expenses) were $33,857 and ($1,208) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September
30, 2015, respectively. Other expenses were $1,482,299 and $1,208 for nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015,
respectively. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in loss on extinguishment of debt, change in fair value of
derivatives, commitment fee expense and interest expense associated with our increased borrowing and change in the fair value
of derivative warrants and notes. We expect increases in our interest expense due to our increased borrowings and are unable to
predict changes in the fair value of our derivative securities which is largely based on the trading price of our common stock.  

Net
Loss  . The net loss was $318,268 and $254,262 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.
The net loss was $2,926,997 and $867,021 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. This
increase is a result of the increase in operating expenses and other expenses discussed above.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Liquidity
is the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash requirements. As of September
30, 2016, our working capital amounted to $(1,168,194), a decrease of $761,432 as compared to working capital of $(406,762), as
of December 31, 2015. This decrease is primarily a result of increases in Convertible Notes Payable, derivative liabilities for
notes and warrants, accounts payable and amounts due a related party, partially offset by an increase in cash and decrease in
note payable. Working capital consisted primarily of cash of $209,817, Accounts payable and accrued expenses of $93,136 Convertible
Notes Payable of $981,212, and Derivative Liabilities of $303,156.  

Net
cash used in operating activities was $764,382 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to $625,565 in the
nine month period ended September 30, 2015. The increase in cash used in operating activities is primarily attributable to an
increase in net loss and partially offset by options issued as compensation, extinguishment of debt, impairment of intangible
assets and change in derivative liability reporting.  

Net
cash used in investing activities was $0 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to $332 in the nine month
period ended September 30, 2015.  

Net
cash provided by financing activities was $842,500 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to $530,000
in the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. The increase in cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds
from a note payable.  

We
do not have sufficient resources to effectuate all aspects of our business plan. We expect to incur a minimum of $570,000 in expenses
during the next twelve months of operations if we continue to pursue our current plans. We estimate that this will be comprised
of approximately $137,000 towards development of the Lifelogger Platform, $257,000 towards administrative and executive subcontractors,
and marketing expenses will be determined based on our open beta feedback. Additionally, approximately $176,000 will be needed
for general overhead expenses such as for corporate legal and accounting fees, office overhead and general working capital. We
will have to raise additional funds to pay for all of our planned expenses. We potentially will have to issue additional debt
or equity, or enter into a strategic arrangement with a third party to carry out some aspects of our business plan. There can
be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us. Other than the agreements discussed below, we currently have
no agreements, arrangements or understandings with any person to obtain funds through bank loans, lines of credit or any other
sources. Since we have no other such arrangements or plans currently in effect, our inability to raise funds for the above purposes
will have a severe negative impact on our ability to remain a viable company.  

Recent
Financing Transactions   

Securities
Purchase Agreement and Convertible Note Issued to Old Main Capital, LLC   

Promissory
Note and Warrants to SBI Investments LLC, 2014-1   

On
June 30, 2016 (the  Issuance Date ), we closed on the transactions contemplated by the securities purchase agreement
(the  SPA ) with SBI Investments LLC, 2014-1 ( SBI ), whereby SBI agreed to invest $500,000.00 (the  Purchase
Price ) in our Company in exchange for the Note (as defined below), Series A Warrant (as defined below), and Series B Warrant
(as defined below). Pursuant to the SPA, we issued a promissory note to SBI, in the original principal amount of $550,000.00,
which bears interest at 8% per annum (the  Note ). The Purchase Price was paid to us in full on the Issuance Date.
The maturity date of the Note is June 30, 2017 (the  Maturity Date ). Any amount of principal or interest that is
due under the Note, which is not paid by the Maturity Date, will bear interest at the rate of 24% per annum until it is paid.   

Beginning
6 months after the Issuance Date, we are required to make bi-weekly amortization payments (one payment every 2 weeks), consisting
of 1/12 th  of the outstanding principal and interest, until the Note is on longer outstanding (each a  Bi-Weekly
Payment ). Each Bi-Weekly Payment may be made in cash, or in our common stock ( Common Stock ) if certain equity
conditions are satisfied. Such equity conditions include but are not limited to an average daily dollar volume of the Common Stock
greater than $25,000.00 for the 20 trading days prior to a Bi-Weekly Payment. If the equity conditions are satisfied, and we decide
to make a Bi-Weekly payment in Common Stock, then the shares of Common Stock to be delivered shall be calculated as follows: the
amount of the Bi-Weekly Payment divided by the Base Conversion Price (as defined below). The Base Conversion Price shall equal
the lower of (i) the closing price of the Common Stock on June 30, 2016, or (ii) 60% of the average of the lowest VWAP of the
Common Stock for the 20 trading days immediately prior to the date of the Bi-Weekly Payment. Additionally, SBI has the right at
any time, beginning six months after the Issuance Date, to convert amounts owed under the Note into Common Stock at the closing
price of the Common Stock on June 30, 2016. The conversion price under the Note is subject to proportional adjustment in the event
of stock splits, stock dividends and similar corporate events as provided therein. If an event of default under the Note occurs,
SBI has the right to convert amounts owed under the Note into Common Stock at 60% multiplied by the lowest VWAP of the Common
Stock for the 20 trading days immediately prior to the applicable conversion date.  

The
Note is not convertible to the extent that (a) the number of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by the holder and (b)
the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Note or otherwise would result in the beneficial
ownership by holder of more than 4.99% of our then outstanding common stock. This ownership limitation can be increased or decreased
to any percentage not exceeding 9.99% by the holder upon 61 days  notice to us by the holder.  

The
Note can be prepaid by us at any time while the Note is outstanding, at a prepayment price of 125% multiplied by the outstanding
principal and interest of the Note, subject to SBI s discretionary acceptance. If an event of default occurs under the Note,
which is not cured within 10 business days after SBI s notice to us of such event of default, SBI has the option to require
our redemption of the Note in cash at a redemption price of 130% multiplied by the outstanding principal and interest of the Note.
The Note contains representations, warranties, events of default, beneficial ownership limitations, and other provisions that
are customary of similar instruments.  

In
conjunction with the issuance of the Note, we simultaneously issued to SBI a Series A warrant to purchase 125,000 shares of Common
Stock (the  Series A Warrant ) and Series B warrant to purchase 125,000 shares of Common Stock (the  Series
B Warrant ). The Warrants may be exercised by SBI at any time in the 3 year period following the Issuance Date. The exercise
price for each share of the Common Stock under the Series A Warrant is equal to $0.082. The exercise price for each share of the
Common Stock under the Series B Warrant is equal to $0.096. The exercise prices under the Series A Warrant and the Series B Warrant
are subject to proportional adjustment in the event of stock splits, stock dividends and similar corporate events as provided
therein. In addition, if at any time the Company grants, issues or sells any common stock equivalents or rights to purchase stock,
warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of any class of shares of Common Stock (the   Purchase
Rights  ), then the holder of the warrants will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights,
the aggregate Purchase Rights which the holder could have acquired if the holder had held the number of shares of common stock
acquirable upon complete exercise of the warrant (without regard to any limitations on exercise hereof, including without limitation,
the beneficial ownership limitation) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of
such purchase rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of common stock are to
be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such purchase rights (provided, however, to the extent that the holder s right
to participate in any such purchase right would result in the holder exceeding the beneficial ownership limitation, then the holder
shall not be entitled to participate in such purchase right to such extent (or beneficial ownership of such shares of common stock
as a result of such purchase right to such extent) and such purchase right to such extent shall be held in abeyance for the holder
until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the holder exceeding the beneficial ownership limitation).  

The
Note is not convertible to the extent that (a) the number of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by the holder and (b)
the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Note or otherwise would result in the beneficial
ownership by holder of more than 4.99% of our then outstanding common stock. This ownership limitation can be increased or decreased
to any percentage not exceeding 9.99% by the holder upon 61 days  notice to us by the holder.  

Equity
Line of Credit   

On
March 9, 2016, we issued an 8% convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $250,000 to Old Main as a commitment fee
for entering into a term sheet whereby Old Main agreed to provide us with up to $5,000,000 in financing over a 24 month period
through the purchase of our common stock. The proposed equity line will be subject to certain conditions, including, but not limited
to, our filing of a Registration Statement covering the resale of the securities issued to Old Main and our continued compliance
with the disclosure requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Old Main s commitment to provide
funding under the equity line of credit is subject to us entering into a definitive and binding agreement related to the proposed
equity line of credit and as of the date of this report we have not entered into any such agreement. We amended this convertible
note on June 9, 2016 to remove the equity condition limitations, removed the amortization payment requirements, to permit voluntary
conversions in common stock and revised the conversion price to mean the lesser of (a) the closing price of our common stock on
March 9, 2016 or (b) 60% of the lowest VWAP price of our common stock for the 15 consecutive trading days ending on the trading
day that is immediately prior to any applicable conversion date.  

Going
Concern Consideration   

We
have incurred significant losses since our inception on June 4, 2012. We had a net loss during the nine month period ended September
30, 2016 of $2,926,997 and an accumulated deficit of $4,255,784 as of September 30, 2016. This raises substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent our ability to raise additional
capital and generate additional revenues and profits from our business plan.  

In
the opinion of our independent registered public accounting firm for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, our auditor included
a statement that there is a substantial doubt as our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

Inflation   

In
the opinion of management, inflation has not and will not have a material effect on our operations in the immediate future. Management
will continue to monitor inflation and evaluate the possible future effects of inflation on our business and operations.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements    

Under
SEC regulations, we are required to disclose our off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current
or future effect on our financial condition, such as changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. As of September 30, 2016, we have no off-balance
sheet arrangements that meet such criterion.  

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Our
significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 of our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q.  

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.   

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required
under this Item 3.  

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange
Act ) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information
required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, and our Chief Financial Officer, CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. Management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our CEO and CFO, concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016 for the reasons discussed below.  

Management
identified the following material weakness and significant deficiencies in its assessment of the effectiveness of disclosure controls
and procedures as of September 30, 2016:  

Material
    Weakness   The Company did not maintain effective controls over certain aspects of the financial reporting process because
    we lacked a sufficient complement of personnel with a level of accounting expertise and an adequate supervisory review structure
    that is commensurate with our financial reporting requirements.   

Significant
    Deficiencies   Inadequate segregation of duties.   

We
expect to be materially dependent upon third parties to provide us with accounting consulting services related to derivative liability
treatment and for other accounting services for the foreseeable future. We believe this will be sufficient to remediate the material
weaknesses related to our accounting for derivative liability treatment discussed above. Until such time as we have a chief financial
officer with the requisite expertise in U.S. GAAP, there are no assurances that the material weaknesses and significant deficiencies
in our disclosure controls and procedures will not result in errors in our financial statements which could lead to a restatement
of those financial statements.  

Our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered
relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.  

Changes
in Internal Control   

There
were no changes identified in connection with our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September
30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION   

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered
or beneficial shareholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest.
