   NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)   
     
          NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
     
    Condensed Financial Statements   - The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of eRoomSystem Technologies, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the "Company"). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. These financial statements are condensed and, therefore, do not include all disclosures normally required by generally accepted accounting principles. These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. In particular, the Company's organization, nature of operations and significant accounting principles were presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in that annual report. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation have been included in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and consist of only normal recurring adjustments. The results of operations presented in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2016.  
     
    Cash and Cash Equivalents     Cash and cash equivalents include highly-liquid debt investments with original maturities of three months or less, readily convertible to known amounts of cash.  
     
    Investments in Debt and Equity Securities Available for Sale     Debt and equity securities available for sale include securities that can be sold at any time based upon needs or market conditions. Available for sale securities are accounted for at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses on these securities, net of income tax provisions, reflected in stockholders  equity as accumulated other comprehensive income.  
     
    Accounts Receivable   - Accounts receivable are stated at the historical carrying amount, net of write-offs and allowances. The Company has established an overall allowance based upon historical experience of 7% of the outstanding balance in addition to any specific customer collection issues identified by the Company. Uncollectible accounts receivable are written off when a settlement is reached or when the Company has determined that the balance will not be collected.  
     
    Inventory    -  The Company maintains an inventory of product that is sold in the refreshment centers in a number of hotels. The inventory is purchased as finished goods and is valued using the first in, first out method.  
     
    Advances to Hotels     The Company makes advances to hotels for their purchases of alcoholic beverages. The hotels  alcoholic beverages are placed in the Company s refreshment centers and the advances are settled at the date the hotel customers purchase the beverages from the refreshment centers.  
     
    Notes Receivable   - The notes receivable are stated at the historical carrying amount, less a loan loss allowance, and are evaluated for impairment. When projections indicate that the carrying value of the note is not recoverable, the carrying value will be reduced by the estimated excess of the carrying value over the projected discounted cash flows. The Company has evaluated the collectability of current notes receivable and believes the notes are realizable as they are secured by the related real property and the estimated fair value of the real property is in excess of the carrying value of the notes and the estimated cost to foreclose and sell the real property.  
     
    Investment in Real Property Tax Liens     The investments in the real property tax liens are accounted for as an investment in troubled debts and are carried at cost. Collection of interest, penalties and expense reimbursements is not certain and is recognized upon being realized. The Company has evaluated the collectability of the tax liens and believes the investments are realizable over time as the first position liens are secured by the related real property and the estimated fair value of the real property is in excess of the carrying value of the tax liens and the estimated cost to foreclose and sell the real property. Therefore no impairment was recognized on the tax liens at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
     
    Property and Equipment:   Property and equipment consist primarily of eRoomServ refreshment centers and are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Major additions and improvements are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred.

    Net Earnings (Loss) per Common Share   - Basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income, by the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive potential common share equivalents outstanding. When dilutive, the incremental potential common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options are determined by the treasury stock method.  
     
  The following table is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used in the calculation of basic and diluted loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:   

During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, there were 92,500 of potential common stock equivalents from options that were not included in the computation of diluted loss per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.  
     
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were 400,000 of potential common stock equivalents from options that were not included in the computation of diluted loss per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.  

NOTE 2   INVESTMENTS   
       
    Investment in Real Property Tax Liens     At September 30, 2016, the Company held $3,143 of real property tax liens, carried at lower of cost or estimated net realizable value, from various municipalities in New Jersey. The New Jersey municipal tax liens are receivable from the real property owners and are secured by a first priority lien on the related real property. Upon foreclosure, the Company would obtain ownership of the real property. The tax lien receivables accrue interest up to 18% per annum, accrue penalties at 2% to 6% and are also increased by the amount of any collection expenses incurred. The investment in the real property tax liens are accounted for as an investment in troubled debts and are carried at cost. Collection of interest, penalties and expense reimbursements is not certain and is recognized upon being realized.  
     
    Investment in Available for Sale Debt Securities    

The corporate debt securities mature on August 31, 2018 and May 29, 2020.  

NOTE 3   NOTES RECEIVABLE   
     
  To date, the Company loaned $1,642,000 in amounts ranging from $150,000 to $450,000 to various parties for a one year term with mortgage notes ranging in interest from 4.5% - 12%. Interest is due and payable monthly. The entire principal amounts are due and payable on the maturity date. The mortgages are collateralized by either commercial or residential property. Proceeds collected on these notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $646,202 and during the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $272,512. The carrying amounts of loans outstanding on September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $573,324 and $1,075,020 including interest accrued. The carrying amount of the notes receivable approximates their fair values based on their short-term maturity.

Accrued interest on notes receivable was $2,037 and $7,531 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 respectively, and was included in notes receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  

NOTE 4   STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY   
     
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company granted options to purchase 75,000 shares of common stock to employees for services rendered. These options, which vested immediately, have an exercise price of $0.06 per share and are exercisable through March 31, 2021. These options were valued at approximately $0.05 per share, or $3,650, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: market value of the common stock of $0.06 per share, risk free interest rate of 1.21%, dividend yield of 0.0%, volatility of 116% and expected life of 5 years. The pricing model utilized the full life of the options as the Company generally has a low turnover rate of its employees.  
     
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company granted options to purchase 50,000 shares of common stock to a consultant for services rendered. These options, which vested immediately, have an exercise price of $0.06 per share and are exercisable through April 1, 2021. These options were valued at approximately $0.05 per share, or $2,434, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: market value of the common stock of $0.06 per share, risk free interest rate of 1.21%, dividend yield of 0.0%, volatility of 116% and expected life of 5 years.   
     
  Stock-based compensation expense relating to stock options of $6,084 and $8,054 was recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. There was no unrecognized compensation related to stock options at September 30, 2016. A summary of stock option and warrant activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is as follows:  

All of the options and warrants were exercisable at September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016 the intrinsic value for the options and warrants outstanding was $750.  

NOTE 5   FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   
     
  Generally accepted accounting principles define fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. To measure fair value, a hierarchy has been established which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. This hierarchy uses three levels of inputs to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities as follows:  
     
  Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  
  Level 2   Observable inputs other than Level 1 including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active markets, or other observable inputs that can be corroborated by observable market data.  
  Level 3   Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity for financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.  
     
  The Company uses fair value to measure certain assets and liabilities on a recurring basis when fair value is the primary measure for accounting. Fair value is also used on a nonrecurring basis to measure certain assets when applying lower of cost or market accounting or when adjusting carrying values. Fair value is also used when evaluating impairment on certain assets, including notes receivable and long-lived assets. The following table sets forth the estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a reoccurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

   Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

Fair Value of Financial Instruments Not Required To Be Reported at Fair Value   
     
  The fair values of real property tax liens and notes receivable are based on a combination of the stated or implied interest rates at the measurement dates, approximate their carrying amounts and are considered to fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  

NOTE 6   CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AND SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS   
     
  The Company's historical revenues and receivables have been derived primarily from the lodging industry. The Company offers credit terms in connection with its sale of products from refreshment centers. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and does not require collateral from its customers. The Company maintains an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable based upon a percentage of accounts receivable at year end.  
     
  At September 30, 2016, the Company had accounts receivable from one customers which accounted for 38% of total accounts receivable and from a second customer which accounted for 21% of total accounts receivable.  
     
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, revenues from one customer accounted for 37% of total revenues and 26% from a second customer.   
     
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, revenues from one customer accounted for 34% of total revenues and 28% from a second customer.

   Overview   
     
  The Company introduced to the lodging industry an amenity management platform, or the AMENITIES MANAGER . The platform s core is proprietary software that provides a cloud-based system to assist a hotel in enhancing its image and theme through distinctive products and managing its amenities with optimized efficiency.

In addition to providing our customers with valuable amenity management solutions that pay for itself, our revenue-sharing program has allowed us to partner with our customers and provide our solutions at little or no up-front cost. Our customers share in revenues generated from the sale of goods and services related to our platform. As an alternative solution, we offer a turnkey arrangement which provides both products and restockers to hotels.

    Results of Operations    
       
   Revenue Recognition   
     
  We generate revenues from the sale of products in hotel in-room refreshment centers, from maintenance services and the lease of equipment. Revenue from the sale of refreshments from the refreshment centers is recognized upon removal of the item from the refreshment center by the hotel guest. Maintenance revenue is recognized as the services are performed. Lease revenue is recognized over the term of the lease.     
     
   Description of Expenses   
       
  Cost of revenue consists primarily of cost of goods sold, as well as customer support and maintenance.

Although the preceding table summarizes the net changes and percent changes with respect to our revenues and our cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the trends contained therein are limited and should not be viewed as a definitive indication of our future results.

   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
     
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09 ), which stipulates that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.  ASU 2014-09 will be effective for the Company retrospectively beginning January 1, 2017, with early adoption not permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
     
   Contractual Cash Obligations and Commercial Commitments   
     
  There were no significant contractual cash obligations or commercial commitments either on or off balance sheet as of September 30, 2016.  
       
   Off Balance Sheet Arrangements   
     
  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Item      3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   
     
  A smaller reporting company, as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, is not required to provide the information required by this item.  
     
    Item      4.  Controls and Procedures   
     
   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
     
  Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have reviewed the effectiveness of our "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and have concluded that because of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting due to lack of segregation of duties, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that the Company s disclosure and controls are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Notwithstanding the material weakness discussed below, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements (unaudited) included in this Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  
     
    Lack of Segregation of Duties    
     
  Management is aware that there is a lack of segregation of duties at the Company due to the small number of employees dealing with general administrative and financial matters. However, at this time management has decided that considering the abilities of the employees now involved and the control procedures in place, the risks associated with such lack of segregation are low and the potential benefits of adding employees to clearly segregate duties do not justify the substantial expenses associated with such increases. Management will periodically reevaluate this situation.  
     
   Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting   
     
  There have been no changes  in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonable likely to materially  affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
