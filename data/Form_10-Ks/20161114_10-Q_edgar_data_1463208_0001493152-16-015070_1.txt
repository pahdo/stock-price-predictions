1.
ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS   

PetroTerra
Corp. (the  Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada, on July 25, 2008. The Company is an
independent exploration and development company focused on the acquisition of property (or property leases enabling us to explore
and exploit such property) that we believe may contain extractable oil and/or gas. The Company identified, evaluated and acquired
oil and gas exploration and development opportunities primarily within the United States. As a result of the decline in the oil
and gas markets, we are now seeking strategic alternatives. The Company has not generated any revenue to date and consequently
its operations are subject to all risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise.  

2.
GOING CONCERN   

The
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets
and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has incurred losses since
inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of $2,763,194 as of September 30, 2016 and further losses are anticipated in the
development of its business raising substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability
to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the
necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities, which have arisen from normal business operations as they
come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand loans from our
director and/or private placements of common stock.  

3.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Basis
of Presentation   

The
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America and are presented in US dollars.  

These
statements reflect all adjustments, including of normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary
for fair presentation of the information contained therein. It is suggested that these unaudited interim financial statements
be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2016 and notes thereto included
in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K. The Company follows the same accounting policies in the preparation of its
annual and interim reports.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

The
Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity date of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash
equivalents.  

Use
of Estimates and Assumptions   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In management s opinion, all adjustments necessary for a fair
statement of the results for the interim periods have been made and all adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)   

Foreign
Currency Translation   

The
Company s functional currency and its reporting currency is the United States dollar.  

Stock
Split   

On
July 1, 2015, the Company filed a Certificate of Change with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to effect a reverse
stock split of its outstanding and authorized shares of common stock at a ratio of 1 for 2.5 (the  Reverse Stock Split ).  

As
a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the Company s authorized shares of common stock were decreased from 100,000,000 to
40,000,000 shares and its authorized shares of preferred stock were decreased from 10,000,000 to 4,000,000 shares. Upon the effectiveness
of the Reverse Stock Split, which occurred on July 1, 2015, the Company s issued and outstanding shares of common stock
was decreased from approximately 66,125,000 to 26,450,000 shares, all with a par value of $0.001. The Company has no outstanding
shares of preferred stock. Accordingly, all share and per share information has been restated to retroactively show the effect
of the Reverse Stock Split.  

Stock-based
Compensation   

In
September 2009, the FASB issued ASC-718,  Stock Compensation . ASC-718 requires all share-based payments to employees,
including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on the grant date fair value of
the award. Under ASC-718, the Company must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share-based payments,
the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption.  

Income
Taxes   

Income
taxes are accounted for under the assets and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases and operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  

Basic
and Diluted Loss Per Share   

The
Company computes loss per share in accordance with ASC-260,  Earnings per Share  which requires presentation of both
basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing
net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period.
Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Dilutive loss
per share excludes all potential shares of common stock if their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company has no potential dilutive
instruments and accordingly basic loss and diluted loss per share are equal.  

Fiscal
Periods   

The
Company s fiscal year end is March 31.

Revenue
Recognition   

The
Company will recognize revenue in accordance with ACS - 605,  Revenue recognition , ASC-605 requires that four basic
criteria be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred;
(3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and
(4) are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the
collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other
adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The Company will defer any revenue for which the
product has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that
the product has been delivered or no refund will be required.  

Oil
and Gas   

The
Company complies with ASC 932,  Extractive Activities - Oil and Gas . The Company has capitalized exploratory well
costs, and has determined that there are no suspended well costs that should be impaired. The Company reviews its long-lived assets
for impairments when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred.  

Website   

The
Company capitalizes the costs associated with the development of the Company s website pursuant to ASC - 350,  Goodwill
and Other . Other costs related to the maintenance of the website are expensed as incurred. Amortization is provided over
the estimated useful lives of three years using the straight-line method for financial statement purposes. The Company commenced
amortization upon completion of the Company s fully operational website. Amortization expense for the six months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 totaled $7,433 and $4,676, respectively.  

Property
and Equipment   

Property
and equipment are carried at cost. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments that extend the useful lives of property and
equipment are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization
of property and equipment is provided using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes at rates based on the following
estimated useful lives:

Advertising   

The
Company follows the policy of charging the costs of advertising to expenses incurred. The Company incurred $0 in advertising costs
during the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

In
February 2016, FASB issued ASU-2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842).  The guidance requires that a lessee recognize in the statement
of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right of use asset representing its right
to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For finance leases: the right-of-use asset and a lease liability will be initially
measured at the present value of the lease payments, in the statement of financial position; interest on the lease liability will
be recognized separately from amortization of the right-of-use asset in the statement of comprehensive income; and repayments
of the principal portion of the lease liability will be classified within financing activities and payments of interest on the
lease liability and variable lease payments within operating activities in the statement of cash flows. For operating leases:
the right-of-use asset and a lease liability will be initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in the statement
of financial position; a single lease cost will be recognized, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the
lease term on a generally straight-line basis; and all cash payments will be classified within operating activities in the statement
of cash flows. Under Topic 842 the accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged from that applied under previous GAAP.
The amendments in Topic 842 are effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019, including interim periods within that fiscal
year. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard.  

In
January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ), issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
2016-01,  Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities,  which amends the guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles on the classification and measurement
of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities
under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, the ASU
clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized
losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after
December 15, 2017, and are to be adopted by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the
first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record
fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other
comprehensive income. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard.  

In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, 
which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified
as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This ASU is effective for financial statements issued for annual
periods beginning after December 16, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The adoption of this standard will
not have any impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations and disclosures.

ACQUISITION OF OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES   

On
November 18, 2013, the Company entered into an assignment of lease (the  Agreement ) whereby Ardmore Investments Inc.
( Ardmore ) assigned to the Company its rights under a certain purchase agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ),
dated August 8, 2013, between Ardmore and Pioneer Oil and Gas ( Pioneer ) involving the sale of 5,905.54 acres of
oil and gas leases located in the Central Utah Thrust Belt in Beaver County and Sevier County, Utah and currently owned by Pioneer
(the  Leases ). Per the terms of the Agreement, we issued to Ardmore an aggregate of 200,000 shares (100,000 share
installments) of our common stock on November 18, 2013 and April 12, 2014 in order to complete the assignment. Furthermore, on
December 12, 2013, February 12, 2014 and April 12, 2014, the Company made three installment payments of $100,000 each to Pioneer.
Upon completion of the final installment the leases were conveyed to the Company.  

Due
to the lack of an active market of the Company s common stock, the fair value of the common stock issued to Ardmore was
determined based on the price at which the Company s shares were most recently being sold in a private placement transaction.  

Impairment   

The
Company determined that there was a material impairment of the land lease agreements and recorded an impairment of the asset of
$737,500 in the year ended March 31, 2016.  

5.
COMMON STOCK   

The
Company s authorized capital consists of 40,000,000 shares of common stock and 4,000,000 shares of preferred stock, both
with a par value of $0.001 per share.  

On
July 1, 2015, the Company effectuated a reverse stock split of its outstanding and authorized shares of common stock at a ratio
of 1 for 2.5. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the Company s authorized shares of common stock were decreased from
100,000,000 to 40,000,000 shares and its authorized shares of preferred stock were decreased from 10,000,000 to 4,000,000 shares.
Upon the effectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split, which occurred on July 1, 2015, the Company s issued and outstanding
shares of common stock was decreased from 66,124,593 to 26,449,868 shares, all with a par value of $0.001. The Company has no
outstanding shares of preferred stock. Accordingly, all share and per share information has been restated in this Report to retroactively
show the effect of the Reverse Stock Split.  

On
April 27, 2016, the Company authorized the issuance of 50,000 shares of common stock to the Company s Chief Operating Officer
for consulting services. The fair value of the shares of common stock was $4,000.  

On
June 3, 2016, the Company issued 1,022,122 shares in exchange for the conversion of $10,118 of shareholder loans and $71,250
of accrued officer payroll and recorded a loss on conversion of debt expense of $10,622 during the period ending September 30,
2016 (See Note 5).  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had 28,323,588 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.

INCOME TAXES   

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $2,763,194 that may be available to
reduce future years  taxable income through 2034. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not
been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur. Accordingly, the Company
has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards.  

7.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   

Chief
Executive Officer   

The
Company has received advances from certain of its officers and other related parties to meet short term working capital
needs. These advances may not have formal repayment terms or arrangements. The loan is non-interest bearing, due upon demand
and unsecured. On June 3, 2016, Mr. Barton converted the loan balance of $10,118 into 127,106 shares of common stock.
As of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the total amount loaned to the Company by a director was $14,187 and $10,118,
respectively.  

On
February 4, 2014, the Company entered into a three year employment agreement with the Company s Chief Executive Officer
whereby the Company provides for compensation of $10,000 per month. A total salary of $60,000 was expensed during the six months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The total balance due to the Chief Executive Officer for accrued salaries at September 30,
2016 and March 31, 2016, was $27,000 and $41,250, respectively. Additionally, on each anniversary of the Employment Agreement,

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION     

GENERAL   

We
are a development stage company that identified, evaluated and acquired oil and gas exploration and development opportunities
primarily in the United States. As a result of the decline in the oil and gas markets, we are now seeking other strategic alternatives.  

We
were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 25, 2008 as  Loran Connection Corp.  We were formed
to provide a variety of services in the area of individual and group tourism and business support in Ukraine. We subsequently
filed a resale registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 28, 2009, which was declared effective
on October 28, 2009. On January 25, 2012, we filed an amendment to our articles of incorporation to, among other things, change
our name to  PetroTerra Corp.  and effect a thirty-two-for-one reverse split. We changed our name to reflect a proposed
change in our business operations. On October 2, 2013, in connection with a change of control in the management of the Company,
the Company began its current business operations in the oil and gas sector. On December 18, 2013, we filed a certificate of change
to effect a one-for-two reverse stock split of our authorized and our outstanding shares of common stock and preferred stock.
On April 12, 2014, we completed our acquisition of certain property leases (the  Leases ) held by Ardmore Investments
Inc. ( Ardmore ) for property owned by Pioneer Oil and Gas ( Pioneer ) covering 5,905.54 acres of land
located in the Central Utah Thrust Belt in Beaver County and Sevier County, Utah (the  Utah Properties ). Since January
2016, as a result of the decline in the oil and gas markets, we ceased investing in the Utah Properties and began seeking a strategic
alternative both inside and outside of the oil and gas market.  

Our
principal executive offices are located at 422 East Vermijo Avenue, Suite 313, Colorado Springs, CO 80903. The telephone number
at our principal executive offices is (719) 219-6404. Our web site is www.petroterracorp.com.  

Our
Business Plan   

The
Company was an independent exploration and development company focused on the acquisition of property (or property leases enabling
us to explore and exploit such property) that we believed may contain extractable oil and/or gas.  

On
November 18, 2013, we entered into an assignment of lease agreement whereby Ardmore assigned to us its rights under a certain
Purchase Agreement, dated August 8, 2013, between Ardmore and Pioneer involving the sale of 5,905.54 acres of three separate BLM
Management oil and gas Leases located in the Central Utah Thrust Belt in Beaver County and Sevier County, Utah and currently owned
by Pioneer. Per the terms of the Agreement, we issued to Ardmore 100,000 shares of our common stock on November 18, 2013, and,
in order to complete the assignment contemplated by the Agreement, we issued to Ardmore an additional 100,000 shares of our common
stock upon the transfer to us of ownership in the Leases, which occurred on April 12, 2014. Furthermore, the Company made three
installment payments of $100,000 each to Pioneer pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement. The Leases were conveyed to
the Company on April 10, 2014.  

In
January 2014 we hired a third party independent contractor to provide insight and to assist in the development of a plan regarding
the exploration of any properties that we acquire. In March 2014, we engaged a third party independent contractor to provide geologic
consulting services to the Company. In March 2014 we also obtained an MHA Technical Report on the Utah Properties. In September
2014, we engaged a third party independent contractor to review and process both the public domain gravity and aeromagnetic datasets
that existed on our leased Utah Properties. In November 2014, we engaged a third party independent contractor to perform a comprehensive
gravity survey on our Utah Properties which was completed in December 2014 and the results of such survey were interpreted in
February 2015.  

On
September 28, 2014, the Company engaged Thompson Solutions, LLC ( Thompson ) to review and process both the public
domain gravity and aeromagnetic datasets that existed on our leased Utah Properties. The purpose of this review was to identify
major structures and geologic trends of interest on the Utah Properties. Based on the results of this analysis, on November 21,
2014, the Company engaged Magee Geophysical Services LLC ( Magee ) to perform a comprehensive gravity survey on our
Utah Properties. The gravity survey was conducted from November 22, 2014 through December 9, 2014 and cost the Company approximately
$55,000. Pursuant to the survey, a total of 737 new gravity stations were identified on a nominal quarter mile grid and the data
acquired was merged with re-processed public domain data including about 630 stations located in and around the main grid. Upon
completion of Magee s gravity survey, on December 8, 2014, the Company engaged Thompson to further process the data obtained
by Magee and to provide custom processing and mapping of such data. On February 6, 2015, Thompson completed their interpretation
of the gravity survey. The Company will pay to Thompson $15,500 for its services.  

On
February 2, 2015 the Company engaged PRISEM Geoscience Consulting LLC ( PRISEM ) to provide recommendations on a work
plan for creating a geologic model of the Utah Properties. Due to the volatility of the oil and gas market, the geologic model
was never completed.  

Our
Properties   

As
described above, the Company holds oil and gas leases for property in Sevier and Beaver Counties, Utah. On April 10th 2014, we
acquired the Leases pursuant to the Agreement. These three Leases cover 5,950.54 gross acres in Sevier and Beaver counties in
southwest Utah. The two Sevier leases, UTU-89243 and UTU-89244, each have a term through 02/01/2023 (hereinafter, the  Sevier
Prospect ). Our Beaver county lease, UTU-86466, has an expiration date of 02/01/2021 (hereinafter, the  Beaver Prospect 
and together with the Sevier Prospect, the  Sevier and Beaver Oil Project ). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement which
governs the terms under which we can use the Utah Properties, we have a 100% Working Interest (WI) and an 80% Net Revenue Interest
(NRI) in the Leases.  

Oil
and Gas Industry-Specific Disclosures   

As
described above, the Company had only recently begun its oil and gas business operations before operations were halted in order
to identify other strategic alternatives, not necessarily limited to the oil and gas industry. Accordingly, the disclosure required
by Subpart 1200 of Regulation S-K (Section 229.1200 of this chapter) is not applicable to our Company as of the date hereof. The
Company has obtained Leases in the Central Utah Thrust Belt in Beaver County and Sevier County, Utah consisting of 5,950.54 gross
acres of undeveloped acreage.  

Current
Business Plan   

Given
the current climate in the oil and gas industry, on or about January 2016, management determined to cease development of our oil
and gas leases and instead seek a strategic alternative, whether in the oil and gas industry or otherwise.  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS    

Our
financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments
relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be
unable to continue our operation.  

We
expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital
through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.  

Three
Month Period Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Month Period Ended September 30, 2015.    

Our
net loss for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 was $55,875 compared to a net loss of $143,145 during the three-month
period ended September 30, 2015. We did not generate any revenue during the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

This
change in net loss was primarily the result of the following:  

Lease
property and exploration costs   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred lease property and exploration costs of $0 compared to the prior year period
amount of $33,269 as the Company ceased paying consulting costs in the current year,  

General
and administrative costs   

During
the three month period ended September 30, 2016, we incurred general and administrative expenses of $35,078 compared to $42,905
incurred during the three-month period ended September 30, 2015. The general and administrative expense incurred during the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was primarily related to compensation to our Chief Executive Officer of $30,000, with
a nominal difference between corporate overhead and travel costs between periods.  

Professional
Fees   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred professional fees of $20,797 relating to our equity financings, operations
and public company compliance. The legal and accounting fees associated with these activities amounted to $5,636 and $9,000, respectively,
and the corporate and investor relations fees associated with these activities amounted to $6,161. During the three months ended
September 30, 2015, we incurred professional fees of $49,371 relating to the legal and accounting fees of $15,000 and $9,000,
respectively, and the corporate and investor relations fees associated with these activities amounted to $25,371.  

Non-Employee
Stock Based Compensation   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred expense of $0 and $17,600 for stock issuances for compensation
to our Chief Operating Officer and for professional and advisory services, respectively.  

Weighted
average number of shares   

The
weighted average number of shares outstanding was 28,323,588 and 26,589,887 for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. The weighted average number of shares is an average calculation incorporating changes to the shares outstanding
within the period reported and has been restated to retroactively show the effect of the Reverse Stock Split on July 1, 2015.  

Six
Month Period Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Six Month Period Ended September 30, 2015.    

Our
net loss for the six month period ended September 30, 2016 was $132,677 compared to a net loss of $236,947 during the six month
period ended September 30, 2015 for the reasons described below. During the six month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
we did not generate any revenue.  

Lease
property and exploration costs   

During
the six months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred lease property and exploration costs of $0 compared to the prior year period
amount of $46,686 as the Company ceased paying consulting costs in the current year.  

General
and administrative costs   

During
the six month period ended September 30, 2016, we incurred general and administrative expenses of $69,842 compared to $80,838
incurred during the six month period ended September 30, 2015. The general and administrative expense incurred during the six
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were primarily related to compensation to our Chief Executive Officer of $60,000, corporate
overhead and travel costs.  

Professional
Fees   

During
the six months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred professional fees of $48,213 relating to our equity financings, operations
and public company compliance. The legal and accounting fees associated with these activities amounted to $18,355 and $19,796,
respectively, and the corporate and investor relations fees associated with these activities amounted to $10,062. During the six
months ended September 30, 2015, we incurred professional fees of $91,823 relating to our equity financings, operations and public
company compliance. The legal and accounting fees associated with these activities amounted to $35,374 and $18,046, respectively,
and the corporate and investor relations fees associated with these activities amounted to $38,403.  

Non-Employee
Stock Based Compensation   

During
the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred expense of $4,000 and $17,600 for stock issuances for compensation
to our Chief Operating Officer and for professional and advisory services, respectively.  

The
weighted average number of shares outstanding was 27,958,474 and 26,609,200 for the six month periods ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively.  

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

We
had no cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016.  

We
have experienced losses of $132,677 and $236,947 for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and had an
accumulated deficit of $2,763,194 at September 30, 2016. In addition, we have not completed our efforts to establish a stable
recurring source of revenues sufficient to cover our operating costs and expect to continue to generate losses for the foreseeable
future. There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain an adequate level of financing needed for our near term requirements
or the long-term development and exploration of our Leases or any other strategic alternative that we may pursuit. These conditions
raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a  going concern .  

Since
inception, we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our common stock, receiving aggregate net proceeds
totaling $1,359,500 from the period beginning October 1, 2013 through September 30, 2016.  

Six
months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared with six months Ended September 30, 2015   

Cash
Flows from Operating Activities   

We
have generated negative cash flows from operating activities. For the six months ended September 30, 2016, net cash flows used
in operating activities was $14,187 consisting of a net loss of $132,677, adjusted by non-cash stock compensation of $4,000, non-cash
conversion of debt of $40,622, depreciation and amortization of $7,895, an increase of $37,218 in accounts payables and accrued
liabilities, an increase in accrued officer payroll of $27,000, and a decrease in prepaid expenses of $1,875. Furthermore, as
of September 30, 2016 we had net cash overdraft repayments of $120.  

For
the six months ended September 30, 2015, net cash flows used in operating activities was $241,918 consisting of a net loss of
$236,947, adjusted by non-cash stock compensation of $17,600, depreciation and amortization of $4,907, a decrease of $20,793 in
accounts payables and accrued liabilities, a decrease of $2,500 for accrued officer compensation, and an increase in prepaid expenses
of $3,750. Furthermore, as of March 31, 2015 we had a cash overdraft repayment of $435.  

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities   

We
have financed our operations primarily from either cash advances or the issuance of equity instruments. We generated cash from
financing activities of $14,187 from shareholder loans and $262,000 from the issuance of common stock in the six months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

PLAN
OF OPERATION AND FUNDING  

We
expect that our working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further
issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business.  

Our
existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are not adequate to fund our operations
over the next twelve months and the Company is dependent upon additional equity raises. We have no lines of credit or other bank
financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of our private placement of equity.
In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures
relating to our pursuit of a strategic alternative from the development of our oil and gas leases. We believe that we will need
$250,000 in additional capital to operate for the next twelve months. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities
will result in dilution to our current stockholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior
to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available
or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities
that could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. We will have to raise additional funds in the next twelve
months in order to sustain and expand our operations. We currently do not have a specific plan of how we will obtain such funding;
however, we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. We have
and will continue to seek to obtain short-term loans from our director, although no future arrangement for additional loans has
been made. We do not have any agreements with our director concerning these loans. We do not have any arrangements in place for
any future equity financing.  

OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  

As
of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to
have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.  

GOING
CONCERN  

The
independent auditors  report accompanying our March 31, 2016 financial statements contained an explanatory paragraph expressing
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating
to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result
from this uncertainty.

Our
management, consisting of our sole officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Rule 13a-15(e)) as of September 30, 2016. Management

of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
controls and procedures. Our management has assessed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and based upon
that evaluation, our sole officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30,
2016.

      I
    am the only certifying officer responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined

I,

      I
    have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q PETROTERRA CORP.;   

2.  
      Based
    on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
    to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect
    to the period covered by quarterly report;   

3.  
      Based
    on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this Report, fairly present in all
    material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
    presented in this report;   

4.  
      I
    am the only certifying officer responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
    in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d- 15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act
    Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:   

a)  
      designed
    such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure control and procedures to be designed under our supervision,
    to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
    us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;   

b)  
      designed
    such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
    our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
    statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;   

c)  
      evaluated
    the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions
    about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based
    on such evaluation; d) disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting
    that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the
    case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s
    internal control over financial reporting; and   

5.  
      I
    have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s
    auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):   

a)  
      all
    significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
    are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process summarize and report financial
    information; and b) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
    role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
