1.  Organization and nature of operations   

ChinaNet Online Holdings, Inc. (the  Company )
was incorporated in the State of Texas in April 2006 and re-domiciled to become a Nevada corporation in October 2006. On June 26,
2009, the Company consummated a share exchange transaction with China Net Online Media Group Limited (the  Share Exchange ),
a company organized under the laws of British Virgin Islands ( China Net BVI ). As a result of the Share Exchange,
China Net BVI became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and the Company is now a holding company, which, through certain
contractual arrangements with operating companies in the People s Republic of China (the  PRC ), is engaged in
providing advertising, precision marketing, online to offline (O2O) sales channel expansion and the related data services to small
and medium enterprises ( SMEs ) and entrepreneurial management and networking services for entrepreneurs in the PRC. 

The Company s wholly owned subsidiary, China Net
BVI was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. China Net BVI is the parent holding company of CNET Online Technology Limited,
a Hong Kong company ( China Net HK ), which established and is the parent company of Rise King Century Technology Development
(Beijing) Co., Ltd., a wholly foreign-owned enterprise ( WFOE ) established in the PRC ( Rise King WFOE ). 

To satisfy PRC laws and regulations, the Company conducts
certain business in the PRC through its Variable Interest Entities ( VIEs ). Through a series of contractual agreements
between Rise King WFOE and Business Opportunity Online (Beijing) Network Technology Co., Ltd. ( Business Opportunity Online )
and Beijing CNET Online Advertising Co., Ltd. ( Beijing CNET Online ) (collectively the  PRC Operating Entities 
or the  VIEs ), the Company, through the WFOE, secures significant rights to influence the PRC Operating Entities 
business operations, policies and management, approve all matters requiring shareholder approval, and the right to receive 100%
of the income earned by the VIEs. Pursuant to the contractual agreements, all of the equity owners' rights and obligations of the
VIEs were assigned to Rise King WFOE, which resulted in the equity owners lacking the ability to make decisions that have a significant
effect on the VIEs, Rise King WFOE's ability to extract the profits from the operation of the VIEs and assume the residual benefits
of the VIEs. Due to the fact that Rise King WFOE and its indirect parent are the sole interest holders of the VIEs, the Company
included the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the VIEs in its consolidated financial statements, which is consistent
with the provisions of FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 810  Consolidation , subtopic
10. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company operated its business
primarily in China through its PRC subsidiaries and PRC operating entities, or VIEs as discussed in the Company s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
 2015 Form 10-K ). 

On August 18, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of
Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Nevada to effect a one-for-two and one-half (1 for 2.5)
reverse stock split of the Company s common stock (the  Common Stock ), which became effective on August 19,
2016 (the  Reverse Stock Split ). When the Reverse Stock Split became effective, each two and one-half shares of issued
and outstanding Common Stock were converted into one newly issued and outstanding share of Common Stock. No fractional shares were
issued in connection with the reverse stock split. Any fractional shares of Common Stock that would have otherwise resulted from
the reverse stock split were rounded up to the nearest full share. The Reverse Stock Split did not change the par value of the
Common Stock and had no effect on the number of authorized shares of Common Stock of the Company. As a result of the Reverse Stock
Split, 30,395,722 shares of Common Stock that were issued and outstanding at August 19, 2016 was reduced to 12,158,542 shares of
Common Stock (taking into account the rounding of fractional shares). All number of shares and per share data have been retroactively
restated to reflect the 1 for 2.5 reverse stock split of the Company wherever applicable for all the periods presented.

additional claims on the Company s general assets.

CHINANET ONLINE HOLDINGS, INC.        NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)     

3.  Summary of significant accounting policies   

a)  Basis of presentation   

The condensed consolidated interim
financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America ( U.S. GAAP ). 

The condensed consolidated interim
financial information as of September 30, 2016 and for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared
without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Certain
information and footnote disclosures, which are normally included in annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP, have been omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations. The condensed consolidated interim financial information
should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto, included in the 2015 Form 10-K. 

In the opinion of management, all
adjustments (which include normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present a fair statement of the Company s consolidated
financial position as of September 30, 2016, its consolidated results of operations for the nine and three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, and its consolidated cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, as applicable, have been
made. The interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any
future periods. 

b)  Principles of consolidation   

The condensed consolidated interim
financial statements include the financial statements of all the subsidiaries and VIEs of the Company. All transactions and balances
between the Company and its subsidiaries and VIEs have been eliminated upon consolidation. 

c)  Comparability due to discontinued operation   

In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015,
the Company exited its brand management and sales channel building business segment, which qualified for presentation as a discontinued
operation in accordance with ASC Topic 205. As a result, the results of operations of this business was reported in discontinued
operation as a separate component in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss
for all periods presented. Certain accounts in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the
nine and three months ended September 30, 2015 and related notes have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the effect of reclassification
of results of operations reported in discontinued operation as a separate component. 

d)  Use of estimates   

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of these condensed consolidated financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company continually evaluates these
estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information, historical experience and various other assumptions
that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the
financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates.

e)  Foreign currency translation   

The exchange rates used to translate
amounts in RMB into US$ for the purposes of preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements are as follows: 

No representation
is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be converted into US$ at the above rates.  

f)  Advertising costs   

Advertising costs for the Company s
own brand building are not includable in cost of revenues, they are expensed when incurred or amortized over the estimated beneficial
period and are included in  sales and marketing expenses  in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss. For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, advertising expenses for the Company s own brand building were approximately
US$1,684,000 and US$1,740,000, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, advertising expenses for the
Company s own brand building were approximately US$724,000 and US$520,000, respectively. 

g)  Research and development expenses   

The Company accounts for the cost
of developing and upgrading technologies and platforms and intellectual property that are used in its daily operations in research
and development cost. Research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred. Expenses for research and development
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately US$1,530,000 and US$1,658,000, respectively. Expenses
for research and development for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately US$514,000 and US$595,000,
respectively. 

h)  Recent accounting standards   

In February 2016, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . The amendments in this ASU requires that a lessee recognize the assets and
liabilities that arise from operating leases. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to
make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the
lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an  accounting
policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. In transition, lessees and lessors
are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective
approach. For public business entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application of the amendments in this ASU is permitted for all
entities. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial position and results of operations upon
adopting these amendments . 

CHINANET ONLINE HOLDINGS, INC.        NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)     

In  April 2016, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing .
The amendments in this ASU do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the amendments in this ASU clarify
the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining
the related principles for those areas. The amendments in this ASU affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers (Topic 606), which is not yet effective. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this
ASU are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in Topic 606 (and any other Topic amended by Update 2014-09).
ASU 2015-14 defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated
financial position and results of operations upon adopting these amendments. 

 In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients .
The amendments in this ASU do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the amendments in this ASU affect
only the narrow aspects of Topic 606, which include (1) Assessing the Collectibility Criterion and Accounting for Contracts That
Do Not Meet the Criteria for Step 1; (2) Presentation of Sales Taxes and Other Similar Taxes Collected from Customers; (3) Noncash
Consideration; (4) Contract Modifications at Transition Completed Contracts at Transition; (5); and (6) Technical Correction.
The amendments in this ASU affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which is not
yet effective. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this ASU are the same as the effective date
and transition requirements in Topic 606 (and any other Topic amended by Update 2014-09). ASU 2015-14 defers the effective date
of ASU 2014-09 by one year. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial position and results
of operations upon adopting these amendments. 

 Other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other
standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s
consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 

CHINANET ONLINE HOLDINGS, INC.        NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)     

4.  Term deposit   

Term deposit as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015 represented the amount of cash placed as a term deposit by one of the Company s operating VIEs in a major financial
institution in China, which management believes is of high credit quality. The term deposit matured on July 7, 2016 and was extended
to July 7, 2017. The interest rate of the term deposit is 2.25% per annum. 

5.  Accounts receivable, net   

All of the accounts receivable are non-interest bearing. Based on the assessment of the collectability of
the accounts receivable as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company provided approximately US$2,855,000 and US$3,070,000
allowance for doubtful accounts, which were primarily related to the accounts receivable of the Company s internet advertising
and TV advertising business segment with an aging over six months. The Company determines the allowance based on aging data, historical
collection experience, customer specific facts and economic conditions. For the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016,
no allowance for doubtful accounts was provided or reversed. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company reversed
approximately US$56,000 allowance for doubtful accounts. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company provided approximately
US$21,000 allowance for doubtful accounts. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, accounts receivable and the related allowance
decreased by approximately US$0.22 million and US$0.13 million, respectively, due to disposal of a VIE during the period.  

6.  Other receivables, net   

TV advertisement deposit
and prepayment receivable as of December 31, 2015 represented the uncollected portion of the deposit and prepayment made to an
agent of one of the provincial satellite TV stations partnered with the Company. The Company terminated its cooperation with this
TV station and its agent upon expiration of the 2014 contract on December 31, 2014. The remaining balance of this deposit and prepayment
as of December 31, 2015 was collected in January 2016.  

For advertising resources
purchase contracts signed by the Company with its resources providers, the Company was required to make deposits, which were either
applied to the contract amounts that were needed to be paid with the consent of the counterparty or to be refunded to the Company
of the remaining balance upon expiration of the cooperation. Overdue deposits represented the portion of the contractual deposits,
which related advertising resources purchase contracts had been completed as of each of the reporting dates with no further cooperation.
Based on the assessment of the collectability of these overdue deposits as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company
provided approximately US$649,000 and US$668,000 allowance for doubtful accounts, respectively, which was related to the deposits
of its internet advertising and TV advertising business segment. For the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016, no allowance
for doubtful accounts was provided or reversed. For the nine and three months ended September 30, 2015, approximately US$162,000
allowance for doubtful accounts was provided.

7.  Prepayments and deposit to suppliers   

The Company purchases
internet resources from large internet search engines and technical services from suppliers to attract more internet traffic to
its advertising portals and provide value-added services to its clients.  

Deposits to internet
resources providers are paid as contractual deposits to the Company s resources and services suppliers. As of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, deposit to internet resources providers primarily consisted of the contractual deposits paid for purchasing
internet resources from two of the Company s largest internet resources suppliers.  

According to the contracts
signed between the Company and its suppliers, the Company is normally required to pay the contract amounts in advance. These prepayments
will be transferred to cost of revenues when the related services are provided.  

Deposits to other
service providers consisted of an approximately US$0.75 million deposit to an intermediary service provider, which the Company
engaged to facilitate the Company to find, select and negotiate with its internet, TV or other media resource suppliers, and another
approximately US$0.75 million deposit for an advisory contract related to finding buyers for liansuo.com and new investors for
the Company. The contract with the intermediary service provider expired on April 30, 2016 and was extended to October 31, 2016.
In accordance with the extended contract, the deposit will be refunded to the Company no later than December 31, 2016.

Xia, also known as liansuo.com., which did not qualify for presentation as a discontinued operation, as it was not considered a
significant portion of the Company s internet advertising and data service business segment. The Company expects to consummate
the transaction before March 31, 2017 and does not expect to have any continued involvement with the entity after the disposal
date.  

The Company classified
the assets and liabilities of the disposal group as held for sale as of each reporting date and presented separately in the asset
and liability section, respectively. The assets and liabilities held by the disposal group are as follows:  

(1)  Liansuo.com (the disposal group) is a portion of the Company s internet advertising and data
service reporting unit that constitutes a business. Goodwill allocated to the disposal group is calculated based on the relative
fair value of liansuo.com and the remaining portion of the reporting unit that will be retained.   

(2)  Inter-company balances are part of the disposal group s assets or liabilities, but were eliminated
in deriving the consolidated financial statements.

10.  Long-term investments   

Equity method investments   

As of December 31,
2015, the Company beneficially owned 23.18% and 25.5% equity interest in Shenzhen Mingshan and Zhao Shang Ke Hubei, respectively.
Based on the facts of the significant decline in level of business activities during 2015, insufficient amount of working capital
and the lack of commitment from majority shareholders, these two investment affiliates had become dormant and the possibility of
the business recovery is remote. As a result, the Company reduced the carrying value of these investments to zero as of December
31, 2015.  

In 2015, the Company
co-incorporated ChinaNet Korea with three unaffiliated individuals and obtained 40% of the equity interest in ChinaNet Korea. During
the first fiscal quarter of 2016, the Company and other investors of ChinaNet Korea deregistered the entity and re-incorporated
it with new investors involved. The Company invested US$7,500 and obtained 15% of the equity interest in ChinaNet Korea through
the re-incorporation, which is now accounted for under cost method of accounting (See table below). ChinaNet Korea has not conducted
any business activities.  

Cost method investments   

As of September 30,
2016, the Company beneficially owned a 19% equity interest in ChinaNet Chuang Tou and Guohua Shiji, respectively, a 15% equity
interest in ChinaNet Korea and a 10% equity interest in Chuangshi Meiwei and Beijing Saturday, respectively. The Company accounts
for these investments under cost method of accounting. The following table summarizes the movement of the investments in cost method

13.  Deposit and prepayment for purchasing of software technology   

In May 2015, the Company entered into a contract to purchase
software products related to cloud video management system from an unrelated third party with a total contract amount of RMB9.5

CHINANET ONLINE HOLDINGS, INC.        NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)     

Due to certain restriction stipulated in the  Measures
for Overseas Investment Management  issued by the Ministry of Commerce of the PRC (the  MOFCOM ), the Company
and its investors experienced difficulties in obtaining approval for the transactions from the MOFCOM. As a result, on May 12,
2016, the Company terminated the security purchase agreements with the two investors, respectively. As agreed by the parties, if
the Company fails to fully refund the amounts before December 31, 2016, beginning on January 1, 2017, the Company will bear a 12%
annualized interest rate for the unpaid amounts and the amounts shall be refunded to the investors no later than December 31, 2017. 

1)      Income tax     

The entities within the Company file separate tax returns
in the respective tax jurisdictions in which they operate. 

i). The Company is incorporated in the state of Nevada.
Under the current law of Nevada, the Company is not subject to state corporate income tax. Following the Share Exchange, the Company
became a holding company and does not conduct any substantial operations of its own. No provision for federal corporate income
tax has been made in the financial statements as the Company has no assessable profits for the nine and three months ended September
30, 2016, or any prior periods. The Company does not provide for U.S. taxes or foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings
from its non-U.S. subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. If undistributed earnings were
distributed, foreign tax credits could become available under current law to reduce the resulting U.S. income tax liability. 

ii). China Net BVI was incorporated in the British Virgin
Islands ( BVI ). Under the current law of the BVI, China Net BVI is not subject to tax on income or capital gains.
Additionally, upon payments of dividends by China Net BVI to its shareholders, no BVI withholding tax will be imposed. 

iii). China Net HK was incorporated in Hong Kong and
does not conduct any substantial operations of its own. No provision for Hong Kong profits tax has been made in the financial statements
as China Net HK has no assessable profits for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 or any prior periods. Additionally,
upon payments of dividends by China Net HK to its shareholders, no Hong Kong withholding tax will be imposed. 

iv). The Company s PRC operating subsidiaries
and VIEs, being incorporated in the PRC, are governed by the income tax law of the PRC and is subject to PRC enterprise income
tax ( EIT ). The EIT rate of PRC is 25%, which applies to both domestic and foreign invested enterprises. 

l   In July 2012, Business Opportunity Online was approved by the related PRC governmental authorities
as a High and New Technology Enterprise under the current EIT law, and was approved by the local tax authorities of Beijing, the
PRC, to be entitled to a favorable statutory tax rate of 15% until December 31, 2014. During 2015, Business Opportunity Online
reapplied for the qualification as a High and New Technology Enterprise. In November 2015, Business Opportunity Online received
the formal certificate as a High and New Technology Enterprise, which enabled the entity to continue to enjoy the favorable statutory
tax rate of 15% until November 2018. Therefore, for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the applicable
income tax rate of Business Opportunity Online was 15%.   

l   Business Opportunity Online Hubei was approved by the related PRC governmental authorities to be
qualified as a software company and was approved by the local tax authorities of Xiaogan City, Hubei province, the PRC, to be entitled
to a EIT exemption for fiscal 2012 and a 50% reduction of its applicable EIT rate from 25% to 12.5% for its taxable income for
the succeeding three years through fiscal 2015, as its first profitable year was determined as fiscal 2011 instead of fiscal 2012
in August 2013 by the local tax authorities of Xiaogan City, Hubei province. Therefore, the applicable income tax rate for Business
Opportunity Online Hubei was 25% for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016, and was 12.5% for the nine and three months
ended September 30, 2015.   

l   The applicable income tax rate for other PRC operating entities of the Company was 25% for the
nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.   

CHINANET ONLINE HOLDINGS, INC.        NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)     

l   The current EIT law also imposed a 10% withholding income tax for dividends distributed by a foreign
invested enterprise to its immediate holding company outside China. A lower withholding tax rate will be applied if there is a
tax treaty arrangement between mainland China and the jurisdiction of the foreign holding company. Holding companies in Hong Kong,
for example, will be subject to a 5% withholding tax rate.   

For the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, all of the preferential income tax treatments enjoyed by the Company s PRC subsidiaries and VIEs were based on
the current applicable laws and regulations of the PRC and approved by the related government regulatory authorities and local
tax authorities where the Company s respective PRC subsidiaries and VIEs operate in. Business Opportunity Online and Business
Opportunity Online Hubei were most affected by these preferential income tax treatments within the structure of the Company. The
preferential income tax treatments are subject to change in accordance with the PRC government economic development policies and
regulations. These preferential income tax treatments are primarily determined by the regulation and policies of the PRC government
in the context of the overall economic policy and strategy. As a result, the uncertainty of theses preferential income tax treatments
are subject to, but not limited to, the PRC government policy on supporting any specific industry s development under the
outlook and strategy of overall macroeconomic development. 

2)      Turnover taxes and the relevant surcharges     

Service revenues provided by the Company s PRC
operating subsidiaries and VIEs were subject to Value Added Tax ( VAT ). VAT rate for provision of modern services
(other than lease of corporeal movables) is 6% and for small scale taxpayer, 3%. Therefore, for the nine and three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company s service revenues are subject to VAT at a rate of 6%, after deducting the VAT paid
for the services purchased from suppliers, or at a rate of 3% without any deduction of VAT paid for the services purchased from
suppliers. The surcharges of the VAT is 12%-14% of the VAT, depending on which tax jurisdiction the Company s PRC operating
subsidiaries and VIE operate in. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, taxes
payable consists of: 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, taxes payable
of approximately US$0.10 million was decreased due to disposal of a VIE during the period.

The Company s deferred tax liabilities at September
30, 2016 and changes for the nine months then ended were as follows: 

Deferred tax liabilities arose on the recognition of
the identifiable intangible assets acquired from acquisition transactions in previous years. Reversal for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 of approximately US$86,000 was due to amortization of the acquired intangible assets. 

The Company s deferred tax assets at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were as follows: 

The net operating losses carried forward incurred by
the Company (excluding its PRC operating subsidiary and VIEs) were approximately US$16,725,000 and US$14,903,000 at September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which loss carry forwards gradually expire over time, the last of which expires in 2036.
A full valuation allowance has been recorded because it is considered more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not
be realized through sufficient future earnings of the entity to which the operating losses relate. 

The net operating losses carried forward (excluding bad
debts provision, amortization of intangible assets acquired from business combinations and non-deductible expenses) incurred by
the Company s PRC subsidiary and VIEs were approximately US$17,008,000 and US$15,657,000 at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, respectively, which loss carry forwards gradually expire over time, the last of which expires in 2021. The related deferred
tax asset was calculated based on the respective net operating losses incurred by each of the PRC subsidiaries and VIEs and the
respective corresponding enacted tax rate that will be in effect in the period in which the losses are expected to be utilized.
The Company recorded approximately US$446,000 and US$148,000 net valuation allowance for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively, and recorded approximately US$149,000 and US$52,000 net valuation allowance for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, because it is considered more likely than not that this portion of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized through sufficient future earnings of the entities to which the operating losses relate. The Company
also utilized approximately US$267,000 and US$74,000 deferred tax assets for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016,
respectively. 

Full valuation allowance to bad debts provision related
deferred tax assets were recorded because it is considered more likely than not that this portion of deferred tax assets will not
be realized through bad debts verification by the local tax authorities where the PRC subsidiary and VIEs operate in. 

The Company s deferred tax assets and deferred
tax liabilities were attributable to different tax-paying components of the entity, which were under different tax jurisdictions.
Therefore, in accordance with ASC Topic 740  Income taxes , the non-current portion of deferred tax assets and deferred
tax liabilities were presented separately in the Company s balance sheets. 

CHINANET ONLINE HOLDINGS, INC.        NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)     

The tax authority of the PRC government conducts periodic
and ad hoc tax filing reviews on business enterprises operating in the PRC after those enterprises had completed their relevant
tax filings, hence the Company s tax filings may not be finalized. It is therefore uncertain as to whether the PRC tax authority
may take different views about the Company s tax filings which may lead to additional tax liabilities. 

19.  Long-term borrowing from a director   

Long-term borrowing from a director is a non-interest
bearing loan from a director of the Company relating to the original paid-in capital contribution in the Company s wholly-owned
subsidiary Rise King WFOE, which is not expected to be repaid within one year. 

20.  Restricted net assets   

As most of the Company s operations are conducted
through its PRC subsidiary and VIEs, the Company s ability to pay dividends is primarily dependent on receiving distributions
of funds from its PRC subsidiary and VIEs. Relevant PRC statutory laws and regulations permit payments of dividends by its PRC
subsidiary and VIEs only out of their retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and
regulations and after it has met the PRC requirements for appropriation to statutory reserves. Paid in capital of the PRC subsidiary
and VIEs included in the Company s consolidated net assets are also non-distributable for dividend purposes. 

In accordance with the PRC regulations on Enterprises
with Foreign Investment, a WFOE established in the PRC is required to provide certain statutory reserves, namely general reserve
fund, the enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund which are appropriated from net profit as reported in the
enterprise s PRC statutory accounts. A WFOE is required to allocate at least 10% of its annual after-tax profit to the general
reserve until such reserve has reached 50% of its registered capital based on the enterprise s PRC statutory accounts. Appropriations
to the enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund are at the discretion of the board of directors. The aforementioned
reserves can only be used for specific purposes and are not distributable as cash dividends. Rise King WFOE is subject to the above
mandated restrictions on distributable profits. Additionally, in accordance with the Company Law of the PRC, a domestic enterprise
is required to provide a statutory common reserve of at least 10% of its annual after-tax profit until such reserve has reached
50% of its registered capital based on the enterprise s PRC statutory accounts. A domestic enterprise is also required to
provide for a discretionary surplus reserve, at the discretion of the board of directors. The aforementioned reserves can only
be used for specific purposes and are not distributable as cash dividends. All of the Company s PRC VIEs are subject to the
above mandated restrictions on distributable profits. 

As a result of these PRC laws and regulations, the Company s
PRC subsidiary and VIEs are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to the Company. As of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, net assets restricted in the aggregate, which include paid-in capital and statutory reserve funds
of the Company s PRC subsidiary and VIEs that are included in the Company s consolidated net assets, was approximately
US$8.1 million and US$6.7 million, respectively. 

The current PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law also imposed
a 10% withholding income tax for dividends distributed by a foreign invested enterprise to its immediate holding company outside
China. A lower withholding tax rate will be applied if there is a tax treaty arrangement between mainland China and the jurisdiction
of the foreign holding company. Holding companies in Hong Kong, for example, will be subject to a 5% rate. 

The ability of the Company s PRC subsidiary and
VIEs to make dividends and other payments to the Company may also be restricted by changes in applicable foreign exchange and other
laws and regulations. 

Foreign currency exchange regulation in China is primarily
governed by the following rules: 

l   Administration Rules of the Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange (1996), or the Administration
Rules.   

Currently, under the Administration Rules, Renminbi is
freely convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, interest payments, trade and service related
foreign exchange transactions, but not for capital account items, such as direct investments, loans, repatriation of investments
and investments in securities outside of China, unless the prior approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (the
 SAFE ) is obtained and prior registration with the SAFE is made. Foreign-invested enterprises like Rise King WFOE
that need foreign exchange for the distribution of profits to its shareholders may effect payment from their foreign exchange accounts
or purchase and pay foreign exchange rates at the designated foreign exchange banks to their foreign shareholders by producing
board resolutions for such profit distribution. Based on their needs, foreign-invested enterprises are permitted to open foreign
exchange settlement accounts for current account receipts and payments of foreign exchange along with specialized accounts for
capital account receipts and payments of foreign exchange at certain designated foreign exchange banks. 

CHINANET ONLINE HOLDINGS, INC.        NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)     

Although the current Exchange Rules allow the convertibility
of Chinese Renminbi into foreign currency for current account items, conversion of Chinese Renminbi into foreign exchange for capital
items, such as foreign direct investment, loans or securities, requires the approval of SAFE, which is under the authority of the
People s Bank of China. These approvals, however, do not guarantee the availability of foreign currency conversion. The Company
cannot be sure that it will be able to obtain all required conversion approvals for its operations or the Chinese regulatory authorities
will not impose greater restrictions on the convertibility of Chinese Renminbi in the future. Currently, most of the Company s
retained earnings are generated in Renminbi. Any future restrictions on currency exchanges may limit the Company s ability
to use its retained earnings generated in Renminbi to make dividends or other payments in U.S. dollars or fund possible business
activities outside China. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there
was approximately US$19.9 million and US$22.9 million retained earnings in the aggregate, respectively, which was generated by
the Company s PRC subsidiary and VIEs in Renminbi included in the Company s consolidated net assets, aside from US$2.6
million and US$2.8 million of statutory reserve funds as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, that may be
affected by increased restrictions on currency exchanges in the future, and accordingly, may further limit the Company s
PRC subsidiary s and VIEs  ability to make dividends or other payments in U.S. dollars to the Company, in addition
to the approximately US$8.1 million and US$6.7 million of restricted net assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
as discussed above. 

21.  Related party transactions   

Revenue from related parties:  

22.  Employee defined contribution plan   

Full time employees of the Company in the PRC participate
in a government mandated defined contribution plan, pursuant to which certain pension benefits, medical care, employee housing
fund and other welfare benefits are provided to employees. Chinese labor regulations require that the PRC subsidiaries of the Company
make contributions to the government for these benefits based on certain percentages of the employees  salaries. The employee
benefits were expensed as incurred. The Company has no legal obligation for the benefits beyond the contributions made. The total
amounts for such employee benefits were approximately US$456,000 and US$467,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively. The total amounts for such employee benefits were approximately US$158,000 and US$188,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

23.  Concentration of risk   

Credit risk   

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company
to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and prepayments
and deposits to suppliers. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, substantially all of the Company s cash and cash
equivalents were held by major financial institutions located in Mainland China, which management believes are of high credit quality.
For accounts receivables, the Company extends credit based on an evaluation of the customer s financial condition, generally
without requiring collateral or other security. In order to minimize the credit risk, the Company delegated a team responsible
for credit approvals and other monitoring procedures to ensure that follow-up action is taken to recover overdue debts. Further,
the Company reviews the recoverable amount of each individual trade debt at each balance sheet date to ensure that adequate allowances
are made for doubtful accounts. In this regard, the Company considers that the Company s credit risk for accounts receivables
is significantly reduced. For prepayments and deposits to suppliers, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, majority of
the prepayments and deposits to suppliers were paid for purchase services from two of the largest search engine companies in the
PRC, which management believes are of high credit quality. 

Risk arising from operations in foreign
countries   

All of the Company s operations are conducted within
the PRC. The Company s operations in the PRC are subject to various political, economic, and other risks and uncertainties
inherent in the PRC. Among other risks, the Company s operations in the PRC are subject to the risks of restrictions on transfer
of funds, changing taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions; and political conditions and governmental regulations. 

Currency convertibility risk    

Significant part of the Company s businesses is
transacted in RMB, which is not freely convertible into foreign currencies. All foreign exchange transactions take place either
through the People s Bank of China or other banks authorized to buy and sell foreign currencies at the exchange rates quoted
by the People s Bank of China. Approval of foreign currency payments by the People s Bank of China or other regulatory
institutions requires submitting a payment application form together with suppliers  invoices and signed contracts. These
exchange control measures imposed by the PRC government authorities may restrict the ability of the Company s PRC subsidiary
and VIEs to transfer its net assets, which to the Company through loans, advances or cash dividends. 

Concentration of customers   

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, two customers
individually accounted for 14% and 12% of the Company s revenues. Except for the aforementioned customers, there was no other
single customer who accounted for more than 10% of the Company s revenues for the nine or three months ended September 30,
2016. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, two customers
individually accounted for 15% and 13% of the Company s revenues, respectively. For the three months ended September 30,
2015, one of the two customers individually accounted for 11% of the Company s revenues. Except for the aforementioned customers,
there was no other single customer who accounted for more than 10% of the Company s revenues for the nine or three months
ended September 30, 2015. 

As of September 30, 2016, two customers individually
accounted for 29% and 14% of the Company s accounts receivables, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, the same two customers
individually accounted for 17% and 24% of the Company s accounts receivables, respectively. Except for the aforementioned,
there was no other single customer who accounted for more than 10% of the Company s accounts receivable as of September 30,
2016 or December 31, 2015. 

Concentration of suppliers   

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, two suppliers
individually accounted for 28% and 37% of the Company s cost of revenues, respectively. For the three months ended September
30, 2016, the same two suppliers individually accounted for 52% and 16% of the Company s cost of revenues, respectively.
Except for the afore-mentioned, there was no other single supplier who accounted for more than 10% of the Company s cost
of revenues for the nine or three months ended September 30, 2016.

24.  Commitments and contingencies   

The following table sets forth the Company s operating
lease commitment as of September 30, 2016:

million (approximately US$1.4 million). As of September 30, 2016, the Company had paid in the aggregate of RMB6.65 million (approximately

the two parties, if the Company is able to achieve 50% of the minimum consumption amount. If the Company fails to achieve 50% of
the minimum consumption amount, the Company is not eligible to enjoy any discount. The contract expired on June 12, 2016, based
on the final agreed compensation plan between the two parties, the Company compensated the supplier  approximately US$0.13 million

Overview     

We were incorporated in the State
of Texas in April 2006 and re-domiciled to become a Nevada corporation in October 2006. On June 26, 2009, we consummated a share
exchange transaction with China Net Online Media Group Limited (the  Share Exchange ), a company organized under the
laws of British Virgin Islands ( China Net BVI ). As a result of the Share Exchange, China Net BVI became a wholly
owned subsidiary of us and we are now a holding company, which, through certain contractual arrangements with operating entities
in the PRC, is engaged in providing advertising, marketing, communication, online-to-offline (O2O) sales channel expansion and
the related data services to SMEs in China and networking services for entrepreneurs in the PRC. 

Through our PRC operating subsidiaries
and VIEs, we primarily operate a one-stop services for our clients on our integrated service platform, primarily including Omni-channel
precision advertising and marketing system, CloundX and data analysis management system. Our Omni-channel precision advertising
and marketing system, primarily consists of digital advertising and marketing portals, include internet and mobile, and our other
non-digital advertising units, such as TV. We provide and monitor varieties of advertising and marketing campaigns through this
service system which generates effective sales leads through the combination of the Internet, mobile, content and others, including
TV and schemes, we also provide search engine marketing services through this system to maximize market exposure and effectiveness
for our clients. Our data analysis management system is an information and data analysis portal for SMEs or entrepreneurs who plans
to start their own business, helping them for a higher survival and faster deal closing rate. It is built to further expand our
service and data-link to assist our clients in developing their sales both online and offline, so that the overall service platform
can create a traceable looped online to offline (O2O) ecosystem for our clients in their ground sales expansion throughout the
cities in the PRC. During the past two years, we have been developing our SMEs intelligent operation and marketing data service
applications, which consists of several online cloud technology based advertising and marketing, lead management, elite store management,
client membership management and other administrative operational management tools specifically designed for small business in
China to match their simplicity. We are intending to use these applications to create social community-based consumption ecosystem,
by deploying our Big Data technologies and analyze both online and offline businesses  operational and customers  consumption
data to help the SMEs improve their marketing efficiency and sales effectiveness with their target customers. 

On August 18, 2016, we filed
a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Nevada to effect a one-for-two and
one-half (1 for 2.5) reverse stock split of the Company s common stock (the  Common Stock ), which became
effective on August 19, 2016 (the  Reverse Stock Split ). When the Reverse Stock Split became effective, each two
and one-half shares of issued and outstanding Common Stock were converted into one newly issued and outstanding share of
Common Stock. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse stock split. Any fractional shares of Common
Stock that would have otherwise resulted from the reverse stock split were rounded up to the nearest full share. The Reverse
Stock Split did not change the par value of the Common Stock and had no effect on the number of authorized shares of Common
Stock of the Company. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, 30,395,722 shares of Common Stock that were issued and
outstanding at August 19, 2016 was reduced to 12,158,542 shares of Common Stock (taking into account the rounding of
fractional shares). All number of shares and per share data have been retroactively restated to reflect the 1 for 2.5
reverse stock split of the Company wherever applicable for all the periods presented.

interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions
to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X, as promulgated by the SEC, and include the accounts of our Company, and all of our
subsidiaries and VIEs. We prepare financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the financial reporting period. We continually evaluate
these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information, our own historical experience and various other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the
financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies require higher degrees

and US$8.5 million, respectively, for the same period last year, which was primarily due to increase in revenues from search engine
marketing service during the periods.

sales lead information, providing search engine marketing ( SEM ) service and other related value added technical support

Management considers revenues generated
from internet advertising and data service, SEM services and other related technical services as one aggregate business operation
and relies upon the consolidated results of all the operations in this business unit to make decisions about allocating resources
and evaluating performance. 

l   Internet advertising and data service revenues was approximately US$13.7 million for both the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, Internet advertising and data service
revenues decreased to US$4.39 million from US$5.49 million for the same period in 2015. We believe that the temporary decrease
in our internet advertising and data service revenues during the third quarter of 2016 reflected our strategy to further upgrading
our internet advertising, marketing and data services to our larger SME clients and eliminating smaller and non-profitable clients.
During 2016, we optimized our online promotion analysis and cost control system to provide more data and feedback to our users,
which is especially helpful to our larger clients, we also optimized our online promotion tactics to improve cost efficiency, which
helped the Company and our clients achieve more accurate promotion and placement effects with acceptable costs, thereby increasing
sales lead conversion rate and overall client satisfaction with our services. As a result, along with eliminating smaller and non-profitable
clients, the number of larger customers served by us continued to increase, we believe that upgrading existing services and launching
new services will help increase our market penetration in the SME segment, thereby continuing to increase our recurring revenues
in future periods.   

l   Revenues generated from technical services offered by Rise King WFOE were US$0.02 million and US$nil
for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to US$0.30 million and US$0.08 million for the same
periods in 2015, respectively.   

l   Revenue generated from search engine marketing services for the nine and three months ended September
30, 2016 was approximately US$11.7 million and US$7.5 million, respectively, compared to US$8.5 million and US$2.9 million for
the same periods in 2015, respectively. This enhanced third-party search engine marketing service is designed to help our clients
select the most effective key words and to prioritize the ranking of the anticipated search engine results on selected key words
in order to increase the sales lead conversion rate for our clients  business promotion on both mobile and PC searches. Management
believes this service will be an effective supplement to the internet advertising and data service provided to our clients, and
will help increase the overall satisfaction with our services, thereby increasing recurring revenues and the number of clients
in the future.   

l   As discussed in our 2015 Form 10-K, we exited our bank kiosk advertisement business segment in
the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015. We did not generate any TV advertisement revenues for the nine and three months ended September
30, 2016, since we did not finalize any TV advertisement resources contracts with suppliers during the periods. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, our total revenues generated from TV and bank kiosk advertisement was approximately US$1.26 million,
of which approximately US$1.10 million was generated from TV advertisement and US$0.16 million was generated from bank kiosk advertisement.
For the three months ended September 30, 2015, our total revenues generated from TV and bank kiosk advertisement was approximately
US$0.04 million, of which approximately US$0.02 million was generated form TV advertisement and US$0.02 million was generated from
bank kiosk advertisement.   

Cost of revenues 

Our cost of revenues consisted
of costs directly related to the offering of our advertising, marketing and data services and technical services. The following
table sets forth our cost of revenues, divided into five segments, by amount and gross profit ratio for the periods indicated,
with inter-segment transactions eliminated: 

Cost of revenues:   Our total cost of revenues
increased to US$19.3 million and US$9.9 million, respectively, for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016, compared
to US$19.2 million and US$7.0 million, respectively, for the same period in 2015. The increase in our total cost of revenues for
both periods were primarily due to the increase in costs associated with providing search engine marketing service during the periods,
which was in line with the increase in the related revenues as discussed above, and the increase in our search engine marketing
cost of revenues for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 was partially offset by the decrease in cost of revenues
associated with providing internet advertisement and data service, due to the improvement in gross margin of this business in 2016. Our
cost of revenues related to our advertising, marketing and data services primarily consists of internet resources purchased from
key search engines and technical services providers related to lead generation, sponsored search and other direct cost associated
with providing services. 

l   For internet advertising and data service, cost associated with obtaining internet resources was
the largest component of our cost of revenues, accounting for over 80% of our total internet advertising and data service cost
of revenues. We purchased these internet resources from other well-known search engines and portal websites in China, such as:
Baidu, Qihu 360 and Sohu (Sogou). The purchase of these internet resources in large volumes allowed us to negotiate discounts with
our suppliers. For the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016, our total cost of revenues for internet advertising and
data service was approximately US$7.86 million and US$2.53 million, respectively, compared to US$9.47 million and US$3.81 million
for the same periods last year, respectively. For the nine and three months ended September 30, 2015, we also accrued an approximately
US$0.41 million contingent additional internet resources cost that might be charged by our supplier due to not meeting the minimum
consumption amount requirement set forth in the purchase contract, which amount was subsequently reduced to US$0.13 million based
on the final agreement reached between the two parties. During 2016, we continued developing our precision advertising and marketing
system, CloudX and optimized our digital marketing tactics by conglomerating different products of a single large customer and
relatively increasing our classified segment and industry level marketing scheme to improve cost efficiency, which helped us and
our clients achieve lead results and effects with acceptable or lower costs. As a result, excluding the contingent additional cost
accrued for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2015, the gross margin for our internet advertising and data service
revenues increased to 43% and 42% for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to 31% for both
the nine and three months ended September 30, 2015.   

l   Costs for search engine marketing services were direct internet resource costs consumed for search
engine marketing services provided to clients as described above. We normally charge our clients service fees for this service
as a certain percentage of the related direct cost consumed, which is normally 2%-3%. Gross margin of this service for the nine
and three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately 2.4%-3%.   

Gross Profit 

As a result of the foregoing, our
gross profit increased to US$6.13 million and US$2.03 million, respectively, for the nine and three months ended September
30, 2016, from US$4.57 million and US$1.45 million, respectively, for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2015. Our
overall gross margin increased to 24% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 19% for the same period last year,
which was primarily due to the improvement in gross margin of our internet advertising and data service business, which was 43%
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 31% for the same period last year. For the three months ended September
30, 2016, gross margin of our internet advertising and data service business also improved significantly to 42% from 31% for the
same period last year. However, due to the increase in relative lower margin revenues from search engine marketing services during
the period, which constituted approximately 63% of the total revenues during the period, compared to 34% of the total revenues
for the same period last year, our overall gross margin was 17% for both the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Operating Expenses and Net Loss 

Our operating expenses consist
of sales and marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses. The following
tables set forth our operating expenses, divided into their major categories by amount and as a percentage of our total revenues
for the periods indicated. 

We exited our brand management
and sales channel building business segment in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015, which qualified for presentation as a discontinued
operation. The results of operation of this business was reported in discontinued operation as a separate component in the condensed
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for all periods presented. As a result, operating expenses amounts
in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the nine and three months ended September 30,
2015 have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the effect of reclassification of results of operations reported in discontinued
operation as a separate component. 

Operating Expenses:   Our total operating
expenses decreased to US$9.89 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from US$10.44 million for the
same period of 2015. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, our total operating expenses decreased to US$3.39 million from
US$4.01 million for the same period of 2015. 

l   Sales and marketing expenses: Sales and marketing expenses decreased to US$3.07 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 from US$3.44 million for the same period of 2015. For the three months ended September
30, 2016, sales and marketing expenses decreased to US$1.13 million from US$1.21 million for the same period of 2015. Our sales
and marketing expenses primarily consist of advertising expenses for brand development that we pay to different media outlets for
the promotion and marketing of our advertising web portals, other advertising and promotional expenses, staff salaries, staff benefits,
performance bonuses, travelling expenses, communication expenses and other general office expenses of our sales department. For
the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016, the decrease in our sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to the decrease
in server hosting expenses and other general office expenses of our sales department as compared with the same periods last year.   

l   General and administrative expenses: General and administrative expenses decreased to US$5.29 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from US$5.35 million for the same period in 2015. For the three months ended
September 30, 2016, general and administrative expenses decreased to US$1.75 million from US$2.21 million for the same period of
2015. Our general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries and benefits for management, accounting and administrative
personnel, office rentals, depreciation and amortization, professional service fees, maintenance, utilities and other office expenses.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the change in our general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the following
reasons: (1) the decrease in general administrative expenses, such as: professional service expenses, salary and benefit expenses,
office rental and other general office expenses of approximately US$0.09 million; and (2) the net effect of increase in allowances
for doubtful accounts, due to reversal of allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately US$0.03 million during the first nine
months of 2015 related to continuing operations. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the change in our general and administrative
expenses was primarily due to the following reasons: (1) the decrease in general administrative expenses, such as: professional
service expenses, salary and benefit expenses, office rental and other general office expenses of approximately US$0.35 million;
and (2) the net effect of decrease in allowances for doubtful accounts, due to provision of allowance for doubtful accounts of
approximately US$0.11 million during the three months ended September 30, 2015 related to continuing operations, which resulted
in a net decrease in general and administration expenses of US$0.46 million, as compared to the same period in 2015.   

l   Research and development expenses: Research and development expenses were US$1.53 million and US$0.51
million for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to US$1.66 million and US$0.60 million for
the nine and three months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Our research and development expenses primarily consist
of salaries and benefits for the research and development staff, equipment depreciation expenses, and office utilities and supplies
allocated to our research and development department.

Interest expense:   For
the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, interest expense we paid were primarily related to the short-term

Restricted Net Assets 

As most of our operations are conducted
through our PRC subsidiary and VIEs, our ability to pay dividends is primarily dependent on receiving distributions of funds from
our PRC subsidiary and VIEs. Relevant PRC statutory laws and regulations permit payments of dividends by our PRC subsidiary and
VIEs only out of their retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations and
after it has met the PRC requirements for appropriation to statutory reserves. Paid in capital of the PRC subsidiary and VIEs included
in our consolidated net assets are also not distributable for dividend purposes. 

In accordance with the PRC regulations
on Enterprises with Foreign Investment, a WFOE established in the PRC is required to provide certain statutory reserves, namely
general reserve fund, the enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund which are appropriated from net profit as
reported in the enterprise s PRC statutory accounts. A WFOE is required to allocate at least 10% of its annual after-tax
profit to the general reserve until such reserve has reached 50% of its registered capital based on the enterprise s PRC
statutory accounts. Appropriations to the enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund are at the discretion of the
board of directors. The aforementioned reserves can only be used for specific purposes and are not distributable as cash dividends.
Rise King WFOE is subject to the above mandated restrictions on distributable profits. Additionally, in accordance with the Company
Law of the PRC, a domestic enterprise is required to provide a statutory common reserve of at least 10% of its annual after-tax
profit until such reserve has reached 50% of its registered capital based on the enterprise s PRC statutory accounts. A domestic
enterprise is also required to provide for a discretionary surplus reserve, at the discretion of the board of directors. The aforementioned
reserves can only be used for specific purposes and are not distributable as cash dividends. All of our PRC VIEs are subject to
the above mandated restrictions on distributable profits. 

As a result of these PRC laws and
regulations, our PRC subsidiary and VIEs are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to us. As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, net assets restricted in the aggregate, which includes paid-in capital and statutory
reserve funds of our PRC subsidiary and VIEs that are included in our consolidated net assets, was approximately US$8.1 million
and US$6.7 million, respectively. 

The current PRC Enterprise Income
Tax Law also imposed a 10% withholding income tax for dividends distributed by a foreign invested enterprise to its immediate holding
company outside China. A lower withholding tax rate will be applied if there is a tax treaty arrangement between mainland China
and the jurisdiction of the foreign holding company. Holding companies in Hong Kong, for example, will be subject to a 5% rate. 

The ability of our PRC subsidiaries
to make dividends and other payments to us may also be restricted by changes in applicable foreign exchange and other laws and
regulations. 

Foreign currency exchange regulation
in China is primarily governed by the following rules: 

l   Administration Rules of the Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange (1996), or the Administration
Rules.   

Currently, under the Administration
Rules, Renminbi is freely convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, interest payments, trade
and service related foreign exchange transactions, but not for capital account items, such as direct investments, loans, repatriation
of investments and investments in securities outside of China, unless the prior approval of the State Administration of Foreign
Exchange (the  SAFE ) is obtained and prior registration with the SAFE is made. Foreign-invested enterprises like Rise
King WFOE that need foreign exchange for the distribution of profits to its shareholders may effect payment from their foreign
exchange accounts or purchase and pay foreign exchange rates at the designated foreign exchange banks to their foreign shareholders
by producing board resolutions for such profit distribution. Based on their needs, foreign-invested enterprises are permitted to
open foreign exchange settlement accounts for current account receipts and payments of foreign exchange along with specialized
accounts for capital account receipts and payments of foreign exchange at certain designated foreign exchange banks. 

Although the current Exchange Rules
allow the convertibility of Chinese Renminbi into foreign currency for current account items, conversion of Chinese Renminbi into
foreign exchange for capital items, such as foreign direct investment, loans or securities, requires the approval of SAFE, which
is under the authority of the People s Bank of China. These approvals, however, do not guarantee the availability of foreign
currency conversion. We cannot be sure that it will be able to obtain all required conversion approvals for our operations or the
Chinese regulatory authorities will not impose greater restrictions on the convertibility of Chinese Renminbi in the future. Currently,
most of our retained earnings are generated in Renminbi. Any future restrictions on currency exchanges may limit our ability to
use retained earnings generated in Renminbi to make dividends or other payments in U.S. dollars or fund possible business activities
outside China. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, there were approximately US$19.9 million and US$22.9 million retained earnings in the aggregate, respectively, which
were generated by our PRC subsidiary and VIEs in Renminbi included in our consolidated net assets, aside from US$2.6 million and
US$2.8 million of statutory reserve funds as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, that may be affected by
increased restrictions on currency exchanges in the future, and accordingly, may further limit our PRC subsidiary s or VIEs 
ability to make dividends or other payments in U.S. dollars to us, in addition to the approximately US$8.1 million and US$6.7 million
of restricted net assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, as discussed above.

required disclosure.
