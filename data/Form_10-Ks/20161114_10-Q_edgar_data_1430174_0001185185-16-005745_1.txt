CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Oro East Mining, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the  Company ), contains  forward-looking statements,  as defined in the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as  may ,  will ,  should ,  could ,  expects ,  plans ,  intends ,  anticipates ,  believes ,  estimates ,  predicts ,  potential  or  continue  or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology.  These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements about our market opportunity, our strategies, competition, expected activities and expenditures as we pursue our business plan, and the adequacy of our available cash resources.  Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.  Actual results may differ materially from the predictions discussed in these forward-looking statements.  The economic environment within which we operate could materially affect our actual results. Additional factors that could materially affect these forward-looking statements and/or predictions include, among other things: the volatility of minerals prices, the possibility that exploration efforts will not yield economically recoverable quantities of minerals, accidents and other risks associated with mineral exploration and development operations, the risk that the Company will encounter unanticipated geological factors, the Company s need for and ability to obtain additional financing, the possibility that the Company may not be able to secure permitting and other governmental clearances necessary to carry out the Company s exploration and development plans, the exercise of the approximately 78% control the Company s voting securities the Company s Chief Executive Officer, Tian Qing Chen, holds, other factors over which we have little or no control; and other factors discussed in the Company s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).

Our management has included projections and estimates in this Form 10-Q, which are based primarily on management s experience in the industry, assessments of our results of operations, discussions and negotiations with third parties and a review of information filed by our competitors with the SEC or otherwise publicly available.  We caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made.  We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.

(Unaudited)

NOTE 1          ORGANIZATION, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a)         Basis of Presentation

The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements are unaudited and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the opinion of management, all adjustments for a fair statement of the results and operations and financial position for the interim periods presented have been included. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.   The September 30, 2016 interim consolidated financial statements presented herein may not be indicative of the results of the Company for the year ending December 31, 2016. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016.

(b)         Equity Method Investments

The Company accounts for its 30% owned corporate joint venture using the equity method of accounting. The Company records its share of the earnings (loss) in the consolidated statements of operations, and the carrying value of the joint venture is recorded in the consolidated balance sheets. Dividends received from the joint venture are recorded as dividends income, and the carrying value of the joint venture is reduced by the amount of the dividends received.

(c)         Reclassification

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.

NOTE 2          GOING CONCERN

The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the Company will realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $10,456,933 and a negative working capital of $3,904,798 at September 30, 2016. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management s plan includes obtaining additional funds by equity and debt financing and/or related party advances, but there is no assurance of additional funding being available. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise as a result of this uncertainty.

NOTE 3          EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS

The Company has an interest in Magnique, Inc., a California corporate joint venture with a foreign company that is primary involved in the manufacturing and sale of mineral-infused holistic wellness products. The investment is accounted for using the equity method and represents a 30% ownership in the joint venture (see Note 7). Condensed and unaudited financial information for the joint venture is as follow:

NOTE 5          CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE

A summary of the convertible notes payable, which are all held by an unrelated party, is as below:

(1)   
 
 The notes were extended from their previous maturity dates with the conversion price changed to the market price on the dates they were extended. All notes with maturities on or before December 31, 2016 were extended during the quarter ended June 30, 2016. All notes with maturities on or after January 1, 2017 but before April 1, 2017 were extended during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. All notes with maturities on or after April 1, 2017 were extended subsequent to September 30, 2016 (see Note 8). The Company analyzed the terms modification of the convertible notes under  ASC 470-60, Troubled Debt Restructurings , and  ASC 470-50, Extinguishment of Debt , and determined that the creditors had not granted a concession and the modifications were substantial, which qualified for Extinguishment accounting.  The Company amortized the remaining discount on the convertible notes to interest expense on the dates of the conversion.  There were no direct costs or fees associated with the terms modification of the convertible notes. The Company also analyzed the modified conversion option under  ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , and determined that the instrument does not qualify for derivative accounting and that the instrument does not have a beneficial conversion feature and there were no losses on the debt extinguishments recorded.

Business Overview

Magnique, Inc., the Company s joint venture with HangZhou Ci Xiao Tang Technology Co. Ltd., has continued to remain the main focus this past quarter, given the vigor of business and demand of the mineral-infused holistic wellness home care products. Magnique, Inc. has set up a showroom and gallery in Burlingame, California and a warehouse in Hayward, California. Magnique sells personal and home care products that are infused with magnets and magnetized minerals, pursuant to a traditional Chinese philosophy of wellness that uses magnetism as a form of wellness practice and holistic personal care.

Negotiations are in the works to resume gold ore production and ongoing exploration and mine development at both Carson Hill and Red Bank, currently the Company s two main mineral projects.

With its educational focus, the venture attracts students on organized school field trips. The venture was slow over the summer months but is expected to pick up in the autumn and spring seasons, correspondent with academic years when schools are in session.

Results of Operations

The following is a summary of the Company s operation results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

Operating expenses decreased by about $174,000 and $298,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and was due to a decrease of $174,000 and $298,000 in general and administrative expenses, respectively.  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, general and administrative expenses decreased due to the decrease of about $43,000 and $80,000 in payroll expense, $104,000 and $127,000 in share-based compensation, $6,000  and $26,000 in professional fees, and $21,000 and $65,000 in other operating expenses, respectively.

Other expenses decreased by about $19,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 due to about $63,000 decrease in interest expenses offset by about $44,000 increase in allocated loss from the equity method investments. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, other expenses increased by about $42,000 due to about $36,000 and $6,000 increase in allocated loss from the equity method investments and interest expenses, respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Going Concern

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had a total of $180,513 and $196,998 in current assets including $24,915 and $7,149 of cash, respectively.  Decrease of about $16,000 in total current assets was due to about $18,000 increase in cash, which is offset by $34,000 decrease in prepaid expense for the first nine months of 2016.  The Company also had $4,085,311 and $3,558,487 current liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Increase of about $527,000 in total current liabilities was mainly due to the increase of about $194,000, $20,000, $398,000 and $1,000 in convertible notes, short-term notes, accrued liabilities and related party advance, and the decrease of $15,000, $3,000, and $68,000 in note payable, capital lease obligation and accounts payable, respectively. 

The following is a summary of the Company's cash flows provided by (used in) operating and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and the cash flow provided by the shareholder advances and debt and equity financing.  We believe that further debt and equity financing is needed to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements through the next 12 months.

Total cash increased by about $18,000 before the effect of exchange rate was mainly due to about $213,000 and $1,000 of cash provided by convertible note and short-term note issuance and related party advance, and $178,000 and $18,000 of cash used for funding the operations and repayment of debts, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Critical Accounting Policies

Except for the implementation of the equity method for the 30% owned corporate joint venture during the quarter ended June 30, 2016, there have been no material changes in the critical accounting policies since December 31, 2015.

Item  4.               CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
