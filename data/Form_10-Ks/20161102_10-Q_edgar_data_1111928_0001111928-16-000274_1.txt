  1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared by IPG Photonics Corporation, or "IPG", "its" or the "Company". Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The consolidated financial statements include the Company's accounts and those of its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances have been eliminated in consolidation. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  In the opinion of the Company's management, the unaudited financial information for the interim periods presented reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The results reported in these consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the entire year. 
  The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the time of filing this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with the SEC. 
   
  2. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting" ("ASU 2016-09"). The standard is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including income tax impact, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. The impact that the standard will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements will depend upon certain criteria including the timing of the exercise and release of equity instruments, the value realized upon exercise or release of equity instruments and the fair value of the equity instruments when they were granted. The excess tax benefit from the exercise of equity instruments was   $2,844   and   $5,822   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)" ("ASU 2016-02"). The standard requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with lease terms greater than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have and does not expect it to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, "Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" ("ASU 2016-01"). The standard addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have and does not expect it to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued amended guidance that clarifies that in a classified statement of financial position, an entity shall classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as non-current amounts. The new guidance supersedes ASC 740-10-45-5 which required the deferred tax assets and liabilities for a particular tax jurisdiction be allocated between current and non-current deferred tax assets for that tax jurisdiction on the basis of the financial accounting classification of the related asset or liability for which the temporary difference existed. The new standard will become effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2017. The Company has determined that the standard will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption. Current deferred tax assets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were   $24,620   and   $20,346  , respectively. Current deferred tax liabilities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were   $4,047   and   $3,190  , respectively. 
   In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 ("ASU 2014-09") "Revenue from Contracts with Customers." ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in "Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)", and requires entities to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the 
  consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. As currently issued and

amended, ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods 
  within that reporting period, though early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on its consolidated financial statements and does not expect it to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 
   
  3. INVENTORIES 
  Inventories consist of the following: 

The Company recorded inventory provisions totaling   $6,518   and   $4,336   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $16,243   and   $11,347   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. These provisions relate to the recoverability of the value of inventories due to technological changes and excess quantities. These provisions are reported as a reduction to components and raw materials and finished components and devices. 
   
  4. ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER LIABILITIES 
  Accrued expenses and other liabilities consist of the following: 

5. FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS 
  The Company's borrowings under existing financing arrangements consist of the following: 

The U.S. and Euro lines-of-credit are available to certain foreign subsidiaries and allow for borrowings in the local currencies of those subsidiaries. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were no amounts drawn on the U.S. line-of-credit, and there were   $225   and   $2,828  , respectively, of guarantees issued against the facility which reduces the amount of the facility available to draw. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were no amounts drawn on the Euro line-of-credit, and there were   $7,985   and   $8,221  , respectively, of guarantees issued against the facility which reduces the amount of the facility available to draw.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) 
  (In thousands, except share and per share data) 

At   September 30, 2016  , the amount due on the   two   long-term notes was   $41,620   of which   $3,188   is the current portion. The company has an unsecured note of   $23,453   of which   $1,188   is the current portion. The interest on this unsecured note is variable at   1.20%   above the LIBOR rate and is fixed using an interest rate swap at   2.85%   per annum. The unsecured note matures in May 2023, at which time the outstanding debt balance will be   $15,438  . The Company has another note that is secured by the Company's corporate aircraft of   $18,167   of which   $2,000   is the current portion. The interest rate on this secured note is fixed at   2.81%   per annum and the collateralized long-term note matures in October 2019, at which time the outstanding debt balance will be   $12,000  .  
   
  6. NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO IPG PHOTONICS CORPORATION PER SHARE 
  The following table sets forth the computation of diluted net income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation per share: 

For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, the computation of diluted weighted average common shares excludes common stock equivalents of   52,100   shares and   9,000   shares which includes restricted stock units ("RSUs") of   2,500   and   1,600   and performance stock units ("PSUs") of   0   and   4,300  , respectively. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, the computation of diluted weighted average common shares excludes common stock equivalents of   80,600   and   40,600   shares which includes RSUs of   20,900   and   24,200   and PSUs of   3,300   and   9,400  , respectively. These common stock equivalents are excluded because the effect of including them would be anti-dilutive.  
  On July 28, 2016, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (the  Program ) to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued upon exercise or release under the Company's various employee and director equity compensation and employee stock purchase plans. Under the Program, the Company's management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees and directors under its various employee and director equity compensation and employee stock purchase plans from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017. The Program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than   $100,000   over a period ending June 30, 2018.  
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased   41,800   shares of its common stock with an average price of   $83.33   per share in the open market. The impact on the reduction of weighted average shares for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   6,090   shares and   2,044   shares, respectively. There were no previous Program repurchases made by the Company prior to these periods.  
   
  7. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
  Derivative instruments         The Company's primary market exposures are to interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses certain derivative financial instruments to help manage these exposures. The Company executes these instruments with financial institutions it judges to be credit-worthy. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
  The Company recognizes all derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company has   no   derivatives that are not accounted for as a hedging instrument. 
  Cash flow hedges         The Company entered into a cash flow hedge which is an interest rape swap associated with a new long-term note issued during the second quarter of 2016 that will terminate with long-term note in May 2023. The Company previously had a cash flow hedge which was an interest rate swap associated with a U.S. long-term note which matured in June 2015. The fair value amounts in the consolidated balance sheet related to the interest rate swaps were:

     Table of Contents

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) 
  (In thousands, except share and per share data) 

(1)  Notional amounts represent the gross contract/notional amount of the derivatives outstanding. 
     
  The derivative gains and losses in the consolidated statements of income related to the Company's interest rate swap contracts was as follows: 

8. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
  The Company's financial instruments consist of cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, auction rate securities, accounts payable, drawings on revolving lines of credit, long-term debt, contingent purchase consideration and interest rate swaps. 
  The valuation techniques used to measure fair value are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect internal market assumptions. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. 
  The carrying amounts of cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, drawings on revolving lines of credit, the long-term notes and interest rate swaps are considered reasonable estimates of their fair market value, due to the short maturity of most of these instruments or as a result of the competitive market interest rates, which have been negotiated.  
  The following table presents information about the Company's assets and liabilities measured at fair value: 
  
   9 

     Table of Contents  
  IPG PHOTONICS CORPORATION 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) 
  (In thousands, except share and per share data) 

Short-term investments are recorded at book value. Unrealized gains or losses are not recorded since these investments are considered held-to-maturity and consist of liquid investments including U.S. government and government agency notes, corporate notes, commercial paper and certificates of deposit with original maturities of greater than three months but less than one year. The fair value of these investments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $126,860   and   $106,375  , respectively, which represents an unrealized loss of   $110   and   $209  , respectively, as compared to the book value recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the same periods. 
  The fair value of the auction rate securities considered prices observed in inactive secondary markets for the securities held by the Company.  
  The fair value of accrued contingent purchase consideration incurred was determined using an income approach at the acquisition date and reporting date. That approach is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market. Key assumptions include assessing the probability of meeting certain milestones required to earn the contingent purchase consideration.

9. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES 
  The following table sets forth the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  : 

Intangible assets, subject to amortization, consisted of the following: 

During the second quarter of 2016, the Company acquired Menara Networks, Inc. ("Menara"). Menara is located in Dallas, Texas. The Company paid   $46,831   which represents the fair value of Menara on that date. As a result of the acquisition, the Company recorded intangible assets of   $19,300   related to technology, tradename and customer relationships. Additionally, the Company recorded   $19,638   of goodwill related to anticipated expansion of the Company's product offerings within the telecom market. The goodwill arising from this acquisition will not be deductible for tax purposes.  
    
  The purchase price allocations included in the Company's financial statements are not complete. They represent the 
  preliminary fair value estimates as of   September 30, 2016   and are subject to subsequent adjustment as the Company obtains 
  additional information during the measurement period and finalizes its fair value estimates. Any subsequent adjustments to 
  these fair value estimates occurring during the measurement period will result in an adjustment to goodwill or income, as 
  applicable. 
  Amortization expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $1,252   and   $585  , respectively. Amortization expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $2,696   and   $1,706  , respectively. The estimated future amortization expense for intangibles for the remainder of   2016   and subsequent years is as follows:

10. PRODUCT WARRANTIES 
  The Company typically provides   one   to   three  -year parts and service warranties on lasers and amplifiers. Most of the Company's sales offices provide support to customers in their respective geographic areas. Warranty reserves have generally been sufficient to cover product warranty repair and replacement costs. The following table summarizes product warranty activity recorded during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

Accrued warranty reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   consisted of   $14,686   and   $14,871   in accrued expenses and other liabilities and   $17,992   and   $13,339   in other long-term liabilities, respectively. 
   
  11. INCOME TAXES 
  A reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: 

Substantially all of the liability for uncertain tax benefits related to various federal, state and foreign income tax matters, would benefit the Company's effective tax rate, if recognized.  
   
  12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  From time to time, the Company may be involved in disputes and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of its business. 
  These proceedings may include allegations of infringement of intellectual property, commercial disputes and employment 
  matters. As of   September 30, 2016   and through the filing date of these Financial Statements, the Company has no legal proceedings ongoing that management estimates could have a material effect on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
  You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements. See "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." 
   
  Overview 
  We develop and manufacture a broad line of high-performance fiber lasers, fiber amplifiers and diode lasers that are used in numerous applications, primarily in materials processing. We sell our products globally to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), system integrators and end users. We market our products internationally primarily through our direct sales force. 
  We are vertically integrated such that we design and manufacture most of our key components used in our finished products, from semiconductor diodes to optical fiber preforms, finished fiber lasers and amplifiers. We also manufacture certain complementary products used with our lasers, including optical delivery cables, fiber couplers, beam switches, optical processing heads and chillers. In addition, we offer laser-based systems for certain markets and applications. 
   
  Factors and Trends That Affect Our Operations and Financial Results  
  In reading our financial statements, you should be aware of the following factors and trends that our management believes are important in understanding our financial performance. 
  Net sales.   We derive net sales primarily from the sale of fiber lasers and amplifiers. We also sell diode lasers, communications systems, laser systems and complementary products. We sell our products through our direct sales organization and our network of distributors and sales representatives, as well as system integrators. We sell our products to OEMs that supply materials processing laser systems, communications systems, medical laser systems and other laser systems for advanced applications to end users. We also sell our products to end users that build their own systems which incorporate our products or use our products as an energy or light source. Our scientists and engineers work closely with OEMs, systems integrators and end users to analyze their system requirements and match appropriate fiber laser or amplifier specifications. Our sales cycle varies substantially, ranging from a period of a few weeks to as long as one year or more, but is typically several months. 
  Sales of our products generally are recognized upon shipment, provided that no obligations remain and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured. Our sales typically are made on a purchase order basis rather than through long-term purchase commitments. 
  We develop our products to standard specifications and use a common set of components within our product architectures. Our major products are based upon a common technology platform. We continually enhance these and other products by improving their components and developing new components and new product designs. 
  The average selling prices of our products generally decrease as the products mature. These decreases result from factors such as decreased manufacturing costs and increases in unit volumes, increased competition, the introduction of new products and market share considerations. In the past, we have lowered our selling prices in order to penetrate new markets and applications. Furthermore, we may negotiate discounted selling prices from time to time with certain customers that purchase multiple units. 
  Gross margin  . Our total gross margin in any period can be significantly affected by total net sales in any period, by product mix, that is, the percentage of our revenue in the period that is attributable to higher or lower-power products and the mix of sales between laser and amplifier sources and complete systems, by sales mix between OEM customers who purchase devices from us in high unit volumes and other customers, by mix of sales in different geographies and by other factors, some of which are not under our control. 
  Our product mix affects our margins because the selling price per watt is generally higher for mid-power devices and certain specialty products than for high-power devices and certain pulsed lasers sold in large volumes. The overall cost of high-power lasers may be partially offset by improved absorption of fixed overhead costs associated with sales of larger volumes of higher-power products because they use a greater number of optical components and drive economies of scale in manufacturing. Also, the profit margins on systems can be lower than margins for our laser and amplifier sources, depending on the configuration, volume and competitive forces, among other factors. 
  
   13 

     Table of Contents  

The mix of sales between OEM customers and other customers can affect gross margin because we provide sales price discounts on products based on the number of units ordered. As the number of OEM customers increases and the number of units ordered increases, the average sales price per unit will be reduced. We expect that the impact of reduced sales price per unit will be offset by the manufacturing efficiency provided by high unit volume orders, but the timing and extent of achieving these efficiencies may not always match the mix of sales in any given time period or be realized at all. 
  We also regularly review our inventory for items that are slow-moving, have been rendered obsolete or determined to be excess. Any write-off of such slow-moving, obsolete or excess inventory affects our gross margins. For example, we recorded provisions for inventory totaling   $6.5 million   and   $4.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and $15.4 million, $11.3 million and $15.1 million for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. 
  Sales and marketing expense.   We expect to continue to expand our worldwide direct sales organization, build and expand applications centers, hire additional sales and marketing personnel at our existing and new geographic locations as wells as to support sales of new product lines, increase the number of units for demonstration purposes and otherwise increase expenditures on sales and marketing activities in order to support the growth in our net sales. As such, we expect that our sales and marketing expenses will increase in the aggregate. 
  Research and development expense.   We plan to continue to invest in research and development to improve our existing components and products and develop new components, products, systems and applications technology. The amount of research and development expense we incur may vary from period to period. In general, if net sales continue to increase we expect research and development expense to increase in the aggregate. 
  General and administrative expense.   We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to invest in systems and resources in management, finance, legal, information technology, human resources and administration to support our worldwide operations. Legal expenses vary from quarter to quarter based primarily upon the level of litigation and transaction activities. 
  Foreign Exchange.   Because we are a U.S. based company doing business globally, we have both translational and transactional exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in the relative exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the foreign currencies in which our subsidiaries operate directly affects our sales, costs and earnings. Differences in the relative exchange rates between where we sell our products and where we incur manufacturing and other operating costs (primarily in the U.S., Germany and Russia) also affects our costs, and earnings. Certain currencies experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations like the Euro, the Russian Ruble, the Japanese Yen and Chinese Yuan have had and could have an additional significant impact on our sales, costs and earnings. Our ability to adjust the foreign currency selling prices of products in response to changes in exchange rates is limited and may not offset the impact of the changes in exchange rates on the translated value of sales or costs. In addition, if we increase the selling price of our products in local currencies this could have a negative impact on the demand for our products. 
  Major customers.   While we have historically depended on a few customers for a large percentage of our annual net sales, the composition of this group can change from year to year. Net sales derived from our five largest customers as a percentage of our net sales was   21%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 25%, 23% and 21% for the full years   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. None of our customers accounted for more than 10% of our net sales for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Our largest customer accounted for 13% of our net sales for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . We seek to add new customers and to expand our relationships with existing customers. We anticipate that the composition of our significant customers will continue to change. If any of our significant customers substantially reduced their purchases from us, our results would be adversely affected. 
   
  Results of Operations for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015 
  Net sales.   Net sales increased by   $22.5   million, or   9.2%  , to   $266.0 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $243.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .

Sales for materials processing applications increased due to higher sales of high-power lasers and low-power lasers. 
             
    High-power laser sales increased due to higher demand for cutting, welding and additive manufacturing applications. High-power lasers are continuing to displace CO2 lasers in cutting systems sold by our OEM customers. In addition, OEM's for additive manufacturing equipment are increasing the use of high power lasers instead of medium power lasers. Our additive manufacturing OEM customers are producing systems using lasers with higher output powers in order to improve the speed with which parts are grown.  
                
    Medium-power sales decreased due to a decrease in demand for fine cutting and lasers used in sintering/additive manufacturing partially offset by a higher demand for welding applications. The decline in medium-power lasers used for additive manufacturing is due to timing of orders as well as increased use of high-power lasers for this application. 
                
    Low-power laser sales increased due to higher sales for medical applications.  
                
    Pulsed laser sales decreased due to lower sales of low-power pulsed lasers partially offset by an increase in high-power pulsed lasers sales and an increase in green pulsed lasers sales. High-power pulsed sales are driven by ablation and cleaning applications as well as marking and engraving applications. The increase in green pulsed lasers is driven by edge deletion in solar cell manufacturing. 
                
    QCW laser sales decreased due to lower demand from consumer electronics applications.  
                
    Other revenue increased due to higher telecom sales, an increase in parts and service revenue and lower deferred revenue.  
     Sales for other applications decreased slightly due to lower sales for advanced applications offset by greater telecom applications sales. The increase in telecom sales was driven by sales from Menara Networks, Inc ("Menara") which we acquired in the second quarter of 2016.  
  Cost of sales and gross margin.   Cost of sales increased by   $11.0 million  , or   10.0%  , to   $121.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $110.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Our gross margin   decreased   slightly to   54.4%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   54.7%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Gross margin   decreased   due to lower average selling prices, a decrease in absorption of manufacturing costs in the quarter, an increase in the provision for inventory reserves and also due to an increase in expenses related to the amortization of intangibles and the step-up to fair value of inventory acquired in the Menara transaction. These impacts were partially offset by a reduction in the cost of internally manufactured components, increased manufacturing efficiency and product mix which included increased sales of high-power and pulsed lasers with higher average power.  
  Sales and marketing expense.   Sales and marketing expense   increased   by   $2.8 million  , or   35.5%  , to   $10.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $7.7 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of an increase in expenses related to personnel, commissions, trade fairs and exhibitions, depreciation and premises. As a

percentage of sales, sales and marketing expense increased to   3.9%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   3.2%   for   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Research and development expense.   Research and development expense   increased   by   $4.3 million  , or   26.6%  , to   $20.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $16.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of an increase in expenses related to personnel, stock-based compensation, materials used for research and development projects and depreciation which were partially offset by a decrease in expenses related to outside contractors. Research and development continues to focus on developing new products, enhancing performance of existing components, improving production processes and developing manufacturing of new components. New products include lasers that operate at different wavelengths such as ultra-violet, visible and mid-infrared, lasers with ultra-fast pulses, laser based systems for material processing, projection, display and medical as well as accessories such as welding and cutting heads. We enhance the performance of existing products and components by increasing electrical efficiency and output power. We improve manufacturing processes by increasing yields and productivity. In addition we are developing manufacturing capability for new components such as crystals to support both current and new products. As a percentage of sales, research and development expense   increased   to   7.7%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   6.7%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  General and administrative expense.   General and administrative expense   increased   by   $2.1 million  , or   14.4%  , to   $16.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $14.7 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . This was primarily as a result of increased personnel expense, stock-based compensation, accounting, legal and information technology costs partially offset by decreases in premises expense. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expense was   6.3%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   6.0%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Effect of exchange rates on net sales, gross profit and operating expenses.   We estimate that, if exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar had been the same as one year ago, which were on average Euro   0.90  , Russian Ruble   63  , Japanese Yen   122   and Chinese Yuan   6.28  , respectively, we would have expected net sales to be   $2.0 million   higher, gross profit to be   $1.1 million   higher and total operating expenses would have been   $0.1 million   higher. 
  Loss (gain) on foreign exchange.   We incurred a foreign exchange   loss   of   $2.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to a   $5.1 million     loss   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Foreign exchange losses for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   were primarily attributable to the appreciation of the Euro and Russian Ruble as compared to the U.S. Dollar and the depreciation of the Chinese Yuan as compared to the U.S. Dollar. Foreign exchange losses for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   were primarily attributable to the depreciation of the Chinese Yuan compared to the U.S. dollar which was partially offset by the depreciation of the Russian Ruble compared to the U.S. dollar and appreciation of the Japanese Yen compared to the Euro. 
  Interest income (expense), net.   Interest income (expense), increased to   $0.4 million   of income for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $0.0 million   of expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   as a result of higher yielding interest on investments.  
  Other income, net.   Other income, remained relatively flat for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  
  Provision for income taxes.   Provision for income taxes was   $25.4 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $26.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The effective tax rates were   26.9%   and   30.0%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The   decrease   in the effective rate was primarily due to the release of income tax reserves upon the completion of a tax audit as well as an increase in the benefit related to research and development tax credits. The legislation enabling research and development credits in the United States was permanently re-enacted at the end of 2015. As it was not permanently re-enacted until the end of the year, there was no benefit related to research and development credits for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  
  Net income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation.   Net income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation   increased   by   $6.4 million   to   $69.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $62.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Net income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation as a percentage of our net sales   increased   by   0.2   percentage points to   26.0%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   25.8%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   due to the factors described above. 
   
  Results of Operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015    
  Net sales.   Net sales increased by   $48.4 million  , or   7.1%  , to   $726.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $677.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .

Sales for materials processing applications increased due to higher sales of high-power lasers, pulsed lasers and laser systems.  
             
    High-power laser sales increased due to higher demand for cutting, cladding, laser sintering and heating and annealing applications partially offset by a decline in automotive related welding applications and decreases in average selling prices. High-power lasers are continuing to displace CO2 lasers in cutting systems sold by our OEM customers. We are also seeing increased use of high-power lasers for deposition applications like cladding and laser sintering which is used in additive manufacturing. Our additive manufacturing OEM customers are producing systems using lasers with higher output powers in order to improve the speed with which parts are grown. The increase in heat treatment and annealing applications was due to a large order from one customer. 
                
    Medium-power sales decreased due to a decrease in demand for fine cutting and lasers used in sintering/additive manufacturing partially offset by a higher demand for welding applications. As discussed above, our additive manufacturing OEM customers are increasingly using high-power lasers instead of medium-power lasers in their systems.  
                
       Low-power laser sales decreased due to lower sales for medical applications.  
                
    Pulsed laser sales increased due to higher demand for marking and engraving applications. Marking and engraving applications are increasing due to increased demand in consumer electronics and packaging and due to increased performance offered by our high-power pulsed products.  
                
    QCW laser sales decreased due to lower demand from consumer electronics applications.  
                
    The increase in laser system sales contributed to the increase in other revenue detailed above. Increased sales in laser systems are due to increased demand for customized laser system solutions as a result of the investments we have made to develop laser systems for various applications and in the sales and distribution network to support this product line.  
     Sales for other applications increased due to higher sales for advanced applications and telecom applications. The increase in sales for advanced applications was driven by government and aerospace applications and contributed to increased high-power laser sales and sales of certain components included in other revenue detailed above. The increase in telecom sales was driven by sales from Menara, which we acquired in the second quarter of 2016, and an increase in amplifier sales used for last mile fiber access to the home applications. These sales increases were partially offset by a decrease in medical application sales.

Cost of sales and gross margin.   Cost of sales   increased   by   $21.3 million  , or   6.9%  , to   $329.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $307.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Our gross margin   increased   slightly to   54.7%   from   54.6%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Gross margin   increased   due to decreases in the cost of internally manufactured components and increased manufacturing efficiency which have offset decreases in average selling prices. Gross margin also benefited from product mix including increased sales of high-power and pulsed lasers with higher output power. These benefits were partially offset by a decrease in absorption of manufacturing costs, increased provision for inventory reserves and also due to an increase in expenses related to the amortization of intangibles and the step-up to fair value of inventory acquired in the Menara transaction.. 
  Sales and marketing expense.   Sales and marketing expense   increased   by   $5.0 million  , or   21.3%  , to   $28.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $23.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of increased expenses for personnel, commissions, trade show and exhibitions and premises. As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing expense increased to   3.9%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   3.4%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Research and development expense.   Research and development expense   increased   by   $10.8 million  , or   23.9%  , to   $56.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $45.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of an increase in personnel expense, stock-based compensation, premises, travel, depreciation and materials used for research and development. These increases were partially offset by decreased expenses related to outside research and development contracts. Research and development continues to focus on developing new products, enhancing performance of existing components, improving production processes and developing manufacturing of new components. New products include lasers that operate at different wavelengths such as ultra-violet, visible and mid-infrared, lasers with ultra-fast pulses, , laser based systems for material processing, projection, display and medical as well as accessories such as welding and cutting heads. In addition to new products research and development is focused on enhancing the performance of our existing products by improving their electrical efficiency and increasing their average power. Other research and development activities include enhancing and reducing the cost of our internally manufactured components, developing new components such as crystals and refining production processes to improve manufacturing yields and productivity.As a percentage of sales, research and development expense   increased   to   7.8%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   6.7%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  General and administrative expense.   General and administrative expense   increased   by   $4.3 million  , or   10.3%  , to   $46.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $42.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of increased expenses for personnel, stock-based compensation, fees and subscriptions, information technology , insurance, travel, legal and consulting, partially offset by lower bad debt provisions and lower expenses for premises and depreciation. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expense   increased   to   6.5%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   6.3%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Effect of exchange rates on net sales, gross profit and operating expenses.   We estimate that, if exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar had been the same as one year ago, which were on average Euro   0.90  , Russian Ruble   60  , Japanese Yen   121   and Chinese Yuan   6.19  , respectively, we would have expected net sales for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   to be   $10.6 million   higher, gross profit to be   $5.0 million   higher and total operating expenses would have been   $2.2 million   higher. 
  Loss (gain) on foreign exchange.   We incurred a foreign exchange loss of   $6.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to a   $0.5 million   gain for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The loss for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily attributable to appreciation of the Russian Ruble as compared to the U.S. Dollar and depreciation of the Chinese Yuan as compared to the U.S. Dollar. The gain for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   was primarily attributable to depreciation of the Euro and Russian Ruble as compared to the U.S. Dollar which was partially offset by the depreciation of the Chinese Yuan as compared to the U.S. Dollar. 
  Interest income (expense), net.   Interest income (expense), increased to   $0.8 million   of income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $0.3 million   of expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   as a result of higher yielding interest on investments.  
  Other income, net.   Other income, net decreased to   $0.3 million   of   income   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to approximately   $0.4 million   of income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  
  Provision for income taxes.   Provision for income taxes was   $74.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $77.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , representing an effective tax rate of   28.7%   and   30.0%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The   decrease   in the effective rate was primarily due to the the release of income tax reserves upon the completion of a tax audit, the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions, and an increase in the benefit related toresearch and development tax credits. The legislation enabling research

and development credits in the United States was permanently enacted at the end of 2015. As it was not permanently re-enacted until the end of the year, there was no benefit related to research and development credits for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  
  Net income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation.   Net income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation increased by   $4.2 million   to   $185.6 million  , or   2.3%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $181.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Net income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation as a percentage of our net sales   decreased   by   1.2   percentage points to   25.6%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   26.8%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   due to the factors described above. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our principal sources of liquidity as of   September 30, 2016   consisted of cash and cash equivalents of   $645.6   million, short-term investments of   $127.0 million  , unused credit lines and overdraft facilities of   $77.7 million   and other working capital (excluding cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments) of   $348.3   million. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of   $582.5   million, short-term investments of   $106.6 million  , unused credit lines and overdraft facilities of   $73.9 million   and other working capital (excluding cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments) of   $288.8   million as of   December 31, 2015  . The increase in cash and cash equivalents of   $63.0   million relates primarily to cash provided by operating activities in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   of   $193.0   million, cash provided by financing activities of   $29.6 million   and effect of exchange rates on cash of   $7.4 million   which was partially offset by cash used in investing activities of   $166.9 million   which was primarily related to capital expenditures, the acquisition of Menara Networks and an increase in short-term investments. 
  Short-term investments consist of liquid investments including U.S. government and government agency notes, corporate 
  notes, commercial paper and certificates of deposit with original maturities of greater than three months but less than one year. 
  Our long-term debt consists of two long-term notes totaling   $41.6 million   of which   $3.2 million   is the current portion. We have an unsecured note with an outstanding balance at   September 30, 2016   of   $23.5 million   of which   $1.2 million   is the current portion. The interest on this unsecured note is variable at 1.20% above the LIBOR rate and is fixed using an interest rate swap at 2.85% per annum. The unsecured note matures in May 2023, at which time the outstanding debt balance will be $15.4 million. The Company has another note that is secured by the Company's corporate aircraft. The outstanding balance on this secured note at   September 30, 2016   was   $18.2 million   of which   $2.0 million   is the current portion. The interest rate on this secured note is fixed at 2.81% per annum and it matures in October 2019, at which time the outstanding debt balance will be $12.0 million.  
  We believe that our existing cash and marketable securities, our cash flows from operations and our existing lines of credit provides us with the financial flexibility to meet our liquidity and capital needs and to complete potential acquisitions of businesses and technologies. Our future long-term capital requirements will depend on many factors including our level of sales, the impact of economic environment on our sales levels, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of the global sales and marketing activities, government regulation including trade sanctions, the timing and introductions of new products, the need to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity and the continuing market acceptance of our products. 
  The following table details our line-of-credit facilities as of   September 30, 2016  :

     Table of Contents  

(1) 
    This facility is available to certain foreign subsidiaries in their respective local currencies. At   September 30, 2016  , there were no drawings however, there were   $0.2 million   of guarantees issued against the facility which reduces the amount of the facility available to draw.  
              (2) 
    This facility is also available to certain foreign subsidiaries in their respective local currencies. At   September 30, 2016  , there were no drawings however, there were   $8.0 million   of guarantees issued against the facility which reduces the amount of the facility available to draw.  
      Our largest committed credit lines are with Bank of America N.A. and Deutsche Bank AG in the amounts of $50.0 million and   $33.6 million   (or 30 million Euro as described above), respectively, and neither of them is syndicated.  
  We are required to meet certain financial covenants associated with our U.S. revolving line of credit and long-term debt facility. These covenants, tested quarterly, include a debt service coverage ratio and a funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") ratio. The debt service coverage covenant requires that we maintain a trailing twelve month ratio of cash flow to debt service that is at least 1.5:1. Debt service is defined as required principal and interest payments during the period. Debt service in the calculation is decreased by our cash held in the U.S.A. in excess of $50 million up to a maximum of $250 million. Cash flow is defined as EBITDA less unfunded capital expenditures. The funded debt to EBITDA covenant requires that the sum of all indebtedness for borrowed money on a consolidated basis be less than three times our trailing twelve months EBITDA. We were in compliance with all such financial covenants as of and for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
  Operating activities.   Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by   $1.6 million   to   $193.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $194.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Net cash provided by operating activities is generally driven by cash provided by net income after adding back non-cash charges offset by continued growth in working capital to support the growth of the business. Our largest working capital items are inventory and accounts receivable. Items such as accounts payable to third parties, prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities are not as significant as our working capital investment in accounts receivable and inventory. The relatively high level of investment in inventory is primarily attributable to the amount of value that is added internally which is primarily due to our vertically integrated manufacturing. Accruals and payables for personnel costs including bonuses and income and other taxes payable are largely dependent on the timing of payments for those items. The decrease in cash flow from operating activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   primarily resulted from: 
             
    An increase in cash provided by net income after adding back non-cash charges of   $22.2 million   to   $267.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to   $244.9 million   for the same period in   2015   mainly resulting from an increase in depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation which was partially offset by a decrease in net income and changes in deferred income taxes between the two periods; 
                  
    The benefits to cash flow from operating activities described above were offset by a decrease in income taxes payable of   $7.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to an increase in income taxes payable of   $17.5 million   for the same period in   2015  . The decrease in income taxes payable was primarily attributable to an increase in cash taxes paid in Germany as a result of an increase in estimated tax payments due for the year ended December 31, 2015 and estimated tax payments for the current year. The estimated tax payments were increased after we filed our 2014 German tax return. 
     Given our vertical integration, rigorous and time-consuming testing procedures for both internally manufactured and externally purchased components and the lead time required to manufacture components used in our finished products, the rate at which we turn inventory has historically been comparatively low when compared to our cost of sales. Also, our historic growth rates required investment in inventories to support future sales and enable us to quote short delivery times to our customers, providing what we believe is a competitive advantage. Furthermore, if there was a disruption to the manufacturing capacity of any of our key technologies, our inventories of components should enable us to continue to build finished products for a reasonable period of time. We believe that we will continue to maintain a relatively high level of inventory compared to our cost of sales. As a result, we expect to have a significant amount of working capital invested in inventory. A reduction in our level of net sales or the rate of growth of our net sales from their current levels would mean that the rate at which we are able to convert our inventory into cash would decrease.

Investing activities.   Net cash used in investing activities was   $166.9 million   and   $55.4 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The cash used in investing activities in   2016   related to   $100.0 million   for the construction of new buildings in the United States, Germany and Russia, purchases of machinery and equipment and the purchase of a building in Marlborough, MA. Additionally, cash used for investing activities in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   included   $46.5 million   for the purchase of Menara Networks, net of cash acquired and   $20.6 million   of net purchases of short-term investments. The cash used in investing activities in   2015   related to   $50.8 million   for the construction and purchase of new buildings in the United States, Germany and Russia, purchases of machinery and equipment and   $5.0 million   for the the purchase of a majority interest in a company.  
  We expect to incur between   $110 million   and   $125 million   in capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, in   2016  , as we continue to upgrade facilities and equipment to add capacity worldwide to support anticipated revenue growth. The timing and extent of any capital expenditures in and between periods can have a significant effect on our cash flow. Many of the capital expenditure projects that we undertake have long lead times and are difficult to cancel or defer to a later period. 
  Financing activities.   Net cash provided by financing activities was   $29.6 million   and   $1.2 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The cash provided by financing activities in   2016   was primarily related to proceeds of   $23.8 million   from financing related to the purchase of a building in Marlborough, MA, as well as cash provided by the exercise of stock options, sales of shares under our employee stock purchase plan and the related tax benefits of the exercises partially offset by the purchase of treasury stock of   $3.5 million   and payments on our long-term borrowings and net payments of line-of-credit facilities. The cash provided by financing activities in   2015   was primarily related to the cash provided by the exercise of stock options, sales of shares under our employee stock purchase plan and the related tax benefits of the exercises partially offset by the payments on our long-term borrowings and net payments of line-of-credit facilities.

  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting" ("ASU 2016-09"). The standard is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including income tax impact, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. The impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements will depend upon certain criteria including the timing of the exercise and release of equity instruments, the value realized upon exercise or release of equity instruments and the fair value of the equity instruments when they were granted. The excess tax benefit from the exercise of equity instruments was   $2.8 million   and   $5.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)" ("ASU 2016-02"). The standard requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with lease terms greater than 12 months. ASU 2016-02  
  
   21 

     Table of Contents  

is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have and do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, "Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" ("ASU 2016-01"). The standard addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have and do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued amended guidance that clarifies that in a classified statement of financial position, an entity shall classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as non-current amounts. The new guidance supersedes ASC 740-10-45-5 which required the deferred tax assets and liabilities for a particular tax jurisdiction be allocated between current and non-current deferred tax assets for that tax jurisdiction on a pro rata basis. The new standard will become effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2017. We have determined that the standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption. Current deferred tax assets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were   $24.6 million   and   $20.3 million  , respectively. Current deferred tax liabilities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were   $4.0 million   and   $3.2 million  , respectively. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 ("ASU 2014-09") "Revenue from Contracts with Customers." ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in "Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)", and requires entities to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the 
  consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. As currently issued and 
  amended, ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods 
  within that reporting period, though early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements and do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 
   
  ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    
  We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of business, which consists primarily of interest rate risk associated with our cash and cash equivalents and our debt and foreign exchange rate risk. 
  Interest rate risk  . Our investments have limited exposure to market risk. We maintain a portfolio of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, consisting primarily of bank deposits, money market funds, certificates of deposit, corporate notes and government and agency securities. None of these investments have a maturity date in excess of one year. The interest rates are variable and fluctuate with current market conditions. Because of the short-term nature of these instruments, a sudden change in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 
  We are also exposed to market risk as a result of increases or decreases in the amount of interest expense we must pay on our bank debt and borrowings on our bank credit facilities. Our interest obligations on our long-term debt are fixed either by the underlying agreement or by means of an interest rate swap agreement. Although our U.S. revolving line of credit and our Euro credit facility have variable rates, we do not believe that a 10% change in market interest rates would have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 
  Exchange rates.   Due to our international operations, a significant portion of our net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, principally the Euro, the Russian Ruble, the Chinese Yuan and the Japanese Yen. As a result, our international operations give rise to transactional market risk associated with exchange rate movements of the U.S. Dollar, the Euro, the Russian Ruble, the Chinese Yuan and the Japanese Yen. Gain on foreign exchange transactions totaled   $2.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and a loss of   $5.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Management attempts to minimize these exposures by partially or fully off-setting foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities at our subsidiaries that operate in different functional currencies. The effectiveness of this strategy can be limited by the volume of underlying transactions at various subsidiaries and by our ability to accelerate or delay inter-company cash settlements. As a result, we are unable to create a perfect offset of the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. Furthermore, if we expect a currency movement to be beneficial to us in the short or medium term, we have, on occasions, chosen not to hedge or otherwise off-set the underlying assets or liabilities. However, it is difficult to predict foreign currency movements accurately. At   September 30, 2016  , our material foreign currency exposure is net U.S. Dollar denominated assets at subsidiaries where the Euro or the Russian Ruble is the functional currency and U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities where the Chinese Yuan is the functional currency. The net U.S. Dollar denominated assets are  
  
   22 

     Table of Contents  

comprised of cash, third party receivables, inter-company receivables and inter-company notes offset by third party and inter-company U.S. Dollar denominated payables. The U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities are comprised of inter-company payables. A 5% change in the relative exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar to the Euro as of   September 30, 2016   applied to the net U.S. Dollar asset balances, would result in a foreign exchange gain of $5.8 million if the U.S. Dollar appreciated and a $5.8 million foreign exchange loss if the U.S. Dollar depreciated. 
  In addition we are exposed to foreign currency translation risk for those subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar as changes in the value of their functional currency relative to the U.S. Dollar can adversely affect the translated amounts of our revenue, expenses, net income, assets and liabilities. This can, in turn, affect the reported value and relative growth of sales and net income from one period to the next. In addition changes in the translated value of assets and liabilities due to changes in functional currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar result in  foreign currency translation adjustments that are a component of other comprehensive income or loss. 
  Foreign currency derivative instruments can also be used to hedge exposures and reduce the risks of certain foreign currency transactions; however, these instruments provide only limited protection and can carry significant cost. We have no foreign currency derivative instrument hedges as of   September 30, 2016  . We will continue to analyze our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations and may engage in financial hedging techniques in the future to attempt to minimize the effect of these potential fluctuations. Exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our financial results in the future.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Under the supervision of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, our management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the "Evaluation Date"). Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
  Changes in Internal Controls 
  There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
  From time to time, we are party to various legal proceedings and other disputes incidental to our business. There have been no material developments to those proceedings reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , except that we have settled the lawsuit filed against us in November 2015 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas for alleged patent infringement. 
   
  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
    
  In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.  
   
  ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
  Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 

(1) 
    In 2012, the Board of Directors approved "withhold to cover" as a tax payment method for vesting of restricted stock awards for certain employees. Pursuant to the "withhold to cover" method, we withheld from such employees the shares noted in the table above to cover tax withholding related to the vesting of their awards. For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , 1,905 shares were withheld at an average price of $83.55 and for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company withheld 5,088 shares at an average price of $85.58.  
       
           (2) 
    On July 28, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (the  Program ). Under the Program, the Company's management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees and directors under its various employee and director equity compensation and employee stock purchase plans from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017. The Program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than   $100   million over a period ending June 30, 2018. For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased   41,800   shares of its common stock with an average price of   $83.33   per share in the open market.

    Definitions 
     In this Credit Facility Agreement the following words and terms are defined as specified below: 
   Banking Day    means a day (other than a Saturday or Sunday) on which banks are open for general business in Cologne. 
   EONIA    means the   E  uro   O  ver  N  ight   I  ndex   A  verage as determined by the European Central Bank for each Target-day. On days which are not a TARGET-day the EONIA as determined on the immediately preceding TARGET-day shall apply. If no EONIA is available on a Target-day the Bank will determine the applicable reference interest rate in accordance with section 315 German Civil Code (  BGB  ) on the basis of the quotations for overnight funds in the European interbank market. 
    
   EURIBOR    means the interest rate per annum for deposits in Euro for the relevant interest period displayed on page 248 of the Telerate screen or a respective succeeding screen replacing page 248 for 11.00 a.m.  

Brussels time two TARGET-days prior to the disbursement/the commencement of the respective interest period. If the EURIBOR cannot be determined two TARGET-days prior to the first interest period, the Bank and the Borrower will negotiate the interest rate for the relevant interest period. The Bank is not obligated to disburse the loan unless an agreement about the applicable interest rate has been reached. The Bank is released from its obligation to disburse the loan if an agreement about the applicable interest rate is not reached within 15 days. If the EURIBOR for an interest period following the first interest period cannot be determined two TARGET-days prior to the commencement of the relevant interest period the Bank will determine interest for the relevant interest period based on interest rates customary in the European interbank market for the particular interest period plus the agreed margin. 
  "  Financial Indebtedness  " means any indebtedness for or in respect of (i) moneys borrowed, (ii) any letters of credit issued and acceptances accepted or issued, which had been discounted, (iii) any amount raised pursuant to any note purchase facility or the issue of bonds, notes, debentures, loan stock or any similar instrument, (iv) lease contracts which would, in accordance with orders or statements of practice of the Federal Ministry of Finance or GAAP under the applicable law as the case may be, be treated as a finance or operating lease, (v) receivables sold or discounted (other than any receivables to the extent they are sold on a non-recourse basis), (vi) any amount raised under any other transaction (including any forward sale or purchase agreement) having the commercial effect of a borrowing, (vii) any derivative transaction entered into in connection with protection against or benefit from fluctuation in any rate or price (and, when calculating the value of any derivative transaction, only the marked to market value shall be taken into account), (viii) any counter-indemnity obligation in respect of a guarantee, indemnity, bond, standby or documentary letter of credit or any other instrument issued by third parties unless both obligations are reported, the primary obligation on and the obligation of the counter-indemnity on or below, the same balance sheet; and (ix) the amount of any liability in respect of any guarantee or indemnity for any of the items referred to in paragraphs (i) through (viii) above, (x) a guarantee, surety or other obligation for any of the obligations listed in paragraphs (i) through (ix), and (xi) provisions for pension obligations. 
       TARGET-day    is any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer System is open for the settlement of payments in Euro. 

All other terms and conditions of the   Credit Facility Agreement   remain unaffected by this amendment. 
  Any Amendment to the   Credit Facility Agreement   is required to be made in writing.
