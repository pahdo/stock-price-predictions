Note 1            Basis of Presentation, Organization, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Incoming, Inc., a Nevada corporation, have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") for interim financial information and, therefore, do not include all disclosures normally required by generally accounting principles accepted in the United States of America. These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's most recent annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 12, 2016. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation have been included in the accompanying financial statements and consist of only normal recurring adjustments. The results of operations presented in the accompanying financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2016.

Organization 

Incoming, Inc. ("we" or the "Company") was incorporated on December 22, 2006 in Nevada.  Through our wholly-owned subsidiary North American Bio-Energies LLC ("NABE"), we operate in the alternative energy industry in the development and acquisition of commercial grade biodiesel facilities and the distribution and marketing of petroleum and biofuel products. In addition to operating as NABE, our subsidiary also does business as Foothills Bio-Energies, LLC ("Foothills").

Note 2            Going Concern  

These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficiency of $532,739, and had an accumulated deficit of $6,480,766.  Its ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the Company to generate profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due.  The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time. These factors raise substantial doubt that the Company will be able to continue as a going concern.  The Company to date has funded its initial operations through the issuance of capital stock and common stock options, loans from related parties, and revenue generated in the normal course of business. Management plans to continue to provide for its capital needs by the issuance of common stock and related party advances.  These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Company Overview

NABE is a refiner and producer of commercial-grade biodiesel as specified by the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM D6751). Our refining and production facility is located in Lenoir, North Carolina with a nameplate annual capacity of five million gallons.  Our facility produces biodiesel from virgin, agri-based feedstock using commercial specifications. The biodiesel we produce is sold throughout North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia directly or through wholesale distributors.  Currently, we are engaged in producing biodiesel and strategically purchasing biodiesel from other producers to meet commercial requirements.  We also purify and sell glycerin, which is created as a byproduct of the biodiesel production process. Once the facility has accumulated sufficient glycerin to make full loads, it is typically sold to the market.

Our production process starts with purchasing the most cost effective and suitable agri-based feedstock (e.g., soy, canola, sunflower, cotton seed and chicken/pork fat). A sample of every feedstock is tested by our in-house laboratory in order to develop the proper recipe of catalysts for the transesterification process. The glycerin byproduct is then separated from the biodiesel and any excess methanol is recovered. Recovered methanol is either sold or reused in the production process. Glycerin is sold on the open market as either a crude product or as a further-processed tech grade product. While biodiesel is our main product, glycerin is a popular chemical used in pharmaceutical and hygiene applications and serves as an additional source of revenue.

Our facility is capable of producing biodiesel from a wide range of agri-based feedstocks: soy, canola, sunflower, cotton seed and chicken/pork fat.  Biodiesel production costs are highly dependent on the cost of feedstock, and we believe the ability to utilize a variety of feedstocks efficiently and interchangeably is imperative to gaining a competitive advantage in the biodiesel production market.

Results of Operations

The following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the factors that could affect our future financial condition.  This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. All references to dollar amounts in this section are in United States dollars unless expressly stated otherwise.

Revenue and Revenue From Related Parties 

The Company generated revenues of $75,243 during the period July 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016. Revenue generated during the period was due to sales of biodiesel, RINs, and materials recovered during glycerin purification processing. During the period July 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016, our biodiesel sales to third parties totaled approximately $42 and our sales to related parties amounted to $74,585. RINs were transferred to the related party for all such sales transacted during the third quarter of 2016. During the glycerin purification process, acid is added to the crude glycerin. As a result, high fatty acid oil separates from the glycerin and yields high fatty acid oil and recovered methanol.  Sales of the recovered methanol sales were $616 for the period under consideration.

The Company generated revenues of $53,538 during the period July 1, 2015 through September 30, 2015. Revenue generated during the period was due to sales of biodiesel, RINs, de-methylated glycerin, and recovered methanol. During the period July 1, 2015 through September 30, 2015, our biodiesel sales to third parties totaled approximately $117 and our sales to related parties amounted to $34,624. RIN sales accounted for $15,015 in revenue during the third quarter of 2015. For the period under consideration, de-methylated glycerin sales amounted to $3,225 while recovered methanol sales totaled $557.

Comparing the Company's activity for the period July 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016 to the activity for the period July 1, 2015 through September 30, 2015, there was a decrease in cost of revenues of $4,589 as the cost of revenues decreased from $115,371 to $110,782. The period-over-period decrease was due to operating with a leaner production crew at the biodiesel facility in Lenoir, NC. Comparing the current quarter to the same period in the prior year, feedstock material costs remained steady. When allowable, the Company recognizes a reduction in cost of goods sold resulting from filing for blender tax credits. The Company did not file for any blender tax credits during the third quarter of 2016, nor did we file for any blender tax credits during the same period in 2015.

INDEX 

Comparing the Company's activity for the period July 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016 to the activity for the period July 1, 2015 through September 30, 2015, there was an increase in SG A expenses of $8,838 as SG A increased from $37,427 to $46,265.

SG A expenses totaled $87,289 for the period January 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016. During the period under consideration, SG A expenses primarily consisted of costs associated with payroll, office overhead and professional fees.

SG A expenses totaled $436,446 for the period January 1, 2015 through September 30, 2015. During the period under consideration, SG A expenses primarily consisted of $350,000 in consulting expenses associated with stock based compensation.

Comparing the Company's activity for the period January 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016 to the activity for the period January 1, 2015 through September 30, 2015, there was a decrease in SG A expenses of $349,157 as SG A declined from $436,446 to $87,289. The period-over-period decrease was due primarily to the consulting expenses recognized during the first nine months of 2015 that did not occur during the same period in 2016. General overhead remained stable considering the first three quarters of the current year compared with the same period in the prior year.

Other Income (Expense) 

Other Income totaled $558 during the period July 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016. During the third quarter of 2016, this amount was attributable to $34 in funding received from the USDA Biofuel Program and to a rebate from our insurance carrier. Each quarter, the Company submits a Payment Request (Form RD-4288) and supporting documents to the USDA delineating those gallons produced/sold. Along with the documentation, the Company informs the USDA regarding the type and quantity of feedstocks utilized.  These payment requests are reviewed by an agent of the USDA and then submitted as part of the "pool" for funding. Biodiesel producers compete for whatever funding is available from the USDA's pool. Since it is difficult to predict the amount of funding that may be received, the Company only recognizes Other Income associated with the USDA Biofuel Program when the funds are received. The additional $524 of Other Income recognized during the current quarter was related to a refund from our insurance carrier.  Our carrier performed an audit of 2015 and determined that we were eligible for a refund. The refund was recorded in Other Income, instead of an offset to insurance expense, since its basis was an audit of a prior year.

Other income totaled $119 during the period July 1, 2015 through September 30, 2015. During the third quarter of 2015, this amount was attributable to funding received from the USDA Biofuel Program. Each quarter, the Company submits a Payment Request (Form RD-4288) and supporting documents to the USDA delineating those gallons produced/sold. Along with the documentation, the Company informs the USDA regarding the type and quantity of feedstocks utilized.  These payment requests are reviewed by an agent of the USDA and then submitted as part of the "pool" for funding. Biodiesel producers compete for whatever funding is available from the USDA's pool.

INDEX 

Other Income totaled $720 during the period January 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016. During the first nine months of 2016, this amount was attributable to $196 in funding received from the USDA Biofuel Program and from $524 in rebates from our insurance carrier.

Other income totaled $629,997 during the period January 1, 2015 through September 30, 2015. December 31, 2013 marked the expiration of the IRS tax credit of one dollar per blended gallon of biodiesel.  During the first quarter of 2014, NABE sold biodiesel to a customer with the agreement that, in the event the tax credit were to be reinstated, the benefit of the tax credit would be shared equally between the companies.  In late December of 2014, the blender tax credit was reinstated retroactively to January 1, 2014 and was effective through December 31, 2014. The IRS issued guidance for filing for the tax credit during the first quarter of 2015. After the end of the first quarter of 2015, the Company was notified by our customer that they had successfully filed for and received the tax credit funds. NABE has subsequently recognized Other Income and has been paid $510,030 for its half of the blender tax credit dollars. During the period January 1, 2015 through September 30, 2105, Other Income of $119,746 was also recognized on the final insurance settlement from the fire incident experienced August 1, 2014 at the biodiesel plant in Lenoir, NC. Additional Other Income totaling $221 was recognized on funds received which were associated with the USDA Biofuel Program.

Comparing the working capital deficiency at September 30, 2016 to the deficiency at December 31, 2015, there was an increase of $136,259 as the deficiency increased from $ 396,480  to $532,739. The biggest contributor to the overall increase in the deficit was operating in an environment of unfavorable market conditions   lower benchmark petroleum prices while feedstock prices have not reduced commensurately.

On a short-term basis, it is anticipated that the Company's liquidity needs will be met through selling biodiesel related products and RIN-gallons, through borrowing from related parties and through the sale of common stock.  Considering the long-term view, the Company intends to provide liquidity through operation of its biodiesel plant in Lenoir, North Carolina. Since the December 31, 2015 balance sheet date, total receivables have increased $57,233 with no amounts written off.

INDEX 

To date, cash flow requirements have been primarily met through sales of biodiesel related products, through collections of accounts receivable, through share issuances, and through gross proceeds from bank and related party loans. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company generated a gross loss of $106,156 on sales of $146,422 over the same period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company generated a gross loss of $273,025 on sales of $102,762 over the same period.

A portion of the Company's operations have been funded through the issuance of common stock shares. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has issued 33,754,332 shares of common stock (31,774,332 shares of Class A stock and 1,980,000 shares of Class B stock).

To date, our cash flow requirements have been primarily met by equity financings and from operating the Company's biodiesel production facility in Lenoir, NC. Management expects to keep operational costs to a minimum until cash is available through financing or operating activities. Management plans to continue to seek other sources of financing on favorable terms; however, there are no assurances that any such financing can be obtained on favorable terms, if at all. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the Company to generate profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due.  The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time. These factors raise substantial doubt that the Company will be able to continue as a going concern.

Cash Provided By (Used In) Operating Activities

During the period January 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016, the Company's cash used in operating activities totaled $60,804. For the same period, the Company's cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to generating trade receivables associated with biodiesel and RIN sales, and making payments on trade payables. Third party trade receivables decreased $28 and related party receivables decreased $57,205 while inventories decreased $3,253. Trade payables increased $6,601 for the same period. Depreciation expense was $56,990 for the first nine months of 2016.

During the period January 1, 2015 through September 30, 2015, the Company's cash provided by operating activities totaled $278,943. For the same period, the Company's cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to recognizing $350,000 in consulting expense (stock-based compensation), generating trade receivables associated with biodiesel sales, and making payments on trade payables. Third party trade receivables decreased $2,504 and related party receivables increased $34,037 while inventories increased $18,357. Trade payables decreased $22,257 for the same period. Depreciation expense was $74,674 for the first nine months of 2015.

Cash Used In Investing Activities

During the period January 1, 2016 through September, 2016, the Company had no cash flows related to investing activities.

During the period January 1, 2015 through September 30, 2015, the Company's cash used in investing activities totaled $23,268. The total amount represents funds paid for boiler fan repair and replacement ($2,643), for a petroleum diesel tank/pump set ($1,573), and for storage system enhancements ($19,052) at the NABE facility in Lenoir, NC.

INDEX 

Cash Used In Financing Activities

During the period January 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016, the Company's cash flow related to financing activities totaled $9,298. This amount represents funds paid for short-term debt during the current period.

During the period January 1, 2015 through September 30, 2015, the Company's cash used in financing activities totaled $26,632.  This amount represents payments on long-term debt to third-party creditors. Also during the first three quarters of 2015, the Company borrowed $105,929 from a related party and repaid the full amount during the same period.

Future Financings

We anticipate that additional funding will be required in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock in order to proceed with our acquisition and expansion plan. However, we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock to fund our marketing and acquisition plans. At this time, we do not have any arrangements in place for any future equity financing . 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Management does not expect any financial statement impact from any recently-issued pronouncements.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

(a)     

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, the CEO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016.  We have identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting:

Lack of Independent Board of Directors and Audit Committee 

Management is aware that an audit committee composed of the requisite number of independent members along with a qualified financial expert has not yet been established.  Considering the costs associated with procuring and providing the infrastructure to support an independent audit committee and the limited number of transactions, management has concluded that the risks associated with the lack of an independent audit committee are not sufficient to justify the creation of such a committee at this time.  Management will periodically reevaluate this situation.

15 

INDEX 

Deficiencies in Our Control Environment. 

Our control environment did not sufficiently promote effective internal control over financial reporting throughout the organization. This material weakness exists because of the aggregate effect of multiple deficiencies in internal control which affect our control environment, including: a) the lack of an effective risk assessment process for the identification of fraud risks; b) the lack of an internal audit function or other effective mechanism for ongoing monitoring of the effectiveness of internal controls; c) deficiencies in our accounting system and controls; d) and insufficient documentation and communication of our accounting policies and procedures as of September 30, 2016.

Deficiencies in the staffing of our financial accounting department. 

The number of qualified accounting personnel with experience in public company SEC reporting and GAAP is limited. This weakness does not enable us to maintain adequate controls over our financial accounting and reporting processes regarding the accounting for non-routine and non-systematic transactions. There is a risk that a material misstatement of the financial statements could be caused, or at least not be detected in a timely manner, by this shortage of qualified resources.

Deficiencies in Segregation of Duties. 

The limited number of qualified accounting personnel results in an inability to have independent review and approval of financial accounting entries. Furthermore, management and financial accounting personnel have wide-spread access to create and post entries in our financial accounting system. There is a risk that a material misstatement of the financial statements could be caused, or at least not be detected in a timely manner, due to insufficient segregation of duties.

Because of its inherent limitation, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our financial accounting staff is actively attending and receiving training. Management is still determining additional measures to remediate deficiencies related to staffing.

(b)     

Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In the Court of Common Pleas of the State of South Carolina's Thirteenth Judicial Circuit (Greenville County), a Plaintiff has filed suit against the Company and its subsidiary, NABE. The filing took place in June of 2015. In its filing, the Plaintiff claims to be a subsidiary of a foreign biodiesel producer with which NABE transacted import activities during 2013 and 2014. The Plaintiff further claims that the Company did not have the right to retain the $510,030 that was received and recognized as Other Income during the second quarter of 2015. An agreement signed with a customer in 2014 allowed the Company to retain and recognize this income, which was dependent upon reinstatement of the federal biodiesel blender tax credit. Subsequent to our agreement with the customer, the blender tax credit was retroactively reinstated. The Company recognized the Other Income when the customer, after having successfully filed for the credit, remitted payment to the Company. The Company believes that the Plaintiff's actions are unfounded and that there is remote likelihood of incurring any liability. The Company is vigorously defending the action.
