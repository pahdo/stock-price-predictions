1.      ORGANIZATION     

Through
its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Algodon Wines   Luxury Development Group, Inc. (the  Company ,  Algodon Partners ,
 AWLD ), a Delaware corporation that was incorporated on April 5, 1999, currently invests in, develops and operates
international real estate projects. The Company s wholly-owned subsidiaries are InvestProperty Group, LLC, Algodon Global
Properties, LLC, DPEC Capital, Inc. ( CAP ), and Algodon Europe, Ltd. AWLD also owns approximately 96.5% of Mercari
Communications Group, Ltd. ( Mercari ), a public shell corporation that is current in its SEC reporting obligations
and is a ready target for merger or sale. Mercari is a consolidated subsidiary of the Company and the noncontrolling interest
is negligible.  

Through
its subsidiaries, the Company currently operates Algodon Mansion ( TAR ), a Buenos Aires-based luxury boutique hotel
property and has redeveloped, expanded and repositioned a winery and golf resort property called Algodon Wine Estates ( AWE )
for subdivision of a portion of this property for residential development.  

2.      GOING
                                         CONCERN AND MANAGEMENT S LIQUIDITY PLANS     

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The condensed consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts or the classification of liabilities
that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company incurred losses of $2,146,702
and $7,437,636 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $1,653,427 and $6,535,360 during the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $65,027,064 at September
30, 2016. Cash used in operating activities was $4,785,353 and $5,736,967 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. The aforementioned factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

The
Company needs to raise additional capital in order to expand its business objectives. The Company funded its operations for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 primarily through a private placement offering of common stock for proceeds of $5,547,590
and $5,643,884, respectively. The Company presently has only enough cash on hand to sustain its operations through February 2017.
Historically, the Company has been successful in raising funds to support our capital needs. Management believes that it will
be successful in obtaining additional financing; however, no assurance can be provided that the Company will be able to do so.
There is no assurance that these funds will be sufficient to enable the Company to attain profitable operations or continue as
a going concern. To the extent that the Company is unsuccessful, the Company may need to curtail its operations and implement
a plan to extend payables and reduce overhead until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations. There
can be no assurance that such a plan will be successful. Such a plan could have a material adverse effect on the Company s
business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately the Company could be forced to discontinue its operations,
liquidate and/or seek reorganization in bankruptcy. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

3.      SUMMARY
                                         OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Basis
of Presentation   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do
not include all of the information and disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America for annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, such statements include all adjustments (consisting only
of normal recurring items) which are considered necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements of the Company as of September 30, 2016, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The results
of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for
the full year. It is suggested that these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on March 30, 2016, as amended on March
31, 2016. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 has been derived from the Company s audited consolidated
financial statements.  

Use
of Estimates   

To
prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the
Company must make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in the financial statements,
and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The significant estimates and related
assumptions made by the Company relate to the valuation of equity instruments, the useful lives of property and equipment and
reserves associated with the realizability of certain assets.  

Segment
Information   

The
Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) has established standards for reporting information on operating segments
of an enterprise in interim and annual financial statements. The Company operates in one segment which is the business of real
estate development in Argentina. The Company s chief operating decision-maker reviews the Company s operating results
on an aggregate basis and manages the Company s operations as a single operating segment. Certain activities of the Company
such as the U.S. Broker Dealer Operations, are considered a service or support division to the Company, by providing capital raising
efforts, substantially to support the AWLD real estate development activities, and are not considered a business for segment purposes.  

Reclassifications   

Certain
prior year balances have been reclassified in order to conform to current year presentation. These reclassifications have no effect
on previously reported results of operations or loss per share.

3.      SUMMARY
                                         OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, continued     

Foreign
Currency Translation   

The
Company s functional and reporting currency is the United States dollar. The functional currencies of the Company s
operating subsidiaries are their local currencies (United States dollar, Argentine peso and British pound). There has been a steady
devaluation of the Argentine peso relative to the United States dollar in recent years. Assets and liabilities are translated
into U.S. dollars at the balance sheet date (15.3338 and 12.9441 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively) and
revenue and expense accounts are translated at a weighted average exchange rate for the period or for the year then ended (14.5245
and 8.9612 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively). Resulting translation adjustments are made directly
to accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company engages in foreign currency denominated transactions with customers and
suppliers, as well as between subsidiaries with different functional currencies.  

A
highly inflationary economy is defined as an economy with a cumulative inflation rate of approximately 100 percent or more over
a three-year period. If a country s economy is classified as highly inflationary, the functional currency of the foreign
entity operating in that country must be remeasured to the functional currency of the reporting entity. The official cumulative
inflation rate for Argentina over the last three calendar years approximated 61.4%, although the International Monetary Fund has
concerns regarding the accuracy of the official data.  

Property
and Equipment   

Investments
in property and equipment are recorded at cost. These assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated
useful lives. Most of the Company s assets are located in Argentina and are subject to variation as a result of foreign
currency translation.  

The
Company capitalizes internal vineyard improvement costs when developing new vineyards or replacing or improving existing vineyards.
These costs consist primarily of the costs of the vines and expenditures related to labor and materials to prepare the land and
construct vine trellises. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense as incurred. The cost of properties
sold or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts at the time of disposal
and resulting gains and losses are included as a component of operating income. Real estate development consists of costs incurred
to ready the land for sale, including primarily costs of infrastructure as well as master plan development and associated professional
fees. Given that they are not currently in service, the assets are currently not being depreciated.

3.      SUMMARY
                                         OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, continued     

Stock-Based
Compensation   

The
Company measures the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award.
For employees and directors, the fair value of the award is measured on the grant date and for non-employees, the fair value of
the award is generally re-measured on financial reporting dates and vesting dates until the service period is complete. The fair
value amount of the shares expected to ultimately vest is then recognized over the period services are required to be provided
in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. The estimation of stock-based awards that will ultimately vest requires
judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from original estimates, such amounts are recorded as a
cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. The Company considers many factors when estimating expected forfeitures,
including types of awards, employee class, and historical experience.  

Concentrations   

The
Company maintains cash with major financial institutions. Cash held in US bank institutions is currently insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) up to $250,000 at each institution. No similar insurance or guarantee exists
for cash held in Argentina bank accounts. There were aggregate uninsured cash balances of $255,745 and $45,055 at September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

Comprehensive
Income (Loss)   

Comprehensive
income (loss) is defined as the change in equity of a business during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances
from non-owner sources. It includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and
distributions to owners. The guidance requires other comprehensive income (loss) to include foreign currency translation adjustments.  

Revenue
Recognition   

The
Company earns revenues from its real estate, hospitality, food   beverage, broker-dealer and other related services. Revenues
from rooms, food, and beverage and other operating departments are recognized as earned at the time of sale or rendering of service.
Cash received in advance of the sale or rendering of services is recorded as advance deposits or deferred revenue on the condensed
consolidated balance sheets. Deferred revenues associated with real estate lot sale deposits are recognized as revenues (along
with any outstanding balance) when the lot sale closes and the deed is provided to the purchaser. Other deferred revenues primarily
consist of deposits accepted by the Company in connection with agreements to sell barrels of wine. These wine barrel deposits
are recognized as revenues (along with any outstanding balance) when the barrel of wine is shipped to the purchaser. Sales taxes
and value added ( VAT ) taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a
net basis within revenues in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Net
Loss per Common Share   

Basic
loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, plus the impact of common shares, if dilutive, resulting from the
exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants and the conversion of convertible instruments.  

The
following securities are excluded from the calculation of weighted average dilutive common shares because their inclusion would
have been anti-dilutive:  

New
Accounting Pronouncements   

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting . The amendments are effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016,
and interim periods within those annual periods. Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions
are simplified, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c)
classification on the statement of cash flows. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on
its consolidated financial statements or disclosures.  

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations
and Licensing. The amendments in this update clarify the following two aspects to Topic 606: identifying performance obligations
and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas. The entity first identifies
the promised goods or services in the contract and reduce the cost and complexity. An entity evaluates whether promised goods
and services are distinct. Topic 606 includes implementation guidance on determining whether an entity s promise to grant
a license provides a customer with either a right to use the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied at a point
in time) or a right to access the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied over time). The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-10 on its consolidated financial statements or disclosures.

Accounting Pronouncements, continued   

In
May 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts
with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  ( Update 2016-12 ), amending
Update 2014-09. The amendments do not change the core principles of Update 2014-09, but clarify matters related to assessment
of a collectability criterion, presentation of sales and other taxes collected from customers, non-cash consideration, contract
modifications at transition and completed contracts at transition. The requirements for these standards relating to Topic 606
will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for interim and
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the updated requirements on
its consolidated financial statements.   

In
August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU )
2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic 230)  which provides
guidance on the presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows in order
to reduce diversity in practice. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early
adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its condensed consolidated financial
statements.  

The
Company has implemented all new accounting standards that are in effect and may impact its condensed consolidated financial statements
and does not believe that there are any other new accounting standards that have been issued that might have a material impact
on its financial position or results of operations.

Company s subsidiary, CAP, as a registered broker-dealer, is subject to the SEC s Uniform Net Capital Rule 15c3-1
that requires the maintenance of minimum net capital. This requires that CAP maintain minimum net capital of $5,000 and requires
that the ratio of aggregate indebtedness, as defined, to net capital, shall not exceed 15 to 1.  

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, CAP s net capital exceeded the requirement by $65,705 and $32,078, respectively.  

The
Company had a percentage of aggregate indebtedness to net capital of approximately 11.82 % and 95.8% as of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

Advances,
dividend payments and other equity withdrawals are restricted by the regulations of the SEC, and other regulatory agencies are
subject to certain notification and other provisions of the net capital rules of the SEC. The Company qualifies under the exemptive
provisions of Rule 15c3-3 as the Company does not carry security accounts for customers or perform custodial functions related
to customer securities.  

6.      INVESTMENTS
                                         AND FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS     

Fair
value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company often utilizes certain assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and/or the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation
technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or developed by the Company. The fair value hierarchy
ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. Financial assets and liabilities carried at
fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:  

Level
1 -  Valued based on quoted prices at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities trading in active markets. Financial
instruments in this category generally include actively traded equity securities.  

Level
2 -  Valued based on (a) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; (b) quoted prices for identical
or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; (c) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the
asset or liability; or (d) from market corroborated inputs. Financial instruments in this category include certain corporate equities
that are not actively traded or are otherwise restricted.  

Level
3 -  Valued based on valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs is not readily observable. Included in this
category are certain corporate debt instruments, certain private equity investments, and certain commitments and guarantees.

It
is the Company s policy to distribute part or all of the warrants CAP earns through serving as placement agent on various
private placement offerings for a related but independent entity under common management, to registered representatives or other
employees who provided investment banking services. The Company recorded $1,809 and $19,393 of compensation expense (fair value)
related to these distributed warrants for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. The Company recorded
$37,052 compensation expense (fair value) related to these distributed warrants for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015. Warrants retained by the Company s broker-dealer subsidiary are marked to market at each reporting date using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Unrealized losses on affiliate warrants of $28,079 and $75,568 recorded during the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $29,772 and $170,210 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively,

The
fair value of the warrants was determined based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of highly
subjective assumptions, including the expected share price volatility. Given that such shares were not publicly-traded through
September 30, 2016, the Company developed an expected volatility figure based on a review of the historical volatilities, over
a period of time, of similarly positioned public companies within the industry.  

The
Company s short term financial instruments include cash, accounts receivable, advances and loans to registered representatives,
accounts payable, accrued expenses, deferred revenue, other liabilities, loans payable and debt obligations. The carrying value
of these instruments approximate fair value, as they bear terms and conditions comparable to market, for obligations with similar
terms and maturities.

payroll and payroll tax obligations. The loan matured on May 6, 2016 and bore interest of 10% over term of the loan.  

All
principal and interest due under the loan payable was repaid in full on May 6, 2016.

Options   

The
Company has computed the fair value of options granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Until September 23, 2016,
there was no public trading market for the shares of AWLD common stock underlying the Company s 2008 Equity Incentive Plan
(the  2008 Plan ) and the 2016 Plan. Accordingly, the fair value of the AWLD common stock was estimated by management
based on observations of the cash sales prices of AWLD equity securities. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of valuation and
reduce expense ratably over the vesting period. This estimate will be adjusted periodically based on the extent to which actual
forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the previous estimate, when it is material. The expected term of options granted
to consultants represents the contractual term, whereas the expected term of options granted to employees and directors was estimated
based upon the  simplified  method for  plain-vanilla  options. Given that the Company s shares
were not publicly traded through September 23, 2016, the Company developed an expected volatility figure based on a review of
the historical volatilities, over a period of time, of similarly positioned public companies within its industry. The risk-free
interest rate was determined from the implied yields from U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with a remaining term consistent with
the expected term of the options. The Company estimated forfeitures related to options at an annual rate of 5% for options outstanding
at September 30, 2016  

On
June 15, 2015, the Company granted five-year options to purchase an aggregate of 2,211,890 shares of common stock to employees,
officers, directors and consultants of the Company, pursuant to the 2008 Plan. Options to purchase an aggregate of 2,201,890 shares
had an exercise price of $2.20 per share and an option to purchase 10,000 shares of common stock had an exercise price of $3.30
per share. The options vest over a four year period with one-fourth vesting on June 8, 2016 and the remainder vesting quarterly
thereafter and had an aggregate grant date value of $1,409,900 ($0.64 per share), of which options granted to employees, officers
and directors had an aggregate grant date fair value of $1,251,384, which will be recognized ratably over the vesting period,
while options granted to consultants had an aggregate grant date value of $158,516, which will be re-measured on financial reporting
dates and vesting dates until the service period is complete.  

On
July 19, 2016, the Company granted five-year options to purchase a total of 400,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price
of $2.20 to two members of the Company s Board of Directors pursuant to the 2016 Plan. The options vested one-third on the
date of grant and one-third on each of the two anniversaries subsequent to the date of grant. The options had a grant date value
of $0.60 per share, representing an aggregate grant date value of $239,421.

Legal
Matters   

The
Company is involved in litigation and arbitrations from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not
believe that the outcome of any such pending or threatened litigation will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition
or results of operations. However, as is inherent in legal proceedings, there is a risk that an unpredictable decision adverse
to the company could be reached. The Company records legal costs associated with loss contingencies as incurred. Settlements are
accrued when, and if, they become probable and estimable.  

Consulting
Agreements   

On
or about January 11, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with Maxim Group LLC ( Maxim ) to provide general
financial advisory and investment banking services to the Company. Pursuant to the terms of this agreement, Maxim will receive
a monthly cash fee of $7,500 for the duration of the agreement, which may be terminated by either party at any time after nine
months, or upon 30 days prior written notice to the other party. In connection with the agreement, the Company issued 350,000
shares of restricted common stock valued at $2.50 per share to Maxim (see Note 12   Stockholders  Equity), which vest
11.1% upon execution of the agreement, and 11.1% monthly thereafter. An additional 100,000 shares of restricted stock will be
issued to Maxim upon the uplisting of the Company s common stock to a national exchange.  

The
Company entered into an Investor Relations Consulting Agreement effective April 8, 2016 (the  IR Agreement ) with
MZHCI LLC ( MZHCI ) to provide consulting services with respect to financial markets and exchanges, competitors, business
acquisitions and other related matters in exchange for consideration of $6,500 of cash per month plus five-year warrants for the
purchase of up to 150,000 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $2.50 per share, of which warrants
for the purchase of 75,000 share of common stock were granted on April 18, 2016 (see Note 12   Stockholders  Equity
  Warrants) and warrants for the purchase of additional 75,000 shares of common stock were granted on October 18, 2016.
(See Note 14   Subsequent Events).  

Importer
Agreement   

The
Company entered into an agreement (the  Importer Agreement ) with an importer (the  Importer ) effective
June 1, 2016, pursuant to which the Company has engaged the Importer as its sole and exclusive importer, distributor and marketing
agent of wine in the United States at prices mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Importer. The Importer Agreement terminates
on December 31, 2020, and is renewable for an indefinite number of successive three year terms. The Importer Agreement may be
terminated by the Company or the Importer for cause, as defined in the Importer Agreement.

Item
2: MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
included herein. In connection with, and because we desire to take advantage of, the  safe harbor  provisions of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we caution readers regarding certain forward looking statements in the following
discussion and elsewhere in this report and in any other statement made by us, or on our behalf, whether or not in future filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Forward-looking statements are statements not based on historical information and
which relate to future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. Forward looking statements are necessarily
based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties
and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and many of which, with respect to future business decisions, are subject
to change. These uncertainties and contingencies can affect actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially
from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by, or on our behalf. Words such as  anticipate,   estimate, 
 plan,   continuing,   ongoing,   expect,   believe,   intend, 
 may,   will,   should,   could,  and similar expressions are used to identify
forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements.   

The
independent registered public accounting firm s report on the Company s consolidated financial statements as of December
31, 2015, and for each of the years in the two-year period then ended, includes a  going concern  explanatory paragraph,
that describes substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.   

Unless
the context requires otherwise, references in this document to  AWLD ,  we ,  our ,  us 
or the  Company  are to Algodon Wines   Luxury Development Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries.   

Overview   

We
are an integrated, lifestyle related real estate development company, capitalizing on our unique brand of affordable luxury, branded
as  Algodon , to create a diverse set of interrelated products and services. Our wines, hotels and real estate ventures,
currently concentrated in Argentina, offer a blend of high-end, luxury and adventures products. We hope to further broaden the
reach and depth of our services to strengthen and cement the reach of our brand. Ultimately, we intend to further expand and grow
our business by combining unique and promising opportunities with our brand and clientele.  

Through
our subsidiaries, we currently operate Algodon Mansion, a Buenos Aires-based luxury boutique hotel property, and we have redeveloped,
expanded and repositioned a winery and golf resort property called Algodon Wine Estates for subdivision of a portion of this property
for residential development.  

Investment
in foreign real estate requires consideration of certain risks typically not associated with investing in the United States. Such
risks include trade balances and imbalances and related economic policies, unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations, imposition
of exchange control regulation by the United States or foreign governments, United States and foreign withholding taxes, limitations
on the removal of funds or other assets, policies of governments with respect to possible nationalization of their industries,
political difficulties including expropriation of assets, confiscatory taxation and economic or political instability in foreign
nations or changes in laws which affect foreign investors.  

Recent
Developments and Trends   

Financings

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we raised approximately $1.3 and $5.5 million, respectively, of new capital
from the issuance of common stock for cash.  

Initiatives

We
have implemented a number of initiatives designed to expand revenues and control costs. Revenue enhancement initiatives include
expanding marketing, investment in additional winery capacity and developing new real estate development revenue sources. Cost
reduction initiatives include investment in equipment that will decrease our reliance on subcontractors, as well as outsourcing
and restructuring of certain functions. Our goal is to become more self-sufficient and less dependent on outside financing.  

Liquidity   

As
reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements, we have generated significant losses which have resulted in a total
accumulated deficit of approximately $65 million, raising substantial doubt that we will be able to continue operations as a going
concern. Our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in their report for the years ended
December 31, 2015 and 2014, stating that we have incurred significant losses and need to raise additional funds to meet our obligations
and sustain our operations. Our ability to execute our business plan is dependent upon our generating cash flow and obtaining
additional debt or equity capital sufficient to fund operations. If we are able to obtain additional debt or equity capital (of
which there can be no assurance), we hope to acquire additional management, as well as increase the marketing of our products
and continue the development of our real estate holdings.  

Our
business strategy may not be successful in addressing these issues, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain
any additional capital. If we cannot execute our business plan on a timely basis (including acquiring additional capital), our
stockholders may lose their entire investment in us, because we may have to delay vendor payments and/or initiate cost reductions,
which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately we could
be forced to discontinue our operations, liquidate and/or seek reorganization under the U.S. bankruptcy code.  

Consolidated
Results of Operations   

Three
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to three months ended September 30, 2015    

Overview   

We
reported net losses of approximately $2.1 million and $1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
This increase in net loss of $0.4 million is primarily due to a decrease in gross profit during the period.  

Revenues   

Revenues
were approximately $327,000 and $593,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing
a decrease of $266,000 or 45%. Increases in hotel and wine revenues of approximately $356,000 were offset by $227,000 decreases
in broker-dealer revenues and a $395,000 decrease in revenues resulting from the impact of the decline in the value of the Argentine
peso vis- -vis the U.S. dollar in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same quarter in 2015.  

Gross
loss   

We
generated a gross loss of approximately $209,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the gross income
of $148,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, representing a decrease of $357,000 or 241%. The unfavorable variance
results primarily from the aforementioned decrease in broker-dealer revenues, for which costs of sales are relatively fixed, and
from the impact of the decline in the value of the Argentine peso vis- -vis the U.S. dollar in the third quarter of 2016
compared to the same quarter in 2015.  

Cost
of sales, which consists of raw materials, direct labor and indirect labor associated with our business activities, increased
by approximately $91,000 from $445,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $536,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2016. The $450,000 increase in wine and hotel cost of sales results was partially offset by a $359,000 decrease in cost of
sales resulting from the impact of the decline in the value of the Argentine peso vis- -vis the U.S. dollar in the third
quarter of 2016 compared to the same quarter in 2015.  

Selling
and marketing expenses   

Selling
and marketing expenses were approximately $2,000 and $40,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
representing a decrease of $38,000 or 94% primarily due to a decrease in marketing costs resulting from the renegotiation of pricing
with certain marketing providers and consultants, and the reduction in public relations and marketing campaigns from the prior
period.  

General
and administrative expenses   

General
and administrative expenses were approximately $1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $1.7
million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, representing an increase of $0.2 million or 12%. Significant variations
in general and administrative expense included a $0.3 million increase in stock based compensation resulting from the vesting
of restricted stock and warrants issued to consultants in connection with the Company s entry into agreements for financial
advisory and investor relations services, a $0.1 million increase in professional fees, and a $0.1 million increase in occupancy
costs and office expenses, which were offset by a $0.1 million decrease from the impact of the fluctuations in exchange rate the
Argentine peso to the United States dollar; and $0.2 million decreases in commissions and stock based compensation to registered
representatives due to reduced capital raises.  

Depreciation
and amortization expense   

Depreciation
and amortization expense was approximately $11,000 and $54,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
representing a decrease of $43,000 or 79%. The decrease in depreciation charges is attributable to fully depreciated hotel assets,
as well as to the decline of in value of the Argentine peso vis- -vis the U.S. dollar as most of our property and equipment
is located in Argentina.  

Interest
expense, net   

Interest
expense was approximately $53,000 and $34,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing
an increase of $19,000 or 56% resulting from interest accrued related to deferred salary obligations.  

Nine
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2015    

Overview   

We
reported net losses of approximately $7.4 million and $6.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
reflecting an increase in net losses of $0.9 million or 14%. The increase in net loss is primarily due to an approximately $0.9
million non-cash charge resulting from the issuance of stock for no consideration to our existing stockholders, in order to effectively
reduce the price of shares previously purchased for $2.50 per share, to $2.00 per share.  

Revenues   

Revenues
were approximately $1.1 million and $1.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, reflecting
a decrease of $0.3 million or 21%. Decreases of $0.8 million resulting from the decline in the value of the Argentine peso vis- -vis
the U.S. dollar and a $0.1 decrease in broker-dealer revenues were partially offset by increases of $0.3 million in hotel revenues
and $0.3 million in wine and agricultural sales.  

Gross
loss   

We
generated a gross loss of approximately $165,000 and $131,000, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
representing an increase in gross loss of $34,000. The unfavorable variance results primarily from the aforementioned decrease
in broker-dealer revenues, for which costs of sales are relatively fixed, and from the impact of the decline in the value of the
Argentine peso vis- -vis the U.S. dollar i n the first nine months of 2016 compared to the comparable period in 2015.  

Cost
of sales, which consists of raw materials, direct labor and indirect labor associated with our business activities, decreased
by approximately $290,000, from $1,565,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to approximately $1,275,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016. Increases in (i) costs of hotel revenues of $280,000; (ii) cost of wine sales of $231,000, and
(iii) other costs of sales of $8,000 were offset by a $809,000 decrease in costs of sales resulting from the impact of the decline
in the value of the Argentine peso vis- -vis the U.S. dollar in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the comparable
period in 2015.  

Selling
and marketing expenses   

Selling
and marketing expenses were approximately $85,000 and $177,000, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
representing a decrease of $92,000 or 52%. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in marketing costs resulting from
the renegotiation of pricing with certain marketing providers and consultants, and the reduction in public relations and marketing
campaigns as compared to the same period in 2015.  

General
and administrative expenses   

General
and administrative expenses were approximately $6.0 million and $5.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively, representing an increase of $0.1 million or 1%. Significant variances in general and administrative expense
included a $0.7 million increase in stock-based compensation resulting from the vesting of restricted stock and warrants issued
to consultants and $0.3 million increase in consulting expenses in connection with the Company s entry into agreements for
financial advisory and investor relations services, as well as an increase in severance costs during the period of $0.3 million.
These increases were offset by a $0.6 million decrease resulting from the impact of the decline in the value of the Argentine
peso vis- -vis the U.S. dollar for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 201, as well
as a $0.3 million decrease in administrative compensation expense, primarily due to staff reductions during the period and a $0.3
million decrease in commissions and stock-based compensation to registered representatives.  

Depreciation
and amortization expense   

Depreciation
and amortization expense was approximately $63,000 and $185,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
representing a decrease of $122,000 or 66%. It should be noted that an additional $38,000 and $132,000 of depreciation and amortization
expense was capitalized to inventory during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in depreciation
charges is attributable to fully depreciated hotel assets, as well as to the decline of in value of the Argentine peso vis- -vis
the U.S. dollar as most of our property and equipment is located in Argentina.  

Interest
expense, net   

Interest
expense was approximately $144,000 and $188,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing
a decrease of $44,000 or 23% resulting primarily from the impact of the decline in the value of the Argentine peso vis- -vis
the U.S. dollar for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015.  

Common
stock price modification   

We
recognized common stock price modification expense of approximately $942,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
related to the issuance of 470,771 shares of our common stock for no consideration, to investors who had previously purchased
shares at a price of $2.50 per share, in order to effectively reduce their per share price to $2.00 per share.  

Warrant
modification expense   

Warrant
modification expense of approximately of $69,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is related to the modification
of the warrants (the  CAP Warrants ) previously issued to registered representatives of our subsidiary DPEC Capital,
Inc. ( CAP ) who acted as the Company s placement agent. On June 1, 2016, the Company modified CAP Warrants
granted between December 2015 and May 2016, such that the exercise price was adjusted from $2.50 per share to $2.00 per share,
and the aggregate number of shares available to be purchased in connection with the warrants was increased from 198,807 to 245,883
shares.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

We
measure our liquidity a variety of ways, including the following:  

Based
upon our working capital situation as of September 30, 2016, we require additional equity and/or debt financing in order to sustain
operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  

We
have relied primarily on debt and equity private placement offerings to third party independent, accredited investors to sustain
operations. These offerings were conducted by our wholly-owned subsidiary DPEC Capital, Inc. Additionally, from time to time,
we secured individual, direct loans from our CEO and other shareholders.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we issued common stock to accredited investors in a private placement transaction for
gross proceeds of $5,547,590. The proceeds from these financing activities were used to fund our existing operating deficits,
legal and accounting expenses associated with being a public company, capital expenditures associated with our real estate development
projects, enhanced marketing efforts to increase revenues and the general working capital needs of the business.  

Availability
of Additional Funds    

As
a result of the above developments, we have been able to sustain operations. However, we will need to raise additional capital
in order to meet our future liquidity needs for operating expenses, additional capital expenditures for the winery expansion and
to further invest in our real estate development. If we are unable to obtain adequate funds on reasonable terms, we may be required
to significantly curtail or discontinue operations.  

Sources
and Uses of Cash for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    

Net
Cash Used in Operating Activities   

Net
cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to approximately $4,785,000 and
$5,737,000, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the net cash used in operating activities was primarily
attributable to the net loss of approximately $7,438,000 adjusted for approximately $2,831,000 of net non-cash expenses, and approximately
$178,000 of cash used by changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities. During the nine months ended September 30,
2015, the net cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to the net loss of approximately $6,535,000 adjusted
for approximately $1,360,000 of non-cash expenses, and approximately $562,000 of cash used in by changes in the levels of operating
assets and liabilities.  

Net
Cash Used in Investing Activities   

Net
cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to approximately $260,000 and
$370,000, respectively, and was primarily related to the purchase of property and equipment.  

Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities   

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to approximately $5,498,000
and $5,494,000, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the net cash provided by financing activities resulted
primarily from the offering of equity securities for proceeds of approximately $5,548,000, partially offset by the repayments
of debt of $50,000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the net cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily
from the offering of equity securities for proceeds of approximately $5,644,000, partially offset by the repayment of debt of
$150,000.  

Going
Concern and Management s Liquidity Plans   

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern,
which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.
As discussed in Note 2 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, we have not achieved a sufficient level
of revenues to support our business and development activities and have suffered substantial recurring losses from operations
since our inception, which conditions raise substantial doubt that we will be able to continue operations as a going concern.
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we were
unable to continue as a going concern.  

Based
on current cash on hand and subsequent activity as described herein, our cash-on-hand only allows us to operate our business operations
through January 2017. While we are exploring opportunities with third parties and related parties to provide some or all of the
capital we need over the short and long terms, we have not entered into any external agreement to provide us with the necessary
capital. Historically, the Company has been successful in raising funds to support our capital needs. If we are unable to obtain
additional financing on a timely basis, we may have to delay vendor payments and/or initiate cost reductions, which would have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately we could be forced to
discontinue our operations, liquidate and/or seek reorganization under the U.S. bankruptcy code. As a result, our auditors have
issued a going concern opinion in conjunction with their audit of our December 31, 2015 and 2014 consolidated financial statements.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

None.  

Contractual
Obligations   

As
a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information requested by paragraph (a)(5) of this Item.  

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates   

There
are no material changes from the critical accounting policies set forth in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations  set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 30,
2016, as amended on March 31, 2016. Please refer to that document for disclosures regarding the critical accounting policies related
to our business.  

New
Accounting Pronouncements   

We
have implemented all new accounting standards that are in effect and may impact our condensed consolidated financial statements
and we do not believe that there are any other new accounting standards that have been issued that might have a material impact
on our financial position or results of operations, except as disclosed below.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting . The amendments are effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016,
and interim periods within those annual periods. Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions
are simplified, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c)
classification on the statement of cash flows. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on its consolidated
financial statements or disclosures.  

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations
and Licensing. The amendments in this update clarify the following two aspects to Topic 606: identifying performance obligations
and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas. The entity first identifies
the promised goods or services in the contract and reduce the cost and complexity. An entity evaluates whether promised goods
and services are distinct. Topic 606 includes implementation guidance on determining whether an entity s promise to grant
a license provides a customer with either a right to use the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied at a point
in time) or a right to access the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied over time). We are currently evaluating
the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-10 on its consolidated financial statements or disclosures.  

In
May 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts
with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  ( Update 2016-12 ), amending
Update 2014-09. The amendments do not change the core principles of Update 2014-09, but clarify matters related to assessment
of a collectability criterion, presentation of sales and other taxes collected from customers, non-cash consideration, contract
modifications at transition and completed contracts at transition. The requirements for these standards relating to Topic 606
will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for interim and
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact of the updated requirements on its consolidated
financial statements.

August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU )
2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic 230)  which provides
guidance on the presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows in order
to reduce diversity in practice. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early
adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its condensed consolidated financial statements.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk   

As
a  smaller reporting company  as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information
required by this Item.  

Item
4: Controls and Procedures   

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures    

Our
management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (who is
our Principal Executive Officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (who is our Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting
Officer), of the effectiveness of the design of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)
or 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2016, pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b). Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive
Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30,
2016.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting    

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting, or in other
factors that could significantly affect these controls, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.  

Inherent
Limitations of Controls     

Management
does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect
all error and all fraud. Controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
controls and procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations
include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error
or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people,
or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals
under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or deterioration
in the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

the merits and risks of investment in the Company and able to bear the risk of loss. For this sale of securities, the Company
relied on the exemption from registration available under Section 4(a)(2) and Rule 506(b) of Regulation D promulgated under the
Securities Act with respect to transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering. No general solicitation was used in
this offering. A Form D was filed on October 8, 2015.  

On
July 11, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted the 2016 Stock Option Plan (the  2016 Plan ). On July
19, 2016, options to purchase a total of 400,000 shares were granted to two directors at an exercise price of $2.20 per share.
On October 20, 2016, the Board adopted amendments to the 2016 Plan to clarify certain items in Section 2 Definitions and
Section 4 Shares Available for Awards. On or about October 20, 2016, the Company granted options to purchase a total of
500,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $2.20 to certain employees of the Company pursuant to the 2016 Stock Option
Plan, as amended.
