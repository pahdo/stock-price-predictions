Note 1. Organization, Description of Business, and Basis of Presentation 
  We are a provider of liquid and solid containment solutions, operating within a specialty sector of the broader industrial services industry. Our revenue is generated by providing rental equipment, customized solutions, and various services to our customers. We provide a wide variety of steel and polyethylene temporary storage tanks, roll-off containers, pumps, filtration, pipes, hoses and fittings, shoring, and related products to a broad range of customers for a number of applications. Tank and roll-off container applications include the storage of water, chemicals, waste streams, and solid waste. Pump applications include the pumping of groundwater, municipal waste, and other fluids. Filtration applications include the separation of various solids from liquids. We serve a variety of industries, including industrial and environmental remediation, refining, environmental services, construction, chemicals, transportation, power, municipal works, and oil and gas. We have branches within   22   states in the United States as well as branches in Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. For reporting purposes, a branch is defined as a location with at least   one   employee. As used herein, the terms  Company,   we,   us,  and  our  refer to BakerCorp International, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates to the contrary. 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and the instructions to Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) Form 10-Q and Article 10 of SEC Regulation S-X. They do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. Therefore, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended   January 31, 2016  , included in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 20, 2016. Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current financial presentation. 
    
  The interim condensed consolidated financial statements included herein are unaudited; however, they contain all normal recurring accruals and adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair statement of our results of operations and financial position for the interim periods. The results of operations for the three and   nine   months ended   October 31, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future quarters or the full year. 
    
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions with our subsidiaries have been eliminated. 
    
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make a number of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities on the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, judgments, and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, allowances for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation, customer rebates, sales returns and allowances, medical insurance claims, litigation accruals, impairment of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill, depreciation, contingencies, income taxes, share-based compensation (expense and liability), and derivatives. Our estimates, judgments, and assumptions are based on historical experience, future expectations, and other factors which we believe to be reasonable. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.

Note   2  . Accounting Pronouncements 
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
       
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  ( ASU No. 2015-11 ). ASU No. 2015-11 requires inventory to be measured  at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  Net realizable value is defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. For non-public business entities, ASU No. 2015-11 is effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted this standard beginning May 1, 2016 on a prospective basis. There was no financial statement impact of adopting ASU No. 2015-11 during the six months ended October 31, 2016. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05,  Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement  ( ASU No. 2015-05 ). ASU No. 2015-05 amends ASC 350,  Intangibles - Goodwill and Other.  The amendments provide guidance as to whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license and, based on that determination, how to account for such arrangements. The amendments may be applied on either a prospective or retrospective basis. The provisions are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods in annual periods beginning after December 31, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted this standard beginning February 1, 2016 on a prospective basis. There was no financial statement impact of adopting ASU No. 2015-05 during the nine months ended October 31, 2016. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,  Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ( ASU No. 2015-03 ). ASU No. 2015-03 requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the debt liability rather than as an asset. The update requires retrospective application and represents a change in accounting principle. ASU No. 2015-03 does not specifically address requirements for the presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements.  
    
  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15,  Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements,  clarifying that debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements could be presented as an asset and amortized over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The standard is effective for non-public entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted.  
    
  We adopted ASU No. 2015-03 and ASU No. 2015-15 beginning February 1, 2016 on a retrospective basis and elected to classify debt issuance costs including those related to line-of-credit arrangements as a direct reduction from the debt liability. The impact of retrospectively adopting the above guidance as of January 31, 2016 was a reduction of our total assets and liabilities as follows: 

As a result of adopting ASU No. 2015-03 and ASU No. 2015-15,  Deferred financing costs, net  are no longer separately classified within total assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flow (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU No. 2016-15 ). ASU No. 2016-15 clarifies the guidance in ASC 230 on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. The standard is effective for non-public entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU No. 2016-15 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  ( ASU No. 2016-12 ). ASU No. 2016-12 provides clarification to Topic 606 on how to assess collectability, present sales tax, treat non-cash consideration, and account for completed and modified contracts at the time of transition. In addition, ASU No. 2016-12 clarifies that an entity retrospectively applying the guidance in Topic 606 is not required to disclose the effect of the accounting change in the period of adoption. The standard is effective for non-public entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU No. 2016-12 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  ( ASU No. 2016-10 ). ASU No. 2016-10 simplifies the guidance surrounding the identification of performance obligations and improves the implementation guidance on identifying licensing arrangements within customer contracts.  The standard is effective for non-public entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU No. 2016-10 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU No. 2016-09 ). ASU No. 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payments transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either liability or equity, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The standard is effective for non-public entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  ( ASU No. 2016-08 ). The amendments in ASU No. 2016-08 affect the guidance in ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).  ASU No. 2016-08 applies when a third party is involved in providing goods or services to a customer. In such circumstance, ASU No. 2016-08 requires an entity to determine whether the nature of its promise is to provide the specified good or service itself to the customer (that is, the entity is a principal) or to arrange for that good or service to be provided by the third party to the customer (that is, the entity is an agent for the third party). If the entity is a principal, upon satisfying a performance obligation, the entity recognizes revenue in the gross amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for the specified good or service transferred to the customer. If the entity is an agent, the entity recognizes revenue in the amount of any fee or commission to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for arranging for the specified good or service to be provided by the third party. The standard is effective for non-public entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU No. 2016-08 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU No. 2016-02 ). This amendment requires the recognition of lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet by lessees for those leases currently classified as operating leases under ASC 840  Leases  and increases the disclosure requirements surrounding these leases. For non-public business entities, ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements.

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)  ( ASU No. 2014-15 ). Under GAAP, a going concern is presumed unless and until an entity s liquidation becomes imminent. When an entity s liquidation becomes imminent, financial statements should be prepared under the liquidation basis of accounting in accordance with Subtopic 205-30,  Presentation of Financial Statements Liquidation Basis of Accounting.  However, there may be conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, even if liquidation is not imminent. In those situations, financial statements should continue to be prepared under the going concern basis of accounting. ASU No. 2014-15 provides guidance about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to determine whether to disclose information about relevant conditions and events. ASU No. 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. ASU No. 2014-15 will be effective for the Company beginning with the year ending January 31, 2017. We are assessing the impact, if any, that the adoption of ASU No. 2014-15 may have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  During May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ( ASU No. 2014-09 ). ASU No. 2014-09 will require companies to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  ASU No. 2014-09 creates a five-step model that requires companies to exercise judgment when considering the terms of the contract(s) which include (i) identifying the contract(s) with the customer, (ii) identifying the separate performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determining the transaction price, (iv) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations, and (v) recognizing revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. ASU No. 2014-09 allows for either full retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or modified retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements. A decision about which method to use will affect a company s implementation plans. The standard is effective for non-public entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements.

Property and equipment, net consisted of the following as of   January 31, 2016  : 

We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying value, a write-down would be recorded to reduce the related carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value. 
  During the three months ended October 31, 2016, we determined that the limited sales volume for certain aged property and equipment was a potential indicator of impairment. We determined that the net book value of these assets exceeded the assets  estimated fair value. Consequently, during the three months ended October 31, 2016, we recorded an impairment charge of   $3.9 million   in our North American segment.  
  During the three months ended July 31, 2016, certain assets that were on long-term rentals were returned in a condition beyond repair. We determined that the net book value of these assets exceeded the assets  estimated fair value. Consequently, during the three months ended July 31, 2016, we recorded an impairment charge of   $0.4 million   in our North American segment.  
  Due to certain indicators of impairment identified during our interim impairment test of goodwill during the three months ended April 30, 2016 (see Note 6), we assessed our long-lived assets for impairment in North America. We tested the property and equipment for recoverability by comparing the sum of undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the North American reporting unit asset group and concluded there were no indicators of impairment. 
  During the three months ended April 30, 2015, we reassessed our plans for the use of certain internally developed software and decided to shift to a different platform which will provide the same services at a lower maintenance cost. We wrote down the value of the internally developed software as no future benefits were expected to be realized. Consequently, during the three months ended April 30, 2015, we recorded an impairment charge of   $0.3 million  . 
  During the three months ended October 31, 2015, we determined that the limited sales volume for certain aged property and equipment was a potential indicator of impairment. We determined that the net book value of these assets exceeded the assets  estimated fair value. Consequently, during the three months ended October 31, 2015, we recorded an impairment charge of   2.7 million   in our North American segment.

Depreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment for the   nine months ended October 31, 2016   and   October 31, 2015   was   $33.1 million   and   $35.7 million  , respectively.

    The adjustments to goodwill were the result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the balance into U.S. dollars. 
          
  We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. In evaluating goodwill, a two-step goodwill impairment test is applied to each reporting unit. In the first step of the impairment test, we compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit s carrying amount, including goodwill. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on income and market approaches. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the amount of the impairment loss must be measured (the second step or  Step 2 ). Any change in the assumptions input into the fair value model, which include market-driven assumptions, could result in future impairments. 
  During the three months ended April 30, 2016, we encountered a reduction in our operating results in comparison to our forecast, primarily due to greater weakness in upstream oil and gas than anticipated, slower rebound in our construction business, and the delay of capital projects by refinery and power plants which can be seen through our lower volume of work with industrial service customers. As a result of the decline in demand for our products and services, we re-assessed our revenue and EBITDA forecast beginning with fiscal year 2017 using a bottoms-up approach, having conversations with our key customers, and performing an analysis on current market conditions and industry spending behavior. Based on our assessment, we noted that despite the recent stabilization of oil prices during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, there will be continued uncertainty in the energy market resulting in a slow-down in capital spend. As a result, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we updated our projections to reflect the decline in activity for the remainder of fiscal year 2017, adjusted our forecast for the outer years to maintain similar growth rates as our previous forecast, and performed the first step of the goodwill impairment test. 
  Under the first step of the impairment test, we determined the carrying value of the North American reporting unit exceeded fair value. The fair value of the European reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, suggesting no indication of potential goodwill impairment. We then performed the second step of the impairment test for the North American reporting unit and calculated the implied fair value of goodwill, which was less than its carrying value. Based on our analysis, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of   $65.7 million   in our North American reporting unit. This impairment charge, which is included under the caption  Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended October 31, 2016, does not impact our operations, compliance with our debt covenants or our cash flows.  
  In calculating the fair value of our North American reporting unit under the first step, we gave equal weight to the income approach, which analyzed projected discounted cash flows, and the market approach, which considered comparable public companies as well as comparable industry transactions. Under the income approach, we estimate future capital expenditures required to maintain our rental fleet under normalized operations and utilize the following Level 3 estimates and assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis: 
             
    Long-term EBITDA margin range of   25.8%   to   30.5%  , reflecting our historical and forecasted profit margins; 
                
    Long-term revenue growth rate range of   3.0%   to   8.0%   based on long-term nominal growth rate potential; 
                
    A discount rate of   10.0%   based on our weighted average cost of capital. 
     
   12 

     Table of Contents  

Under the market approach, we used other significant observable market inputs including various peer company comparisons and industry transaction data, which resulted in revenue and EBITDA market multiples of   1.75  x to   2.00  x and   6.00  x to   7.50  x, respectively. In evaluating our market multiples, we placed higher consideration on peer companies that were experiencing similar oil and gas pressures. Changes in the estimates utilized under the income and market approaches could materially affect the determination of fair value and the conclusions of the step one analysis for the reporting unit. 
    
  Other Intangible Assets, Net 
    
  The components of other intangible assets, net were the following as of: 

(1)  
    $18.3 million   of the total decrease in the gross intangible assets balance on   October 31, 2016   compared to   January 31, 2016   is due to the impairment charge recorded during the three months ended April 30, 2016 (see further details below). The offsetting increase was the result of fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates used to translate foreign intangible asset balances into U.S. dollars. 
     We evaluate the carrying value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset (trade name) annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. To test our indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment, we compare the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset to carrying value. We estimate the fair value using an income approach using the asset s projected discounted cash flows. We recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. 
  We assess the impairment of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The asset is impaired if its carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. In assessing recoverability, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. The impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. We estimate fair value utilizing the projected discounted cash flow method and a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model. When calculating fair value, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows, discount rates and other factors.  
  Due to certain indicators of impairment identified during our April 30, 2016 interim impairment test of goodwill, we assessed our indefinite and definite-lived intangible assets for impairment. Based on our analysis, we concluded that the carrying value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset (trade name) exceeded its fair value and recorded an impairment charge of   $18.3 million   in our North American reporting unit. This impairment charge, which is included under the caption  Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended October 31, 2016, does not impact our operations, compliance with our debt covenants or our cash flows. We estimated the fair value of our trade name using the relief-from-royalty method, which uses several significant assumptions, including an estimate of useful life and revenue projections that consider historical and estimated future results, general economic and market conditions, as well as the impact of planned business and operational strategies. The following estimates and assumptions were also used in the relief-from-royalty method: 
             
    Royalty rate of   1.5%   based on market observed royalty rates; and 
                
    A discount rate of   12.0%   based on the required rate of return for the trade name asset. 
     There was no impairment recorded for our definite-lived intangible assets.

  Instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below: 

As discussed in Note 10,  Derivatives,  our interest rate swap liabilities expired as of July 31, 2016. We did not enter into any new interest rate swap contracts during the three and   nine months ended October 31, 2016  .  
  Interest expense related to our interest rate swap contracts during the   three months ended October 31, 2016   and   2015   was   $0.0 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively, and during the   nine months ended October 31, 2016   and   2015   was   $1.0 million   and   $1.4 million  , respectively. 
    
  Level 3 Valuations  
       
  When at least one significant valuation model assumption or input used to measure the fair value of financial assets or liabilities is unobservable in the market, they are deemed to be measured using Level 3 inputs. These Level 3 inputs may include pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques where at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable. We use Level 3 inputs to value our share-based compensation liability, which were based upon internal valuations, considering input from third parties, utilizing the following assumptions (See Note 12,  Shareholder s Equity ):  
             
    Current Common Stock Value   - We operate as a privately-owned company, and our stock does not and has not been traded on a market or an exchange. As such, we estimate the value of BakerCorp International Holdings, Inc. ( BCI Holdings ) on a quarterly basis. If there have been no significant changes such as acquisitions, disposals, or loss of a major customer between our valuation analysis and the grant date of a stock option, we will continue to use that valuation. We determined the fair value of BCI Holdings common stock based on an analysis of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, we estimated the fair value based on market multiples of EBITDA for comparable public companies.   
                
    Expected Volatility   - Management determined that historical volatility of comparable publicly traded companies is the best indicator of our expected volatility and future stock price trends.  
                
    Expected Dividends   -We historically have not paid cash dividends, and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends, and thus have assumed a   0%   dividend rate.  
                
    Expected Term   - For options granted  at-the-money,  we used the simplified method to estimate the expected term for the stock options as we do not have enough historical exercise data to provide a reasonable estimate. For stock options granted  out-of-the-money,  we used an adjusted simplified method that considers the probability of the stock options becoming  in-the-money.   
                
    Risk-Free Rate   - The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield with a maturity date closest to the expiration date of the stock option grant.  
       
  We determined that a +/-10% change in the above assumptions would not have a significant impact to our reported net loss for the three and nine months ended   October 31, 2016  . During the three and nine months ended   October 31, 2016  , there were   no   transfers in or out of Level 3 instruments.

The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of our share-based compensation liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3): 

Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
  Some of our financial instruments are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis but are recorded at amounts that approximate fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature. Such financial assets and financial liabilities include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivables, inventories, certain other assets, accounts payable, and accrued expenses. 
  Our long-term debt is not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based on the latest sales price for similar instruments obtained from a third party (Level 2 inputs). As of   October 31, 2016   and January 31, 2016, the fair values of our senior notes and senior term loan were   $192.0 million   and   $352.2 million  , respectively, and   $166.8 million   and   $341.8 million  , respectively. 
    
  Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 
  We reduce the carrying amounts of our goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets to fair value when held for sale or determined to be impaired. During the three months ended April 30, 2016, we encountered a reduction in our operating results in comparison to our forecast and, as such, re-assessed our revenue and EBITDA projections. This resulted in impairment charges to write down goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (see Note 6,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Net ). The Company determined the fair values using income and market approaches. The estimation of fair value and cash flows used in the fair value measurements required the use of significant unobservable inputs, and as a result, the fair value measurements were classified as Level 3.

Note   9  . Debt 
    
  Long-term debt consisted of the following as of: 

On June 1, 2011, we (i) entered into a   $435.0 million   senior secured credit facility (the  Credit Facility ), consisting of a   $390.0 million   term loan facility (the  Senior Term Loan ) and a   $45.0 million   revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Credit Facility ) (  $45.0 million   available on   October 31, 2016  , and, as described below, the revolving credit facility was reduced to $40.0 million on November 3, 2016) and (ii) issued   $240.0 million   in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2019 (the  Notes ). 
    
  Credit Facility 
  On February 7, 2013, we entered into a first amendment to refinance our Credit Facility (the  First Amendment ). Pursuant to the First Amendment, we borrowed   $384.2 million   of term loans (the  Amended Senior Term Loan ) to refinance a like amount of term loans (the  Original Term Loan ) under the Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to   LIBOR   plus an applicable margin, subject to a LIBOR floor of   1.25%  . The LIBOR margin applicable to the Amended Senior Term Loan is   3.00%  , which is   0.75%   less than the LIBOR margin applicable to the Original Term Loan. In addition, (i) the Senior Term Loan maturity date was extended to February 7, 2020, provided that the maturity will be March 2, 2019 if the Amended Senior Term Loan is not repaid or refinanced on or prior to March 2, 2019, (ii) the Revolving Credit Facility maturity date was extended to February 7, 2018, and (iii) we obtained increased flexibility with respect to certain covenants and restrictions relating to our ability to incur additional debt, make investments, debt prepayments, and acquisitions. Principal on the Senior Term Loan is payable in quarterly installments of   $1.0 million  . Furthermore, the excess cash flow prepayment requirement is in effect until the maturity date. 
  On November 13, 2013, we entered into a second amendment to our Credit Facility (the  Second Amendment ). Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Company borrowed   $35.0 million   of incremental term loans (the  Incremental Term Loan ), which may be used for general corporate purposes, including to finance permitted acquisitions.   The terms applicable to the Incremental Term Loan are the same as those applicable to the term loans under the Credit Facility.      
    
  The Credit Facility, as amended, places certain limitations on our (and all of our U.S. subsidiaries ) ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other distributions, repurchase capital stock, make certain investments, enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates, utilize assets as security in other transactions, and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies. In addition, under the Credit Facility, we may be required to satisfy and maintain a total leverage ratio if there is an outstanding balance on the revolving loan of   25%   or more of the committed amount on any quarter end. 
    
  On   October 31, 2016  , we did not have an outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility; therefore, on   October 31, 2016  , we were not subject to a leverage test. Additionally, on   October 31, 2016  , we were in compliance with all of our requirements and covenant tests under the Credit Facility. 
    
  On November 3, 2016, we entered into a third amendment to our Credit Facility (the  Third Amendment ) to amend the Revolving Credit Facility. The amendment (i) extends our maturity date from   February 7, 2018   to   November 7, 2019   (provided that such maturity date will be accelerated to   January 30, 2019   unless the Company s senior notes are repaid in full or extended or refinanced on or prior to January 30, 2019) and (ii) reduces the revolver commitment from   $45.0 million   to   $40.0 million   in addition to certain other amendments to the original terms. Under the amended Credit Facility, we may be required to satisfy and maintain a total leverage ratio if there is an outstanding balance on the revolving loan of   28%   or more of the committed amount on any quarter end.

The Third Amendment is accounted for as debt modification. Costs incurred in connection with the Third Amendment will be deferred and amortized over the term of the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, any unamortized deferred costs related to the old arrangement will be written off in proportion to the decrease in borrowing capacity. As of October 31, 2016, we incurred and recorded   $0.2 million   to deferred costs related to the Third Amendment. 
    
  Senior Unsecured Notes Due 2019 
  On June 1, 2011, we issued   $240.0 million   of fixed rate   8.25%   notes due   June 1, 2019   (the  Notes ). We may redeem all or any portion of the Notes at the redemption prices set forth in the applicable indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Upon a change of control, we are required to make an offer to redeem all of the Notes from the holders at a redemption price equal to   101%   of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of the repurchase. The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by our direct and indirect existing and future wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries. 
    
  Interest and Fees 
  Costs related to debt financing are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt instruments utilizing the straight-line method for our revolving credit facility and the effective interest method for our senior term and incremental term loan facilities. We amortized   $0.8 million   and   $0.6 million   of deferred financing costs during the   three months ended October 31, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , respectively, and   $2.2 million   and   $2.0 million   during the   nine months ended October 31, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Interest and fees related to our Credit Facility and the Notes were as follows: 

(1)    Interest on the Amended Term Loan is payable quarterly based upon an interest rate of   4.25%  . 
  (2)    Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually based upon a fixed annual rate of   8.25%  . 
    
  Principal Payments on Debt 
  As of   October 31, 2016  , minimum required principal payments related to the Credit Facility and the Notes for each of the fiscal years ending January 31 are as follows:

Note 10. Derivatives 
    
  Cash Flow Hedges 
    We utilized interest rate derivative contracts to hedge cash flows related to the variable interest rate exposure on our debt. Our use of interest rate derivative contracts was not intended or designed to be used for trading or speculative purposes. For these interest rate swap contracts, we agreed to pay fixed interest rates while receiving a floating LIBOR. The purpose of holding these interest rate swap contracts was to hedge against the upward movement of LIBOR and the associated interest we pay on our external variable rate credit facilities.    During the three months ended July 31, 2016, all three of our interest rate swaps expired. We did not enter into any new interest rate swaps during the three and nine months ended October 31, 2016. 
    
  The fair value of the potential termination obligations related to our interest rate swaps, which were recorded within the  Fair value of interest rate swap liabilities  caption of our condensed consolidated balance sheets, were as follows: 

(1) 
    These interest rate swaps require a fixed rate of interest in exchange for a variable interest rate based on a   three-month LIBOR  , subject to a   1.25%   floor. 
       
  Until the time of expiration, we determined that the interest rate swap agreements were highly effective in offsetting future variable interest payments associated with the hedged portion of our term loans. During the   nine months ended October 31, 2016  , no ineffectiveness was recorded into current period earnings.  
    
  The effective portion of the unrealized gain recognized in other comprehensive loss for our derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges was the following:

Note 11. Income Taxes 
  The income tax benefit for the three and   nine   months ended   October 31, 2016   and   2015   is based on the estimated effective tax rate for the entire fiscal year. The estimated effective tax rate is subject to adjustment in subsequent quarterly periods as our estimates of pre-tax income and loss for the year fluctuate, including changes in the geographic mix of pre-tax income and loss. 
    
  The effective income tax rates for the three and   nine   months ended   October 31, 2016   were a benefit of   28.7%   and   23.0%  , respectively, compared to a benefit for the three and   nine   months ended   October 31, 2015   of   14.3%   and   16.9%  , respectively. The effective tax rates differ from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to income taxed in foreign jurisdictions, state taxes, non-deductible meals and entertainment expenses, non-deductible goodwill impairment, and discrete items. The difference in effective income tax rates for the three and   nine   months ended   October 31, 2016   and   2015   primarily relates to a change in the estimated forecast of pre-tax book income and loss for each respective jurisdiction, which includes an impairment of non-deductible goodwill recorded during the   nine   months ended   October 31, 2016  . Discrete items related primarily to excess shortfalls associated with the exercise, cancellation, and expiration of stock options, valuation allowance recorded on the state deferred taxes for net operating losses and change in state effective tax rate recorded during the   nine   months ended   October 31, 2016   and impairment of non-deductible goodwill recorded during the three months ended October 31, 2015. 
    
  Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded for deferred income tax assets when management determines it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Our deferred tax assets primarily relate to federal net operating loss carry-forwards. Management believes we will realize the benefit of existing deferred tax assets based on the scheduled reversal of U.S. deferred tax liabilities, related to depreciation and amortization expenses not deductible for tax purposes, which is ordinary income and therefore of the same character as the temporary differences giving rise to the deferred tax assets. This reversal will occur in substantially similar time periods and in the same jurisdictions as the deferred tax assets. As such, the deferred tax liabilities are considered a source of income sufficient to support our U.S. deferred tax assets; therefore, a valuation allowance is not required on   October 31, 2016  . 
    
  We recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Tax benefits recognized from such a position are measured based on whether the benefit has a greater than   50%   likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. We do not believe there will be any material unrecognized tax positions over the next 12 months. 
    
  We believe appropriate provisions for all outstanding issues have been made for all jurisdictions and all open years. However, due to the risk that audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty and as we continue to evaluate such uncertainties in light of current facts and circumstances, our current estimate of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits could increase or decrease for all open tax years. As of the date of this report, we do not anticipate that there will be any material change in the unrecognized tax benefits associated with these audits within the next twelve months.

Note 12. Shareholder s Equity 
    
  Share-Based Compensation 
  During June 2011, BCI Holdings adopted a share-based compensation plan, the BakerCorp International Holdings, Inc. 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2011 Plan ). On September 12, 2013, the BCI Holdings  Board of Directors amended the 2011 Plan by resolution to increase the number of shares of BCI Holdings common stock authorized for issuance under the 2011 Plan to   1,001,339   shares. On   October 31, 2016  , there were   232,670   shares available for grant. The amended 2011 Plan permits the granting of BCI Holdings stock options, nonqualified stock options and restricted stock to eligible employees and non-employee directors and consultants. 
    
  The following table summarizes stock option activity during the   nine months ended October 31, 2016  : 

(1) 
    Aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax value that option holders would have received had all option holders exercised their options on   October 31, 2016  . The aggregate intrinsic value is the difference between the estimated fair market value of the BCI Holdings common stock at the end of the period and the option exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options. This amount will change based on the fair market value of the BCI Holdings common stock. 
       
  As of   October 31, 2016  , there was   $17.1 million   of unrecognized pre-tax share-based compensation expense related to non-vested stock options of which   $0.9 million   we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of   0.7 years  . We expect to recognize the remaining   $16.2 million  , which includes   $8.1 million   of unrecognized share-based compensation expense for the CEO s options, upon a Change in Control or initial public offering ( IPO ) as defined in the 2011 Plan. During the   nine months ended October 31, 2016  , we did not recognize any share-based compensation expense related to the CEO s options.   
  The total fair value of options vested during the three and   nine   months ended   October 31, 2016   is   zero   and   $0.1 million  , respectively. The total fair value of options vested during the three and   nine   months ended   October 31, 2015   is   $0.5 million   and   $1.6 million  , respectively.  
    
  The share-based compensation expense included within employee related expenses in our condensed consolidated statement of operations was the following: 

(1) 
    We remeasured certain options classified as liability awards and recorded decreases to non-cash share-based compensation expense of   $0.0 million   and   $0.7 million   during the three and   nine   months ended   October 31, 2016  , respectively, and decreases to non-cash share-based compensation expense of   $0.3 million   and   $0.8 million   during the three and   nine   months ended   October 31, 2015  , respectively.

The fair value of BCI Holdings stock options issued and classified as equity awards was determined using the Black-Scholes options pricing model utilizing the following weighted-average assumptions for each respective period: 

Liability Awards 
    We account for certain option awards as liability awards, as we determined cash settlement upon exercise is probable. We remeasured the fair value of these options on   October 31, 2016   and decreased our liability to   $0.1 million   from the   $0.7 million   recognized on January 31, 2016. The quarterly re-measurement resulted in a decrease to our non-cash share-based compensation expense of   $0.0 million   and   $0.7 million   during the three and   nine months ended October 31, 2016  , respectively. 
    
  The fair value of BCI Holdings stock options accounted for as liability awards were determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model utilizing the following assumption for each respective period:

  From time to time, we may enter into transactions with related parties. The accounting policies that we apply to our transactions with related parties are consistent with those applied in transactions with independent third parties. 
    
  Pursuant to a professional services agreement between us and Permira Advisers L.L.C. (the  Sponsor ), we agreed to pay the Sponsor an annual management fee of   $0.5 million  , payable quarterly, plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, in connection with the planning, strategy, and oversight support provided to management. We recorded aggregate management fees and expenses to the Sponsor of   $0.1 million   and   $0.1 million   during the three months ended   October 31, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $0.4 million   and   $0.4 million   during the   nine months ended October 31, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 

Note   15  . Commitments and Contingencies 
  Litigation 
  We are involved in various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of conducting our business. These include claims relating to (i) personal injury or property damage involving equipment rented or sold by us, (ii) motor vehicle accidents involving our vehicles and our employees, (iii) employment-related matters, and (iv) environmental matters. We do not believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flow. We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred. 

Note 16. Condensed Consolidating Financial Information 
  Our Notes are guaranteed by all of our U.S. subsidiaries (the  guarantor subsidiaries ). This indebtedness is not guaranteed by BCI Holdings or our foreign subsidiaries (together, the  non-guarantor subsidiaries ). The guarantor subsidiaries are all one hundred percent owned, and the guarantees are made on a joint and several basis and are full and unconditional (subject to subordination provisions and subject to customary release provisions and a standard limitation, which provides that the maximum amount guaranteed by each guarantor will not exceed the maximum amount that may be guaranteed without making the guarantee void under fraudulent conveyance laws). The following condensed consolidating financial information presents the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the parent, guarantors, and non-guarantor subsidiaries of the Company and the eliminations necessary to arrive at the information on a consolidated basis for the periods indicated. The parent referenced in the condensed consolidating financial statements is BakerCorp International, Inc., the issuer. 
  We conduct substantially all of our business through our subsidiaries. To make the required payments on our Notes and other indebtedness, and to satisfy our other liquidity requirements, we will rely, in large part, on cash flows from these subsidiaries, mainly in the form of dividends, royalties, and advances, or the payment of intercompany loan arrangements. The ability of these subsidiaries to make dividend payments to us will be affected by, among other factors, the obligations of these entities to their creditors, requirements of corporate and other law, and restrictions contained in agreements entered into by or relating to these entities. 
  The parent and the guarantor subsidiaries have each reflected investments in their respective subsidiaries under the equity method of accounting. There are no restrictions limiting the transfer of cash from guarantor subsidiaries and non-guarantor subsidiaries to the parent.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  The following discussion and analysis includes historical and forward-looking information that should be read in conjunction with the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report and our consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016. The following tables show our selected condensed consolidated historical financial data for the stated periods. The financial information presented may not be indicative of our future performance. The following discussion and analysis provides information we believe is relevant to assess and understand our condensed consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion includes the following: 

Overview; 
                
    Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates, and Judgments; 
                
    Results of Operations; and 
                
    Liquidity and Capital Resources.  

Overview 
    
  Business 
  We are a provider of liquid and solid containment solutions operating within the specialty sector of the broader industrial services industry. We provide equipment rental, services and sales to our customers through a solution-oriented approach often involving multiple products. We provide our containment solutions within the United States through a national network with the capability to serve customers in all 50 states as well as a growing number of international customers in Europe and Canada. We maintain one of the largest and most diverse liquid and solid containment rental fleets in the industry consisting of more than   25,000   units, including steel tanks, polyethylene tanks, modular tanks, roll-off boxes, pumps, pipes, hoses and fittings, filtration, tank trailers, berms, and trench shoring equipment.  
    
  We serve customers in over   15   industries, including industrial and environmental services, environmental remediation, construction, chemicals, transportation, power, municipal works, and oil and gas. During the   nine months ended October 31, 2016  , no single customer accounted for more than   10%   of our total revenue.  
    
  The demand for our services in the upstream segment of the oil and gas industry, which comprised   8.4%   and   9.0%   of our total revenue for the three and   nine months ended October 31, 2016  , respectively, depends on the continued demand for, and production of, oil and natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and the substantial reductions in crude oil prices that began in October 2014, and continued into 2015 and 2016, have resulted in a decline in the level of drilling and production activity, reducing the demand for fluid containment solutions and water management services in the basins in which we operate. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, we recorded charges totaling $182.8 million associated with the impairment of a portion of our goodwill and other intangible assets within our North American segment as a result of the sustained decline in oil prices, together with the projected market expectations of a slow recovery of such prices, making it more likely than not that the fair value of these assets had decreased below their respective carrying values.  
    
  During the three months ended April 30, 2016, we encountered a reduction in our operating results in comparison to our forecast, primarily due to greater weakness in upstream oil and gas than anticipated, slower rebound in our construction business, and the delay of capital projects by refinery and power plants which can be seen through our lower volume of work with industrial service customers. As a result of the recent decline in demand for our products and services, we re-assessed our revenue and EBITDA forecast beginning with fiscal year 2017 using a bottoms-up approach, having conversations with our key customers, and performing an analysis on current market conditions and industry spending behavior. Based on our assessment, we noted that despite the recent stabilization of oil prices during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, there will be continued uncertainty in the energy market resulting in a slowdown in capital spend. As a result, we updated our projections to reflect the slowdown in activity for the remainder of fiscal year 2017, adjusted our forecast for the outer years to maintain similar growth rates as our previous forecast, and performed the first step of the goodwill impairment test. See Note 6,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Net  of the  Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  for additional details. We recorded non-cash charges totaling   $84.0 million   associated with the impairment of a portion of our goodwill and other intangible assets within the North American segment. Further volatility in oil and natural gas prices and secondary markets could result in the recognition of additional impairment charges on our goodwill, intangible assets and property and equipment associated with our North American operations.

We have the opportunity to capitalize on a number of growth initiatives to increase the breadth of the services we offer and differentiate our capabilities with respect to our people, products and solutions. Certain key elements of our long-term strategy include:  
             
    Commit to safety.   We focus on ensuring a safe and healthy working environment for our employees, customers and communities where we live and work. We execute this through a program called BakerZero. Through this program, we develop and implement policies and procedures to govern and promote workplace safety, including regular management safety reviews, daily branch safety training sessions and a disciplinary action program for incidents that result from non-compliance with our safety programs.  
                
    Increase our Penetration in Key Industries and Evaluate Opportunities for End Market Expansion.   Our low customer concentration, diversity of end markets, and long-standing relationships allow us to capitalize on market and macroeconomic trends while providing a hedge against more volatile industries. 
                
    Maintain Commercial Excellence Through Comprehensive Equipment Rental Solutions.   As the premier global specialty rental company in our market, we have one of the largest branch networks with a broad equipment and service offering. We distinguish ourselves from our competitors and build customer loyalty by leveraging our extensive network to provide integrated and differentiated rental solutions. 
                
    Achieve Operational Excellence by Continuously Developing our Systems and Processes.   We are focused on company-wide process improvements such as cost leverage initiatives, equipment rent ready optimization for the branch network, fleet optimization through our newly developed Asset Management System ( AMS ) and advanced Quality Management System ( QMS ).  
                
    Expand Geographically.   Historically, we have increased penetration in new geographic regions and generated profitable growth by opening new branches within North America and Europe and introducing our products and services. We believe there is an opportunity to continue to open new branches in Europe and in certain under-served regions of North America. 
                
    Retain the Most Talented Employees in the Industry  . Through our best in class training programs and new annual goal-setting and performance management process, we ensure that our workforce is aligned to deliver the highest value to our shareholders, customers, and employees.  
                
    Pursue Selected Acquisitions.   Our markets remain fragmented and have historically presented numerous attractive acquisition candidates. We intend to pursue potential acquisitions that offer complementary products and services or expand our geographic footprint.  
       
  Geographic Operations 
    
  Our branches and employees by reportable segment were the following:  

Our operations are managed from our corporate headquarters, which is located in Plano, Texas. The majority of our operations, resources, property, and equipment are located in North America, and predominantly in the United States. The United States and Canada comprise our North American segment. Our equipment has the capability to be utilized for multiple applications within North America. We incentivize our local managers to maximize return on assets under their control and have provided systems to enable equipment and resource sharing. As a result, equipment in the U.S. and Canada is readily moved and shared by the local branch managers. The process of equipment and resource sharing within our reportable segments enables us to maximize our efficiency and respond to shifts in customer demand.  

38 

     Table of Contents  

We serve customers in our European segment from branches located in the Netherlands, Germany, France and the United Kingdom. Our European operations are headquartered in the Netherlands. Our equipment is transferred between European countries to serve customers as demand dictates.  
    
  Rental Revenue Metrics 
  We evaluate rental revenue, the largest portion of our revenue, utilizing the following metrics:  
             
    Rental Activity     The change in rental activity is measured by the impact of several items, including the utilization of rental equipment that we individually track which reflects the demand for our products in relation to the level of equipment, volume of rental revenue on bulk items not individually tracked (which includes primarily pipes, hoses, fittings, and shoring), and volume of re-rent revenue, resulting from the rental of equipment which we do not own.  
                
    Pricing     The impact of changes in pricing is measured by the increase or decrease in the average daily, weekly or monthly rental rates on rental equipment that we specifically track. 
                
    Available Rental Fleet     The available rental fleet, as we define it, is the average number of equipment items within our fleet that we individually track. 
       
  Seasonality 
  Demand from our customers has historically been higher during the second half of our fiscal year compared to the first half of the year. The peak demand period for our products and services typically occurs during the months of August through November. This peak demand period is driven by certain customers that need to complete maintenance work and other specific projects before the onset of colder weather. Because much of our revenue is derived from storing or moving liquids, the impact of weather may hinder the ability of our customers to fully utilize our equipment. This is particularly the case for customers with project locations in regions that are subject to freezing temperatures during winter.

Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates, and Judgments 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, allowances for doubtful accounts, warranties, inventory valuation, customer rebates, sales returns and allowances, medical insurance claims, litigation accruals, impairment of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill, depreciation, contingencies, income taxes, share-based compensation (expense and liability), and derivatives. We believe our estimates, judgments and assumptions are reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these judgments and estimates, and they may be adjusted as more information becomes available. Any adjustment may be significant. 
    
  An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably may have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur may materially impact the financial statements. We do not believe that there have been any significant changes during the   nine   months ended   October 31, 2016   to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting policies, estimates, and judgments included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  Refer to Note   2  ,  Accounting Pronouncements  of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting guidance. 
    
  Forward-Looking Statements 
  This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our expectations, beliefs, and projections are expressed in good faith, and we believe we have a reasonable basis to make these statements through our management s examination of historical operating trends, data contained in our records, and other data available from third parties, but there can be no assurance that our management s expectations, beliefs, or projections will be achieved. 
    
  The discussions of our financial condition and results of operations may include various forward-looking statements about future costs and prices of commodities, production volumes, industry trends, demand for our products and services, and projected results of operations and our projected capital resources and liquidity. Statements that are not historical in nature are considered to be forward-looking statements. They include statements regarding our expectations, hopes, beliefs, estimates, intentions, or strategies regarding the future. The words  believe,   expect,   anticipate,   intend,   estimate,   will,   look forward to,  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

     Table of Contents  

The forward-looking statements set forth in this quarterly report regarding, among other things, achievement of revenue, profitability and net income in future quarters, future prices and demand for our products and services, estimated fair value for purposes of write-down of goodwill, and estimated cash flows and sufficiency of cash flows to fund capital expenditures, reflect only our expectations regarding these matters. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following. 

Our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our debt obligations. 
                
    Our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business. 
                
    Our business is subject to the general health of the economy, and accordingly any slowdown in the current economy or decrease in general economic activity could materially adversely affect our revenue and operating results. 
                
    Continuing or sustained decline in oil prices and/or natural gas prices at or below current levels could have a negative impact on our operating results. 
                
    Ongoing government review of hydraulic fracturing and its environmental impact could lead to changes to this activity or its substantial curtailment, which could materially adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. 
                
    We intend to expand our business into new geographic markets, and this expansion may be costly and may not be successful. 
                
    Our growth strategy includes evaluating selective acquisitions, which entails certain risks to our business and financial performance. 
                
    We intend to expand into new product lines, which may be costly and may not ultimately be successful. 
                
    We depend on our suppliers for the equipment we rent to customers. 
                
    As our rental equipment ages, we may face increased costs to maintain, repair, and replace that equipment and new equipment could become more expensive. 
                
    The short term nature of our rental arrangements exposes us to redeployment risks and means that we could experience rapid fluctuations in revenue in response to market conditions. 
                
    Our customers may decide to begin providing their own liquid and solid containment solutions rather than sourcing those products from us. 
                
    Our industry is highly competitive, and competitive pressures could lead to a decrease in our market share or in the prices that we may charge. 
                
    We lease all of our branch locations, and accordingly are subject to the risk of substantial changes to the real estate rental markets and our relationships with our landlords. 
                
    Our business is subject to numerous environmental and safety regulations. If we are required to incur significant compliance or remediation costs, our liquidity and operating results could be materially adversely affected. 
                
    Changes in the many laws and regulations to which we are subject in the United States, Europe and Canada, or our failure to comply with them, could materially adversely affect our business. 
                
    We have operations outside the United States. As a result, we may incur losses from currency fluctuations. 
                
    Turnover of our management and our ability to attract and retain other key personnel may affect our ability to efficiently manage our business and execute our strategy. 
                
    If our employees should unionize, this could impact our costs and ability to administer our business. 
                
    We are exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business, and our insurance may not fully cover them. 
                
    Disruptions in our information technology systems could materially adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations and provide effective services to our customers. 
                
    Fluctuations in fuel costs or reduced supplies of fuel could harm our business. 
                
    If we are unable to collect on contracts with customers, our operating results would be materially adversely affected. 
                
    Climate change, climate change regulations, and greenhouse effects may materially adversely impact our operations and markets. 
                
    Existing trucking regulations and changes in trucking regulations may increase our costs and negatively impact our results of operations. 
                
    We may be required to recognize additional impairment charges in the future which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  The following is a reconciliation of our net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as follows: 

(1) 
    We define EBITDA as earnings before deducting interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding certain expenses detailed within the net loss to Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation above. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are used by management to measure performance, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful to investors. EBITDA is commonly utilized in our industry to evaluate operating performance, and Adjusted EBITDA is used to determine our compliance with financial covenants related to our debt instruments and is a key metric used to determine incentive compensation for certain of our employees, including members of our executive management team. Both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are included as a supplemental measure of our operating performance because in the opinion of management they eliminate items that have less bearing on our operating performance and highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on U.S. GAAP financial measures. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is one of the primary measures management uses for the planning and budgeting processes and to monitor and evaluate our operating results. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized items under U.S. GAAP and do not purport to be an alternative to measures of our financial performance as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, such as net loss. Because other companies may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, EBITDA may not be, and Adjusted EBITDA as presented herein is not, comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.  
              (2) 
    Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, as defined by the SEC, we include reconciliations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Results of Operations 
  Three Months Ended   October 31, 2016   Compared to   October 31, 2015    

(1) 
    The average utilization of rental fleet is a measure of efficiency used by management; it represents the percentage of time a unit of equipment is on-rent during a given period. It is not a U.S. GAAP financial measure.  
              (2) 
    The average daily rental rate is used by management to gauge the daily rate of rental equipment that we specifically track during a given period. It is not a U.S. GAAP financial measure.  
              (3) 
    Total operating expenses by reporting segment excludes inter-segment allocations from North America to Europe of   $1.2 million   and   $1.2 million   for the   three months ended October 31, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Revenue 
        
  North America 
  Our North American segment revenue decreased as a result of the decreases in rental and service revenues of   $8.4 million   and   $3.1 million  , respectively. Revenue from oil and gas customers decreased by   $5.2 million  , or   50.1%  . The decline in oil and gas revenue was due to the factors mentioned in the   Overview   section of   Management s Discussion and Analysis  .  
  Revenue, excluding oil and gas customers, decreased by   $6.3 million  , or   10.4%  , primarily due to decreases in revenue related to our maintenance and environmental customers. 
    
  Rental Revenue  
  Rental revenue   decrease  d primarily as a result of a   6.1%     decrease   in average daily rental rate, an   850 basis point     decrease   in average utilization, and a   $1.3 million   decrease in re-rent revenue, partially offset by a   1.2%     increase   in the average number of rental units. In addition to the decrease in revenue from oil and gas, maintenance and environmental customers,   both utilization and rate declines were due to decreased spend at refineries and petrochemical plants, driving demand and pricing down across most product lines. 
    
  Service Revenue  
  Service revenue   decrease  d primarily due to less set-up revenue for pump-related projects and decreased hauling services. 
    
  Europe 
  Revenue from our European segment increased by   $1.3 million  , or   17.0%  , due to increases in revenue from our maintenance and environmental customers. 
    
  Rental Revenue  
  Rental revenue increased by   $1.2 million  , or   17.7%  , primarily due to a   40 basis point   increase in average utilization and a   24.1%   increase in the average number of rental units, partially offset by a   6.1%   decrease in the average daily rate. The increase in the average number of rental units was primarily due to the introduction of the pump and filtration product lines in Europe during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. Utilization increased through continued demand for steel tanks.

     Table of Contents  

Operating Expenses 
    
  North America       
    
  The decrease in operating expenses is primarily attributable to the following: 

$74.2 million   decrease in impairment of goodwill and other intangible asset charges due to no qualitative indicators of further goodwill and other intangible asset impairment during the three months ended October 31, 2016. 
                
    $1.9 million   decrease in employee related expenses primarily due to a $1.6 million decrease in payroll and payroll-related costs, partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in share-based compensation expense. The decrease in payroll and payroll-related costs was primarily driven by a   14.9%   decrease in headcount from   879   as of   October 31, 2015   to   748   as of   October 31, 2016   and corporate cost reduction programs impacting certain employee benefits and overtime spend. The increase in share-based compensation expense was primarily due to$0.3 million related to the stock revaluation which resulted in a reduction of our stock options during the three months ended October 31, 2015 with no additional reductions recorded during the three months ended October 31, 2016. 
                
    $1.6 million   decrease in rental expense primarily due to a $1.5 million decrease in re-rent expense driven by lower re-rent revenue. 
                
    $1.4 million   decrease in other operating expenses primarily due to a $1.0 million decrease in bad debt expense combined with a $0.2 million decrease in travel expense due to cost reduction initiatives and a $0.1 million decrease in relocation expense. The decrease in bad debt expense was primarily related to a specific $1.2 million reserve due to customer bankruptcy proceedings during the same quarter of last year. 
                
    $0.9 million   decrease in facility expense primarily due to a $0.7 million decrease in data processing expense as the result of a $0.6 million contract termination fee charge recorded during the three months ended October 31, 2015.  
                
    $0.4 million   increase in the gain on sale of equipment as a result of higher equipment sales. 
                
    $0.3 million   decrease in depreciation and amortization due to management efforts to dispose of aged equipment requiring significant maintenance costs and various assets becoming fully depreciated. 
                
    $0.3 million   decrease in cost of goods sold driven by the decrease in sales revenue. 
       
  The decrease in operating expenses is partially offset by the following: 
             
    $1.2 million   increase in impairment of long-lived assets from $  $2.7 million   for the same period in the prior year due to their net book values exceeding the estimated fair value. See Note 5,  Property and Equipment, Net.  
       
  Europe 
  The increase in European operating expenses was primarily due to an increase of   $0.4 million   in employee related expenses,   $0.1 million   increase in depreciation and amortization and a $0.1 million increase in various other operating expenses. Employee related expenses increased primarily due to an increase in headcount of   11   employees, or   9.6%  , from   115   employees as of   October 31, 2015   to   126   employees as of   October 31, 2016  .  

Income Tax Benefit 
  Income tax benefit during the three months ended   October 31, 2016   decreased by   $8.6 million   to   $2.6 million   from   $11.2 million   during the three months ended   October 31, 2015  . The tax benefit decrease was primarily due to a decrease in book losses for the three months ended October 31, 2016 offset by impairment of non-deductible goodwill which was a discrete item for the three months ended October 31, 2015.

Revenue 
        
  North America 
  Our North American segment revenue decreased as a result of decreases in rental, sales and service revenue of   $31.9 million  ,   $0.7 million   and   $10.6 million  , respectively. Revenue from oil and gas customers decreased by   $19.6 million  , or   54.5%  , during the   nine   months ended   October 31, 2016   compared to the same period in the prior year. The decline in oil and gas revenue was due to the factors mentioned in the   Overview   section of   Management s Discussion and Analysis  .  
  Revenue, excluding oil and gas customers, decreased by   $23.7 million  , or   13.5%  , primarily due to a decrease in revenue related to our maintenance, environmental, construction and mining customers. 
    
  Rental Revenue  
  Rental revenue decreased primarily as a result of a   5.7%   decrease in average daily rental rate, a   2.2%   decrease in the average number of rental units,   980 basis point   decrease in average utilization, and a   $3.7 million   decrease in re-rent revenue. The average number of rental units decreased primarily due to management efforts to dispose of aged equipment requiring significant maintenance costs. In addition to the decrease in revenue from oil and gas, maintenance, environmental, construction and mining customers,   both utilization and rate declines were due to decreased capital spend at refineries and petrochemical plants, driving demand and pricing down across most product lines. 
    
  Sales Revenue  
  Sales revenue decreased as a result of decreases in special media, pumps, and bulk equipment sales. 
    
  Service Revenue  
  Service revenue   decrease  d primarily due to less set-up revenue for pump-related projects and decreased hauling services. 
    
  Europe 
  Total revenue from our European segment increased by   $4.4 million  , or   18.6%  , primarily due to increases in maintenance and environmental customers. 
    
  Rental Revenue  
  Rental revenue increased by   $4.2 million  , or   19.3%  , primarily due to a   18.0%   increase in the average number of rental units and a   400 basis point   increase in average utilization, partially offset by a   3.6%   decrease in average daily rate. The increase in the average number of rental units and utilization is primarily due to the introduction of the pump and filtration product lines in Europe during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. 
    
  Operating Expenses 
    
  North America 
  The decrease in operating expenses is primarily attributable to the following: 
             
    $10.9 million   decrease in employee related expenses primarily due to a $7.4 million decrease in payroll and payroll-related costs, a $1.6 million decrease in insurance costs, a $0.7 million decrease in bonus expense, a $0.6 million decrease in temporary labor costs, and a $0.4 million decrease in severance expense. The decrease in payroll and payroll-related costs was driven primarily by the impact of corporate cost reduction programs which affected certain employee benefits and overtime spend and a decrease in average headcount of   130   employees, or   14.1%  , from   920   employees during the   nine   months ended   October 31, 2015   to   790   employees during the   nine   months ended   October 31, 2016  .  The decrease in insurance expense was driven by lower costs during the nine months ended   October 31, 2016   due to a change from self-insured to fully-insured health plans on July 1, 2014. We reverted to a self-insured employee medical program effective July 1, 2015. The decrease in bonus expense was the result of our operating results being less than planned. The decrease in temporary labor costs was primarily due to less project staffing requirements as a result of corporate cost reduction programs. The decrease in severance costs was due to the termination of certain positions in the prior year. 
     
   49 

     Table of Contents  

$7.9 million   decrease in rental expense was primarily due to a $5.9 million decrease in re-rent expense driven by lower re-rent revenue, a $1.6 million decrease in fuel expenses, a $0.3 million decrease in the use of outside freight vendors, and a $0.2 million decrease in the rental equipment for branch use. 
                
    $3.0 million   decrease in depreciation and amortization as we impaired certain aged equipment with limited utilization in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 coupled with management efforts to dispose of aged equipment requiring significant maintenance costs and various assets becoming fully depreciated. 
                
    $2.3 million   decrease in other operating expenses primarily due to decreases of $1.1 million in bad debt expense and $0.4 million in travel expense and $0.3 million in customer entertainment costs due to corporate cost containment initiatives. 
                
    $1.5 million   decrease in facility expense due to reductions in data processing, property tax, and miscellaneous office expenses. 
                
    $0.9 million   increase in the gain on sale of equipment as a result of higher equipment sales. 
                
    $0.7 million   decrease in repair and maintenance expenses primarily due to the reversal of a regulatory liability that is no longer required at the level we initially anticipated. 
       
  The decrease in operating expenses is partially offset by the following: 
             
    $9.8 million   of goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges recorded during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. See Note 6,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Net  of the  Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
                
    $1.2 million   increase in impairment of long-lived assets due to their net book values exceeding the estimated fair value. See Note 5,  Property and Equipment, Net.  
       
  Europe 
  Operating expenses for the European segment during the   nine   months ended   October 31, 2016   were   $17.9 million  , an increase of   $1.5 million  , or   8.9%  , compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in European operating expenses was primarily due to increases of   $0.9 million  ,   $0.3 million  , and   $0.3 million   in employee related expenses, professional fees, and depreciation and amortization, respectively. Employee related expenses increased primarily due to a   $0.5 million   increase in payroll and payroll-related costs and a   $0.4 million   increase in bonus expense. The increase in payroll and payroll-related costs was driven by an increase in average headcount of   12   employees, or   10.7%  , from   112   employees during the   nine   months   October 31, 2015   to   124   employees during the   nine   months ended   October 31, 2016  . The increase in bonus expense was due to our improved operating results. Professional fees increased primarily due to higher legal and accounting costs. Depreciation and amortization increased due to an increase in capital expenditures. 
    
  Income Tax Benefit 
    Income tax benefit during the   nine   months ended   October 31, 2016   increased by   $10.9 million   primarily due to an increase in book losses during the nine months ended October 31, 2016, partially offset by an impairment of non-deductible goodwill recorded during the   nine   months ended October 31, 2015 as a discrete adjustment.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Liquidity Summary 
  We have a history of generating higher cash flow from operations than net income recorded during the same period. The cash flow to fund our business has historically been generated from operations. We utilize this cash flow to invest in property and equipment that are core to our business and to reduce debt. We invest in assets that have relatively long useful lives. The Internal Revenue Code allows us to accelerate the depreciation of these assets for tax purposes over a much shorter period allowing us to defer the payment of income taxes.  
    
  Cash and cash equivalents by geography were the following as of: 

Our cash held outside the United States may be repatriated to the United States but, under current law, may be subject to United States federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. We do not plan to repatriate cash balances from our foreign subsidiaries to fund our operations within the United States. We have not provided for the United States federal tax liability on these amounts as this cash is considered permanently reinvested outside of the United States. We utilize a variety of cash planning strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. Our intent is to meet our domestic liquidity needs through ongoing cash flow, external borrowings, or both.  
    
  Our business requires ongoing investment in equipment to maintain the size of our rental fleet. Most of our assets, if properly maintained, may generate a level of revenue similar to new assets of the same type over the assets  useful lives. There is not a well-defined secondary or resale market for the majority of our assets; therefore, we rent our assets for as long as they may safely be employed to meet our customers  needs. We invest capital in additional equipment with the expectation of generating revenue on that investment within a relatively short period of time. 
    
  We invest in new equipment for several reasons, including:  
             
    to expand our current product lines within markets where we already operate;  
                
    to enter new geographic regions;  
                
    to add additional product offerings in response to customer or market demands; and  
                
    to replace equipment that has been retired because it is no longer functional.  
       
  We have not made long-term commitments to purchase equipment. Additionally, the period of time between when we place an order for equipment and when we begin to receive it is typically two to four months. This ordering process enables us to quickly reduce our capital spending during periods of economic slowdown. During periods of expansion, we fund our investments in equipment utilizing our cash flow from operations or borrowings. Management believes our cash flow from operations and our Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our current operating needs and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.  
    
  We may use funds to repurchase our outstanding indebtedness from time to time, including outstanding indebtedness under our Credit Facility and Notes. Repurchases may be made in the open market, or through privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, at prices and on terms we deem appropriate and subject to our cash requirements for other purposes, compliance with the covenants under our debt agreements, and other factors management deems relevant.

Debt 
  On June 1, 2011, we (i) entered into a   $435.0 million   senior secured credit facility (the  Credit Facility ), consisting of a   $390.0 million   term loan facility (the  Senior Term Loan ) and a   $45.0 million   revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Credit Facility ) (  $45.0 million   available on   October 31, 2016   and, as described below, the revolving credit facility was reduced to $40.0 million on November 3, 2016) and (ii) issued   $240.0 million   in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2019 (the  Notes ). (Refer to Note   9  ,  Debt  of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further details.) 
    
  Credit Facility 
    
  On February 7, 2013, we entered into a first amendment to refinance our Credit Facility (the  First Amendment ). Pursuant to the First Amendment, we borrowed   $384.2 million   of term loans (the  Amended Senior Term Loan ) to refinance a like amount of term loans (the  Original Term Loan ) under the Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin, subject to a LIBOR floor of   1.25%  . The LIBOR margin applicable to the Amended Senior Term Loan is   3.00%  , which is   0.75%   less than the LIBOR margin applicable to the Original Term Loan. In addition, (i) the Senior Term Loan maturity date was extended to February 7, 2020, provided that the maturity will be March 2, 2019 if the Amended Senior Term Loan is not repaid or refinanced on or prior to March 2, 2019, (ii) the Revolving Credit Facility maturity date was extended to February 7, 2018, and (iii) we obtained increased flexibility with respect to certain covenants and restrictions relating to the Company s ability to incur additional debt, make investments, debt prepayments, and acquisitions. Principal on the Senior Term Loan is payable in quarterly installments of   $1.0 million  . Furthermore, the excess cash flow prepayment requirement is in effect until the maturity date. 
  On November 13, 2013, we entered into a second amendment to the Credit Facility (the  Second Amendment ). Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Company borrowed   $35.0 million   of incremental term loans (the  Incremental Term Loan ), which may be used for general corporate purposes, including to finance permitted acquisitions. The terms applicable to the Incremental Term Loan are the same as those applicable to the term loans under the Credit Facility. 
  The Credit Facility, as amended, places certain limitations on our (and all of our U.S. subsidiaries ) ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other distributions, repurchase capital stock, make certain investments, enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates, utilize assets as security in other transactions, and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies.  
  Under the Credit Facility, we may be required to satisfy and maintain a total leverage ratio not in excess of the leverage ratio 6.00:1.00 if there is an outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility of   25%   or more of the committed amount on any quarter end. The total leverage ratio is calculated as our net debt (total debt less cash and cash equivalents) divided by our trailing twelve months  adjusted EBITDA. On   October 31, 2016  , we did not have an outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility; therefore, on   October 31, 2016  , we were not subject to a leverage test. Additionally, on   October 31, 2016  , we were in compliance with all of our requirements and covenant tests under the Credit Facility. 
  The Credit Facility, as amended, places certain restrictive covenants (in each case, subject to exclusions) that limit, among other things, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: (1) create, incur, assume, or permit to exist, any liens; (2) create, incur, assume, or permit to exist, directly or indirectly, any additional indebtedness; (3) consolidate, merge, amalgamate, liquidate, wind up, or dissolve themselves; (4) convey, sell, lease, license, assign, transfer, or otherwise dispose of assets; (5) make certain restricted payments; (6) make certain investments; (7) make any optional prepayment, repayment, or redemption with respect to, or amend or otherwise alter the terms of documents related to, certain subordinated indebtedness; (8) enter into sale leaseback transactions; (9) enter into transactions with affiliates; (10) change our fiscal year end date or the method of determining fiscal quarters; (11) enter into contracts that limit our ability to incur any lien to secure our obligations under the Credit Facility; (12) create any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any restricted subsidiary to make certain distributions; and (13) engage in certain lines of business. The Credit Facility also contains other customary restrictive covenants. The covenants are subject to various baskets and materiality thresholds.  
  On November 3, 2016, we entered into a third amendment to our Credit Facility (the  Third Amendment ) to amend the Revolving Credit Facility. The amendment (i) extends our maturity date from   February 7, 2018   to   November 7, 2019   (provided that such maturity date will be accelerated to   January 30, 2019   unless the Company s senior notes are repaid in full or extended or refinanced on or prior to January 30, 2019) and (ii) reduces the revolver commitment from   $45.0 million   to   $40.0 million   in addition to certain other amendments to the original terms. Under the amended Credit Facility, we may be required to satisfy and maintain a total leverage ratio if there is an outstanding balance on the revolving loan of   28%   or more of the committed amount on any quarter end. 
  The Third Amendment is accounted for as debt modification. Costs incurred in connection with the Third Amendment will be deferred and amortized over the term of the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, any unamortized deferred costs  
  
   52 

     Table of Contents  

related to the old arrangement will be written off in proportion to the decrease in borrowing capacity. As of October 31, 2016, we incurred and recorded   $0.2 million   to deferred costs related to the Third Amendment. 
  Costs related to debt financing are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt instruments utilizing the straight-line method for our revolving credit facility and the effective interest method for our senior term and incremental term loan facilities. We amortized   $0.8 million   and   $0.6 million   of deferred financing costs during each period in the   three months ended October 31, 2016   and   2015  , and   $2.2 million   and   $2.0 million   during each period in the   nine months ended October 31, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Senior Unsecured Notes due 2019 
  On June 1, 2011, we issued   $240.0 million   of fixed rate   8.25%   senior unsecured notes due June 1, 2019 (the  Notes ). We may redeem all or any portion of the Notes at the redemption prices set forth in the applicable indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Upon a change of control, we are required to make an offer to redeem all of the Notes from the holders at a redemption price equal to   101%   of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of the repurchase. The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by our direct and indirect existing and future wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries. 
    
  Interest and Fees 
  Interest and fees related to our Credit Facility and the Notes were as follows:  

(1) 
    Interest on the Amended Term Loan is payable quarterly based upon an interest rate of   4.25%  . 
              (2) 
    Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually based upon a fixed annual rate of   8.25%  . 
       
  Principal Payments on Debt 
  As of   October 31, 2016  , minimum required principal payments related to the Credit Facility and the Notes for each of the fiscal years ending January 31 are as follows:

Sources and Uses of Cash 
  Our sources and uses of cash for selected line items in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows were as follows: 

Cash Provided by Operating Activities  
  Cash flow from operations during the   nine months ended October 31, 2016   totaled   $25.4 million  , a decrease of   $16.0 million   compared to the   nine months ended October 31, 2015  . This decrease was primarily related to the following:  
              
    The change in share-based compensation expense resulted in a   $0.2 million   decrease, primarily due to the remeasurement of our stock options accounted for as liability awards. 
                
    The change in gain on sale of equipment resulted in a   $0.8 million   decrease due to higher sales of equipment in the current fiscal period. 
                
    The change in depreciation and amortization resulted in a   $2.7 million   decrease, primarily due to the disposition of aged equipment requiring significant maintenance costs and the impairment of long-lived assets in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. 
                
    The change in deferred income taxes resulted in a   $13.7 million   decrease to cash provided by   operating activities. 
                
    The change in prepaid expenses and other assets resulted in a   $1.0 million   decrease, primarily due to a decrease in miscellaneous vendor credits in the current year and an increase in the payment of software support subscriptions, partially offset by higher prepaid insurance in the prior year. 
     The decreases above are partially offset by the following: 
             
    The impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets resulted in a   $9.8 million   increase.  
                
    The change in accounts receivable resulted in a   $0.5 million   increase to cash provided by operating activities primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable due to higher sales during the prior fiscal period.  
     
   54 

     Table of Contents  

The change in inventories resulted in a   $4.5 million   increase to   cash provided by operating activities due to the completion and transfer of assembled equipment to our rental fleet. 
                
    The change in accounts payable and other liabilities resulted in a   $0.4 million   increa  se to cash provided by operating activities primarily due to cost saving initiatives implemented in the current year  .  

Cash Used In Investing Activities  
  Cash used in investing activities consists of cash used to purchase property and equipment, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of equipment from our rental fleet. Purchases of property and equipment totaled   $29.8 million   and   $18.4 million   during the   nine months ended October 31, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Proceeds from equipment sales totaled   $3.8 million   and   $2.9 million   during the   nine months ended October 31, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The increase in capital expenditures was to support new projects and refurbish our existing fleet.  
    
  Effect of Exchange Rate Changes on Cash  
  The effect of foreign currency translation on cash resulted in an increase of   $0.6 million   and a decrease of   $0.2 million   to cash and cash equivalents during the   nine months ended October 31, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The Euro/USD, the British Pound Sterling/USD and Canadian dollar/USD spot rates changed from 1.102, 1.534, and 0.759, respectively, as of   October 31, 2015   to 1.098, 1.219, and 0.746, respectively, as of   October 31, 2016  . 
    
  Hedging Activities 
  From time to time, we may use interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert a portion of our debt with variable interest rates into a fixed interest rate obligation. Under our interest rate swap agreements, we typically agree to pay the counterparty a fixed interest rate in exchange for receiving interest payments based on an interest rate that will vary similarly to the rate on the debt that we are attempting to hedge. We have historically conducted our swaps with large well-capitalized counterparties whom we determined to be creditworthy.  
       
  We document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions, the forecasted transaction that has been designated as the hedged item, and how the hedging instrument is expected to reduce the risks related to the hedged item. We analyze our interest rate swaps quarterly to determine if the hedged transaction remains effective or ineffective. We may discontinue hedge accounting for interest rate swaps prospectively if certain criteria are no longer met, the interest rate swap is terminated or exercised, or if we elect to remove the cash flow hedge designation. If hedge accounting is discontinued and the forecasted hedged transaction remains probable of occurring, the previously recognized gain or loss on the interest rate swaps will remain in accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be reclassified into earnings during the same period the forecasted hedged transaction affects earnings. Our determination of the fair value of our interest rate swaps was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the swap contracts and the observable interest rate curve. We adjust a liability on our balance sheet when the market value of the interest rate swap is different from our basis in the interest rate swap agreements. When an interest rate swap agreement qualifies for hedge accounting under generally accepted accounting principles, we record a charge or credit to other comprehensive loss. When an interest rate swap agreement has not been designated as a hedge, or does not meet all of the criteria to be classified as a hedge, we record a net unrealized gain or loss within our condensed consolidated statements of operations.  
    
  As of July 31, 2016, our three swap agreements, with a total notional amount of $214.0 million, expired. No unrealized gain or loss was recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the interest rate swap agreements. We did not enter into any new interest rate swap agreements during the three and nine months ended   October 31, 2016  . We are always evaluating the interest rate risk exposure and could enter into agreements to manage our risk. 
    
  Contractual Obligations 
  There has been no material change to our contractual obligations as disclosed in our 2016 Annual Report. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
         As of   October 31, 2016  , we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
    
  Interest Rates 
  From time to time, we may use interest rate swaps, collars or options to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. As of July 31, 2016, we no longer had any outstanding interest rate swaps. As of October 31, 2016, our total indebtedness was   $643.8 million   (including   $240.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   8.25%   senior notes due 2019 and   $403.8 million   aggregate principal amount outstanding of LIBOR term loans (subject to a   1.25%   floor) under our term loan facility). A 100 basis point increase or decrease in the assumed interest rates on the credit facilities would result in a $4.9 million increase or decrease in reported net loss for the   nine months ended October 31, 2016  .  
  See Note 8,  Fair Value Measurements,  for details of methodology and inputs used to determine the fair value of our debt. Generally, the fair value of debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. These changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt do not alter our obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount or any related interest of such debt. 
    
  Impact of Foreign Currency Rate Changes 
  We currently have branch operations outside the United States, and our foreign subsidiaries conduct their business in local currency. Our operations in Canada are denominated in the Canadian dollar, operations in the Netherlands, Germany and France are denominated in the Euro, and operations in the United Kingdom are denominated in the British Pound Sterling. Likewise, we pay our expenses in the local currencies, described above, in the areas in which we operate. We are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of our non-United States operations are translated into U.S. dollars. Based upon the financial results of our international operations during the period relative to the Company as a whole, a 10% change in the exchange rates would not have a material impact on our after-tax earnings. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  The Company under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer (its principal executive officer) and the Chief Financial Officer (its principal financial officer), evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   October 31, 2016  .  
    Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended   October 31, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
    
  The information set forth above under Note   15  ,  Commitments and Contingencies   Litigation,  contained in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements is incorporated herein by reference. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
    
  The reader should carefully consider, in connection with the other information in this report, the factors discussed in Part I,  Item 1A: Risk Factors  of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016. These factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in forward-looking statements or otherwise contained in this document and elsewhere. Except as described below, there have been no material changes from our risk factors as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016. 
    
  The affirmative vote in the United Kingdom ( UK ) to withdraw from the European Union ( EU ) may adversely affect our business. 
    
  On June 23, 2016, the UK held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the EU, commonly referred to as  Brexit.  As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the British government will begin negotiating the terms of the UK s future relationship with the EU. The Brexit vote may result in regulatory uncertainty throughout the region and could adversely affect business activity, political stability and economic conditions throughout Europe. The uncertainty concerning the timing and terms of the exit could also have a negative impact on the growth of the UK and/or EU economies and cause the strengthening of the US dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The strengthening of the US dollar relative to the British pound and euro may adversely affect our results of operations as we translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into US dollars for our financial statements. During periods of strengthening dollar, our reported international sales and earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer US dollars.  
    
  Variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly. 
    
  Certain of our borrowings, primarily borrowings under our credit facilities, are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. As such, our net income is sensitive to movements in interest rates. There are many economic factors outside our control that have in the past, and may in the future, impact rates of interest, including publicly announced indices that underlie the interest obligations to a certain portion of our debt. Factors that impact interest rates include governmental monetary policies, inflation, recession, changes in unemployment, the money supply, international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets. Such increases in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  As of July 31, 2016, we no longer had any outstanding interest rate swaps. In the future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.
