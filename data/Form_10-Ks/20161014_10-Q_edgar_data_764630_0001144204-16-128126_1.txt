1 .    Description
                                         of Business and Basis of Presentation   

United States
Basketball League, Inc. ( USBL ) was incorporated in Delaware on May 29, 1984 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Meiseheimer
Capital, Inc. ( MCI ) for the purpose of developing and managing a professional basketball league, the United States
Basketball League (the  League ). Since the inception of the League, USBL has been primarily engaged in selling franchises
and managing the League. From 1985 and up to the present time, USBL has sold a total of approximately forty active franchises
(teams), a vast majority of which were terminated for non-payment of their respective franchise obligations. The 2008, 2009, 2010,
2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 seasons have been cancelled. At the present time, USBL does not have any definitive plans
as to the scheduling of a new season. USBL is currently in the process of exploring certain strategic alternatives, including
the possible sale of the League. 

On October 30, 2014, USBL dissolved
its wholly-owned subsidiary, Meisenheimer Capital Real Estate Holdings, Inc. ( MCREH ). MCREH owned a commercial building
in Milford, Connecticut until June 19, 2014. 

At August 31, 2016, USBL had
negative working capital of $2,231,882, and accumulated losses of $4,915,865. These factors, as well as the Company s reliance
on related parties (see Notes 3 and 4), raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The Company is making efforts
to raise equity capital, revitalize the league and market new franchises. However, there can be no assurance that the Company
will be successful in accomplishing its objectives. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The accompanying unaudited financial
statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Accordingly, they may not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited financial statements reflect
all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation. Operating results for the
six-month period ended August 31, 2016 may not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending
February 29, 2017. The notes to the financial statements should be read in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial
statements contained in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2016. 

2 .    Summary
                                         of Significant Accounting Policies   

Fair value disclosures
    The carrying amounts of the Company s financial instruments, which consist of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts payable and accrued expenses, credit card obligations, and due to related parties, approximate their fair value due to
their short term nature or based upon values of comparable instruments. 

Cash and cash equivalents
-   The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. 

Revenue recognition -
  The Company generally uses the accrual method of accounting in these financial statements. However, due to the uncertainty
of collecting royalty and franchise fees from the franchisees, USBL recorded these revenues upon receipt of cash consideration
paid or the performance of related services by the franchisee. Franchise fees earned in nonmonetary transactions were recorded
at the fair value of the franchise granted or the service received, based on which value was more readily determinable. Upon the
granting of the franchise, the Company had performed essentially all material conditions related to the sale. 

Income taxes   -
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to
reverse. A valuation allowance has been fully provided for the deferred tax asset (approximately $1,015,000 at February 29, 2016)
attributable to the USBL net operating loss carryforward. 

As of February 29, 2016, USBL
had a net operating loss carryforward of approximately $2,900,000 available to offset future taxable income. The carryforward
expires in varying amounts from 2019 to 2035. Current United States income tax laws limit the amount of loss available to offset
against future taxable income when a substantial change in ownership occurs. Therefore, the amount available to offset future
taxable income may be limited. 

USBL files Federal and Connecticut
income tax returns using a December 31 fiscal year. The last returns were filed for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Estimates    
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. 

Stock-based compensation
    Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC )
718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation.  No stock options were granted during 2016 and 2015 and none are outstanding
at August 31, 2016. 

Earnings
(loss) per share     ASC 260,  Earnings Per Share , establishes standards
for computing and presenting earnings (loss) per share (EPS). ASC 260 requires dual presentation of basic and diluted EPS. Basic
EPS excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options or convertible
securities were exercised or converted into common stock. The Company did not include the 1,105,679 shares of convertible preferred
stock in its calculation of diluted loss per share for the three and six months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 as the result would
have been antidilutive.  

Comprehensive income  
  Other comprehensive income (loss) refers to revenues, expenses, gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting
principles are included in comprehensive income but are excluded from net income (loss) as these amounts are recorded directly
as an adjustment to stockholders  deficiency. Comprehensive income (loss) was equivalent to net income (loss) for all periods
presented.

                                         Payable and Accrued Expenses

rent incurred to Genvest, LLC (an entity controlled by the two officers of USBL) totaling $3,000, $3,000, $6,000, and $6,000,
respectively.

Occupancy
Agreement  

In September
2007, the Company moved its office to a building owned by Genvest LLC, an organization controlled by the two officers of USBL.
Improvements to the Company s space there were completed in February 2008. Pursuant to a verbal agreement, the Company is
to pay Genvest monthly rentals of $1,000 commencing March 2008. At August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016, accounts payable and
accrued expenses included accrued rent payable to Genvest totaling $102,000 and $96,000, respectively. 

Litigation  

On June
30, 2008, a legal action was commenced by Albany Patroons, Inc., a franchisee of USBL, against the Company in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of New York. The complaint alleged breach of contract by USBL due to the suspension of
the 2008 season and sought total damages of $285,000. On September 5, 2008, the Company answered the complaint and asserted a
counter-claim against plaintiff for breach of franchise agreement and/or memorandum of agreement. This action was discontinued
and the parties agreed to proceed with binding arbitration. To date, plaintiff has not proceeded with binding arbitration. The
Company believes that it has a meritorious defense to the action and does not expect the ultimate resolution of this matter to
have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. 

Item
                          2.      Management s
                                         Discussion and Analysis of financial condition and results of operations.   

OVERVIEW 

It is anticipated that the Company will
continue to operate at a loss for the next twelve months. The Company anticipates continue reliance on financial assistance from
affiliates. Given the current lack of capital, the Company has not been able to develop any new programs to revitalize the League,
nor has it been able to hire sales and promotional personnel or schedule a season. As a result, the Company is currently dependent
on the efforts of Daniel Meisenheimer, III and one other employee for all marketing efforts. Their efforts have not resulted in
any franchises. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Revenue Recognition 

The Company generally uses the accrual
method of accounting. However, due to the uncertainty of collecting royalty and franchise fees from the franchisees, USBL recorded
these revenues upon receipt of cash consideration paid or the performance of related services by the franchisee. Franchise fees
earned in nonmonetary transactions were recorded at the fair value of the franchise granted or the service received, based on
which value was more readily determinable. Upon the granting of the franchise, the Company had performed essentially all material
conditions related to the sale. 

THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2016 AS
COMPARED TO AUGUST 31, 2015 

For the three months
ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no franchise fees or advertising revenues as a result of the cancellation of its
seasons from 2008 through 2016. 

Operating expenses
decreased $19,348 from $34,619 for the three months ended August 31, 2015 to $15,271 for the three months ended August 31, 2016.
The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to lower professional fees ($16,862) in 2016 as compared to 2015. The February
29, 2016 Form 10-K was filed on April 7, 2016 whereas the February 28, 2015 Form 10-K was filed on June 11, 2015. 

Other expenses, net,
was $330 for the three months ended August 31, 2016 as compared to $881 for the three months ended August 31, 2015. 

Net loss for the three
months ended August 31, 2016 was $15,601 as compared to net loss of $44,891 for the three months ended August 31, 2015. The $29,290
decrease in net loss was due to the $19,348 decrease in operating expenses, the $551 decrease in other expenses, net, and the
$9,391 decrease in income taxes. 

SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2016 AS COMPARED
TO AUGUST 31, 2015 

For the six months
ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no franchise fees or advertising revenues as a result of the cancellation of its
seasons from 2008 through 2016. 

Operating expenses
decreased $3,345 from $41,408 for the six months ended August 31, 2015 to $38,063 for the six months ended August 31, 2016. The
decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to the $4,005 decrease in professional fees. 

Other expenses, net,
was $640 in 2016 compared to $1,211 in 2015. 

Net loss for the six
months ended August 31, 2016 was $38,703 as compared to net loss of $52,010 for the six months ended August 31, 2015. The $13,307
decrease in net loss was due to the $3,345 decrease in operating expenses, the $571 decrease in other expenses, net, and the $9,391
decrease in income taxes. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

The Company had cash
and cash equivalents of $289 and a working capital deficit of $2,231,882 at August 31, 2016. The Company's statement of cash flows
for the six months ended August 31, 2016 reflects cash used in operating activities of $28,043, which results primarily from the
$38,703 net loss offset by the $9,794 increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses. Net cash provided by financing activities
was $27,916 in 2016 compared to $25,722 in 2015. 

The Company expects
it will continue to have to rely on affiliates for loans and revenues to assist it in meeting its current obligations. With respect
to long term needs, the Company recognizes that in order for USBL and the League to be successful, USBL has to develop a meaningful
sales and promotional program. This will require an investment of additional capital. Given the Company s current financial
condition, the Company s ability to raise additional capital other than from affiliates is questionable. At the current
time, the Company has no definitive plan as to how to raise additional capital and schedule a 2017 season.
