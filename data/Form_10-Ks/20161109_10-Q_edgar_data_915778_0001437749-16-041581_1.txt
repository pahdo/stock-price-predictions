   NOTE A BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
     
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the nine months ended September   30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. For further information, reference is made to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of DSP Group, Inc. (the  Company ) for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
     
   NOTE B INVENTORIES   
     
  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. The Company periodically evaluates the quantities on hand relative to current and historical selling prices, and historical and projected sales volume. Based on these evaluations, provisions are made in each period to write inventory down to its net realizable value. Inventories are composed of the following:  

Inventory write-off amounted to $101 and $384 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

NOTE C NET   EARNINGS   PER SHARE   
     
  Basic net earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. For the same periods, diluted net earnings per share further includes the effect of dilutive stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted share units outstanding during the period, all in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) No. 260  Earnings per Share.  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net earnings per share:  

NOTE D MARKETABLE SECURITIES and time deposits   
     
  The Company accounts for investments in marketable securities in accordance with FASB ASC No.320-10  Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.  Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in government and corporate marketable debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determinations at each balance sheet date.  
     
  The Company classifies marketable securities as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in other comprehensive income. The amortized cost of marketable securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization and interest are included in financial income, net. Interest and dividends on securities are included in financial income, net. The following is a summary of available-for-sale securities at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

12

The   amortized cost of marketable debt securities and short-term deposits at September   30, 2016, by contractual maturities, is shown below  :  

The actual   maturity dates may differ   from the contractual maturities because debtors may have the right to call or prepay obligations without penalties.  
     
  Management believes that as of September 30, 2016, the unrealized losses in the Company s investments in all types of marketable securities were temporary and no impairment loss was realized in the Company s condensed consolidated statement of income.  
   
  The unrealized losses related to all types of marketable securities were primarily due to changes in interest rates. Because the Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at September 30, 2016.  
   
  The total fair value of marketable securities with outstanding unrealized losses as of September 30, 2016 amounted to $67,430, while the unrealized losses for these marketable securities amounted to $310. Of the $310 unrealized losses outstanding as of September 30, 2016, a portion of which in the amount of $99 related to marketable securities that were in a loss position for more than 12 months and the remaining portion in the amount of $211 was related to marketable securities that were in a loss position for less than 12 months.  
     
  Proceeds from maturity of available-for-sale marketable securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $34,265 and $14,157, respectively. Proceeds from sales of available-for-sale marketable securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $13,072 and $11,492, respectively. Net realized loss from the sale of available-for-sale securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $17 compared to net realized loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $26. The Company determines realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities based on a specific identification method.  
     
  Marketable securities are periodically reviewed for impairment. If management concludes that any marketable security is impaired, management determines whether such impairment is other-than-temporary. Factors considered in making such a determination include the duration and severity of the impairment, the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period, and the Company s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the marketable security before recovery of cost basis. If any impairment is considered other-than-temporary, the marketable security is written down to its fair value through a corresponding charge to financial income, net.

NOTE e TAXES ON Income   
     
  The effective tax rate used in computing the provision for income taxes is based on projected fiscal year income before taxes, including estimated income by tax jurisdiction.  
     
  The total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits was $947 and $1,711 at September   30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company accrues interest and penalties, relating to unrecognized tax benefits, in its provision for income taxes. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had accrued interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits of $40 and $180, respectively  . The decrease in the total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits was primarily due to a tax payment made during the third quarter of 2016 as a result of the finalization of a tax audit of one of the Company s subsidiaries.   
     
  The Company intends to permanently reinvest earnings of its foreign operations and its current operating plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate foreign earnings to fund the Company s U.S. operations. However, if these funds were needed for the Company s operations or other corporate activities in the United States, the Company would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes as well as taxes in other countries to repatriate these funds. The determination of the amount of additional taxes related to the repatriation of these earnings is not practicable, as it may vary based on various factors such as the location of the cash and the effect of regulation in the various jurisdictions from which the cash would be repatriated.  
     
   NOTE f   SIGNIFICANT   CUSTOMERS   
     
  The Company sells its products primarily through distributors and directly to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and original design manufacturers (ODMs) who incorporate the Company s products into consumer products. The Company s future performance will depend, in part, on the continued success of its distributors in marketing and selling its products. The loss of the Company s distributors and the Company s inability to obtain satisfactory replacements in a timely manner may harm the Company s sales and results of operations. In addition, the Company expects that a limited number of customers, varying in identity from period-to-period, will account for a substantial portion of its revenues in any period. The loss of, or reduced demand for products from, any of the Company s major customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations.  
     
  Sales to VTech Holdings Ltd. ( VTech ) represented 26% and 32% of the Company s total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales to VTech represented 29% and 30% of the Company s total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
  Sales to Guo Wei Electronics Ltd. ( Guo Wei Electronics ) represented 10% and 11% of the Company s total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales to Guo Wei Electronics represented 8% and 11% of the Company s total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
  Sales to Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd ( Samsung ) represented 12% and 0% of the Company s total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 13% and 0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
  Revenues derived from sales through the Company s distributor, Ascend Technology Inc., ( Ascend Technology ), accounted for 16% and 13% of the Company s total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Revenues derived from sales through Ascend Technology accounted for 16% of the Company s total revenues for both nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   

14

Revenues derived from sales through the Company s distributor, Tomen Electronics Corporation ( Tomen Electronics ), accounted for 14% and 18% of the Company s total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 12% and 17% of the Company s total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Tomen Electronics sells the Company s products to a limited number of customers. One customer, Panasonic Communications Co., Ltd. ( Panasonic ), has continually accounted for a majority of the sales of Tomen Electronics. Sales to Panasonic through Tomen Electronics generated approximately 12% and 15% of the Company s total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 10% and 14% of the Company s total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
   NOTE G DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS   
     
  The Company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with FASB. ASC No. 815  Derivatives and Hedging  ( ASC 815 ). Due to the Company s global operations, it is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of its business. The Company s treasury policy allows it to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures through the purchase of foreign exchange forward contracts and put options (collectively,  hedging contracts ). The policy, however, prohibits the Company from speculating on hedging contracts for profit.  
     
  To protect against the increase in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows resulting from salary and lease payments of its Israeli facilities denominated in the Israeli currency, the New Israeli Shekels ( NIS ), during the year, the Company instituted a foreign currency cash flow hedging program. The Company hedges portions of the anticipated payroll and lease payments denominated in NIS for a period of one to twelve months with hedging contracts. Accordingly, when the dollar strengthens against the foreign currencies, the decline in present value of future foreign currency expenses is offset by losses in the fair value of the hedging contracts. Conversely, when the dollar weakens, the increase in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows is offset by gains in the fair value of the hedging contracts. These hedging contracts are designated as cash flow hedges, as defined by ASC 815 and are all effective hedges of these expenses.  
     
  In accordance with ASC 815, for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge (i.e. hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk), the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any gain or loss on a derivative instrument in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows of the hedged item is recognized in current earnings during the period of change. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had outstanding option contracts in the amount of $5,400 and no outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts. These hedging contracts do not contain any credit-risk-related contingency features. See Note K for information on the fair value of these hedging contracts.  
     
  The fair value of derivative assets and derivative liabilities were $93 and $5, respectively, at September 30, 2016. The Company recorded a net amount of $88 in other accounts receivable in the condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2016.  
     
  The amount recorded as an expense in research and development expenses, sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 that resulted from the above referenced hedging transactions was $1, $0 and $0, respectively  .  

15

The amount recorded as income in research and development expenses, sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 that resulted from the above referenced hedging transactions was $12, $1 and $2, respectively.

NOTE h   CONTINGENCIES   
     
  From time to time, the Company may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising from its ordinary course of business. In addition, as is typical in the semiconductor industry, the Company has been and may from time to time be notified of claims that the Company may be infringing patents or intellectual property rights owned by third parties. The Company currently believes that there are no claims or actions pending or threatened against it, the ultimate disposition of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.

The following   table provides information by value level for assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015.  

In addition to the assets and liabilities described above, the Company s financial instruments also include cash and cash equivalents, restricted and short-term deposits, trade receivables, other accounts receivable, trade payables  , accrued expenses and other payables. The fair value of these financial instruments was not materially different from their carrying values at September 30, 2016 due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.  
     
   NOTE l STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY   
     
  During   the first nine months of 2016, the Company repurchased approximately 623,000 shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $9.76 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $6,081. As of September   3  0, 2016, approximately 750,000 shares of common stock remained authorized for repurchase under the Company s board-authorized share repurchase program.  
     
  Repurchases of common stock are accounted for as treasury stock, and result in a reduction of stockholders    equity. When treasury shares are reissued, the Company accounts for the reissuance in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 6,  Status of Accounting Research Bulletins  and charges the excess of the repurchase cost over issuance price using the weighted average method to accumulated deficit. In the case where the repurchase cost over issuance price using the weighted average method is lower than the issuance price, the Company credits the difference to additional paid-in capital.  
     
  During the first nine months of 2016, the Company issued approximately 1,059,000 shares of common stock out of treasury   stock to employees who exercised their stock options, SARs or RSUs, or purchased shares from the Company s 1993 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

Segment data:   
     
  The Company derives the results of its business segments directly from its internal management reporting system and by using certain allocation methods. The accounting policies the Company uses to derive business segment results are substantially the same as those the Company uses for consolidation of its financial statements. The CODM measures the performance of each business segment based on several metrics, including earnings from operations. The CODM uses these results, in part, to evaluate the performance of, and to assign resources to, each of the business segments. The Company does not allocate to its business segments certain operating expenses, which it manages separately at the corporate level. These unallocated costs include primarily amortization of purchased intangible assets, equity-based compensation expenses, and certain corporate governance costs.

   DSP   Group  , Inc. is referred to in this Quarterly Report as  DSP Group,   we,   us   our  or  company.    
     
    Overview    
     
  The following discussion and analysis is intended to provide investors with a narrative of our financial results and an evaluation of our financial condition and results of operations. The discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.  
     
    Business Overview    
     
  DSP Group is a leading global provider of wireless chipset solutions for converged communications, delivering system solutions that combine semiconductors and software with reference designs. We provide a broad portfolio of wireless chipsets integrating DECT, Wi-Fi, PSTN and VOIP technologies with state-of-the-art application processors. We also enable converged voice, audio and data connectivity across diverse consumer products   from cordless and VOIP phones to home gateways and connected multimedia screens. A majority of our revenues is derived from products targeted for digital cordless telephony. Such revenues currently represent approximately 56% of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2016,   down from 74% for the first nine months of 2015 as revenues generated from our new products increased significantly during this time period.  
     
  Our revenues were $102.6 million for the first nine months of 2016, a decrease of 7% in comparison to the same period of 2015, mainly due to a decrease in sales of our cordless telephony and home gateway products, offset to some extent by an increase in sales of our VOIP and HDClear (Mobile) products. Revenues from our new products accounted for 44% of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2016, up 56% year over year.  
     
  Sales of our HDClear products were $13.1 million for the first nine months of 2016, representing 13% of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2016. Sales of our HDClear products were $0.1 million for the first nine months of 2015.   
     
  Sales of our VOIP products increased from $15.1 million for the first nine months of 2015 to $20.2 million for the first nine months of 2016, representing 20% of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2016, as compared to 14% of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2015.  
     
  Sales of our home gateway products decreased from $11.2 million for the first nine months of 2015 to $8.4 million for the first nine months of 2016, representing 8% of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2016, as compared to 10% of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2015.  
     
  Sales of our cordless telephony products decreased from $81.6 million for the first nine months of 2015 to $57.4 million for the first nine months of 2016, representing 56% of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2016, as compared to 74% of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2015. We believe that the decline was primarily attributable to an inventory correction cycle that started in early fourth quarter of 2015 but the market is gradually recovering from since the second quarter of 2016. We believe the projected rate of decline in our revenues for this mature market will go back to the secular market decline levels of 10% to 15% on an annual basis.  

28

As the percentage of our overall revenues derived from new products increases, our gross margin increased to 43.8% of revenues for the first nine months of 2016 from 41.0% for the first nine months of 2015, primarily due to a change in the mix of products sold and mix of customers  , mostly the shifting of revenues from cordless telephony products to new products with higher gross margin, offset to some extent by a decrease in total revenues and an increase in royalties primarily in the mobile segment in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the first nine months of 2015.  
     
  Our operating income was $3.1 million for the first nine months of 2016, as compared to an operating income of $1.2 million for the first nine months of 2015. The increase in operating income was mainly as a result of (i) $2.5 million of other income  , related to the reversal of certain provisions due to the elapse of   the applicable statute of limitations  , (ii) higher gross margin during the first nine months of 2016, as compared to   the first nine months of 2015  , and (iii)   lower general and administrative expenses, mainly as a result of the reimbursement of legal expenses, in the amount of $0.4 million, as a result of the finalization of an arbitration proceeding. The overall increase was partially offset by (x) a   decrease in total revenues for the comparable periods, and (y) an increase in sales and marketing expenses during the first nine months of 2016, as compared to   the first nine months of 2015, due to increased sales commissions, mainly attributable to our mobile segment.   Our operating expenses decreased to $41.9 million for the first nine months of 2016, as compared to $44.1 million for the first nine months of 2015.  
     
  Notwithstanding our success in increasing our gross margin as the percentage of our overall revenues derived from new products increases, we expect that our financial condition will continue to be challenged by the expected decline of the cordless telephony market. With the rapid deployment of new communication access methods, including mobile, wireless broadband, cable and other connectivity, the traditional cordless telephony market using fixed-line telephony will continue to decline, which will   continue to reduce our revenues derived from, and unit sales of, cordless telephony products.   Furthermore, our business also may be significantly affected by the outcome of the competition between cellular phone operators and fixed-line operators for the provision of residential communication. A significant majority of our revenues are currently generated from sales of chipsets used in cordless phones that are based on fixed-line telephony. If we are unable to continue to develop new technologies to address alternative connectivity methods, our business could be materially adversely affected.  
     
  We see evidence that our past research and development investments in new technologies are materializing. We achieved a number of design wins for our new products and a number of such new products have begun mass shipments. Moreover, 2015 marked the achievement of a significant milestone for the company with initial mass production shipments of HDClear products to Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd ( Samsung ). In the first nine months of 2016, one of our HDClear products was integrated in one of Samsung s flagship mobile phones. Aggregate   revenues derived from our new products were 44% and 26% of our total revenues   for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Based on a strong pipeline of design wins, our current mix of new products and anticipated commercialization schedules of customers incorporating our new products, we anticipate annual revenues generated from our new products to increase significantly in 2016 as compared to 2015.  

29

However, despite our success thus far, we can provide no assurances about our continued success in introducing new products and penetrating new markets, as well as our predictions regarding market trends. Furthermore, although our new products targeted for mobile devices, home control   automation and enterprise VOIP solutions are gradually being introduced into the market, market adoption of such products is at early stages and may require us to increase our research and development spending to capitalize on opportunities in those markets. Moreover, although we have achieved a number of design wins with top-tier OEMs for new products, revenue generated from the commercialization of new products is a measured process as there is generally a long lead time from a design win to commercialization. From initial product design win to volume production, many factors could impact the timing and/or amount of sales actually realized from the design win. In addition to general price sensitivity and price erosion in the markets we operate, the introduction of new products may accelerate price erosion of older products. As a result, we expect the market to remain price sensitive for our traditional cordless telephony products and expect that price erosion and the decrease in the average selling prices of such products to continue. In addition, our continued success and growth in the new markets in which we have recently gained market share is highly dependent on our ability to be designed into future flagship products of top-tier OEMs in a very competitive marketplace. Furthermore, various other factors, including increases in the cost of raw materials and commodities and our suppliers passing such increases onto us, increases in silicon wafer costs and increases in production, assembly and testing costs, and shortage of capacity to fulfill our fabrication, assembly and testing needs, all may decrease our gross profit and harm our ability to grow our revenues in future periods.  
   
  As of September 30, 2016, our principal source of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $13.9 million and marketable securities and short term deposits of $106.6 million, totaling $120.5 million.  
     
   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   
     
    Total Revenues.   Our total revenues were $38.8 million for the third quarter of 2016, as compared to $35.2 million for the same period in 2015, representing and increase of 10%. Our total revenues were $102.6 million for the first nine months of 2016, as compared to $110.5 million for the same period in 2015. The increase in revenues for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the comparable period is mainly attributed to the increase in revenues of   our VoIP and HDClear products offset to some extent by the decrease in revenues of our cordless telephony products  .   The decrease in revenues for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the comparable periods of 2015 was primarily as a result of a decrease in sales of our cordless telephony and home gateway products, offset to some extent by an increase in sales of our VOIP and HDClear   products.  
     
  Sales of our cordless telephony products decreased from $25.5 million for the third quarter of 2015 to $22.2 million for the third quarter of 2016, representing 57% of our total revenues for the third quarter of 2016, as compared to 72% of our total revenues for the third quarter of 2015 and represented a decrease of 13% in absolute dollars for the comparable periods. The above mentioned decrease was mainly attributable to decreased demand from our customers in all markets, primarily because of an inventory correction cycle that has gradually improved since the second quarter of 2016. Sales of our cordless telephony products decreased from $81.6 million for the first nine months of 2015 to $57.4 million for the first nine months of 2016, representing 56% of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2016, as compared to 74% of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2015 and represented a decrease of 30% in absolute dollars for the comparable periods. The same factor as noted above attributed to the decrease for the nine-month period comparison.  
     
  Sales of our home gateway products increased from $2.3 million for the third quarter of 2015 to $3.1 million for the third quarter of 2016, representing 8% of our total revenues for the third quarter of 2016, as compared to 6% of our total revenues for the third quarter of 2015, and represented an increase of 36% in absolute dollars for the comparable periods. Sales of our home gateway products decreased from $11.2 million for the first nine months of 2015 to $8.4 million for the first nine months of 2016, representing 8% of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2016, as compared to 10% of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2015, and represented a decrease of 25% in absolute dollars for the comparable periods. The above mentioned decrease in sales of our home gateway products for the first nine months of 2016, as compared to the first nine months of 2015, was mainly attributable to lower demands from our customers.  

30

Sales of our VOIP products increased from $6.3 million for the third quarter of 2015 to $7.7 million for the third quarter of 2016, representing 20% of our total revenues for the third quarter of 2016, as compared to 18% of our total revenues for the third quarter of 2015, and represented an increase of 23% in absolute dollars for the comparable periods. Sales of VOIP products increased from $15.1 million for the first nine months of 2015 to $20.2 million for the first nine months of 2016, representing 20% of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2016, as compared to 14% of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2015, and represented an increase of 33% in absolute dollars for the comparable periods. The increase was mainly attributable to our increased market share within this domain.  
     
  Sales of our HDClear products were $4.6 and $13.1 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, representing 12% of our total revenues for the third quarter and 13% of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2016. Sales of our HDClear products were $0.1   million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2015. The increase was mainly attributable to the integration of our HDClear product in one of Samsung s flagship mobile phones.  
     
  The following table shows the breakdown of revenues for all product lines for the periods based on the geographic location of our customers (in thousands):  

Sales to our customers in Hong Kong decreased for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, as compared to the comparable periods of 2015, representing a 15% and 26% decrease in absolute dollars, respectively. The decrease in our sales to Hong Kong for the comparable periods resulted mainly from (i) a decrease in sales to VTech Holdings Ltd. ( VTech ), representing a 10% and 15% decrease in absolute dollars for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, as compared to the comparable periods of 2015, (ii) a decrease in sales to CCT Telecom Ltd, representing a 51% and 54% decrease in absolute dollars for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, as compared to the comparable periods of 2015, and (iii) a decrease in sales to Shenzhen Guo Wei Electronics Ltd. ( Guo Wei Electronics ), representing a 2% and 31% decrease in absolute dollars for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, as compared to the comparable periods of 2015.  
     
  Sales to our customers in Japan decreased for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same periods of 2015, representing a decrease of 20% and 36% in absolute dollars, respectively. The decrease in our sales to Japan for the comparable periods resulted mainly from (i) a decrease in sales to the Japanese domestic market, representing a 49% and 36% decrease in absolute dollars for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, as compared to the comparable periods of 2015, and (ii) a decrease in sales, through our distributor, Tomen Electronics, Ltd. ( Tomen Electronics ), to Panasonic Communications Ltd ( Panasonic ), representing a 9% and 34% decrease in absolute dollars for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, as compared to the comparable periods of 2015.

  We generated meaningful revenues from Samsung in Korea during the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 mainly due to the integration of our HDClear product in one of Samsung s flagship mobile phones. The discontinuation of one of the flagship mobile phones by Samsung in late third quarter 2016 will have a negative impact on our mobile revenues for the fourth quarter of 2016.  
     
  As our products are generally incorporated into consumer electronics products sold by our OEM customers, our revenues are affected by seasonal buying patterns of consumer electronics products sold by our OEM customers that incorporate our products, as well as inventory correction cycles within the market.  
     
    Significant Customers.   The Japanese and Hong Kong markets and the OEMs that operate in those markets are among the largest suppliers of residential wireless products with significant market share in the U.S. market.

    Significant Products.   Revenues from our digital cordless telephony products   represented 57% and 72% of our total revenues   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively  . Revenues from our digital cordless telephony products   represented 56% and 74% of our total revenues   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively  . We believe that sales of digital cordless telephony products   will continue to represent a substantial percentage of our revenues for the remainder of 2016. We believe that the rapid deployment of new communication access methods, as well as the lack of growth in fixed-line telephony, will reduce our total revenues derived from, and unit sales of, cordless telephony products for the short and long term.

    Gross Profit.   Gross profit as a percentage of revenues was 44.  8% for the third quarter of 2016 and 41.4% for the third quarter of 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues was 43.  8% for the first nine months of 2016 and 41.0% for the first nine months of 2015.   The increase in gross profit in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015 was mainly due to the mix of products and customers, mostly the shifting of revenues from cordless telephony products to new products with higher gross margin and an increase in total revenues for the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by an increase in royalties in the third quarter of 2016 compared to 2015, mainly in our mobile segment  . The increase in our gross profit for the first nine months of 2016 as compared to 2015, was primarily due to   a change in the mix of products sold and mix of customers  , mostly the shifting of revenues from cordless telephony products to new products with higher gross margins, offset to some extent by a decrease in total revenues and an increase in royalties in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to 2015, mainly in our mobile segment.   As gross profit reflects the sale of chips and chipsets that have different margins, changes in the mix of products sold have impacted and will continue to impact our gross profit in future periods. Our gross profit may decrease in the future due to a variety of factors, including the continued decline in the average selling prices of our products, changes in the mix of products sold, our failure to achieve cost reductions, roll-out of new products in any given period, our success in introducing new engineering processes to reduce manufacturing costs, increases in the cost of raw materials such as gold, oil and silicon wafers, and increases in production, assembly and testing costs. Moreover, our suppliers may pass the increase in the cost of raw materials and commodities onto us, which would further reduce the gross margins of our products. There are no guarantees that our ongoing efforts in cost reduction and yield improvements will keep pace with the anticipated continuing decline in average selling prices of our products.  

33

Cost of goods sold consists primarily of costs of wafer manufacturing and fabrication, assembly and testing of integrated circuit   devices and related overhead costs, and compensation and associated expenses related to manufacturing and testing support, inventory obsolesce and logistics personnel.

Description of Segments.   We operate under three reportable segments.  
     
  Our segment information has been prepared in accordance with ASC 280,  Segment Reporting.  Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise engaging in business activities about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the company s chief operating decision-maker ( CODM ) in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Our CODM is our Chief Executive Officer, who evaluates the Company s performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating income.  
     
  Our operating segments are as follows: Home, Office and Mobile. The classification of our business segments is based on a number of factors that management uses to evaluate, view and run its business operations, which include, but are not limited to, customer base, homogeneity of products and technology.  
     
  A description of the types of products provided by each business segment is as follows:  
     
  Home - Wireless chipset solutions for converged communication at home. Such solutions include integrated circuits targeted for cordless phones sold in retail or supplied by telecommunication service providers, home gateway devices supplied by telecommunication service providers which integrate the DECT/CAT-iq functionality, integrated circuits addressing home automation applications, as well as fixed-mobile convergence solutions. In this segment, (i) revenues from cordless telephony products exceeded 10% of our total revenues and amounted to 56% and 74% of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 57% and 72% of our total revenues for the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively, and (ii) revenues from home gateway products amounted to 8% and 10% of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 8% and 6% of our total revenues for the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
  Office - Comprehensive solution for Voice-over-IP (VOIP) office products, including office solutions that offer businesses of all sizes low-cost VOIP terminals with converged voice and data applications. Revenues from our VOIP products represented 20% and 14% of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Revenues from our VOIP products represented 20% and 18% of our total revenues for the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively. No revenues derived from other products in the office segment exceeded 10% of our total revenues for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2016 and 2015.  
     
  Mobile - Products for the mobile market that provides voice enhancement, always-on and far-end noise elimination targeted for mobile phone and mobile headsets and wearable devices that incorporate our noise suppression, always-on and voice quality enhancement HDClear technology. Revenues from our mobile products represented 13% and 0% of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Revenues from our mobile products represented 12% and 0% of our total revenues for the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively. No revenues derived from other products in the mobile segment exceeded 10% of our total revenues for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2016 and 2015.   
     
    Segment data.   We derive the results of our business segments directly from our internal management reporting system and by using certain allocation methods. The accounting policies we use to derive business segment results are substantially the same as those the Company uses for consolidation of our financial statements. The CODM measures the performance of each business segment based on several metrics, including earnings from operations. CODM uses these results, in part, to evaluate the performance of, and to assign resources to, each of the business segments. We do not allocate to our business segments certain operating expenses, which are managed separately at the corporate level. These unallocated costs include primarily amortization of purchased intangible assets, equity-based compensation expenses, and certain corporate governance costs.

Selected operating results information for each business segment was as follows for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Selected operating results information for each business segment was as follows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Sales to our customers in the home segment decreased for the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the comparable period of 2015, representing a decrease of 8% in absolute dollars. The decrease in sales in the home segment for the comparable periods was mainly attributable to decreased demands for cordless phones over the comparable periods, offset to some extent by increased demands for home gateway products over the comparable periods  .  
     
  Sales to our customers in the home segment decreased for the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the comparable period of 2015, representing a decrease of 27% in absolute dollars. The decrease in sales in the home segment for the comparable periods was mainly attributable to (i) decreased demands for cordless phones over the comparable periods, partially as a result of an inventory correction cycle that started in early fourth quarter of 2015  , and (ii) decreased demands for home gateway products over the comparable periods mainly due to unusually higher demand from our customers during the first half of 2015  .  
     
  Sales to our customers in the office segment increased for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the comparable periods of 2015, representing an increase of 23% and 33% in absolute dollars, respectively. The increase in sales in the office segment for the comparable periods was mainly due to an increase in demand due to our increased market share in this domain.  
     
  The increase in sales to our customers in the mobile segment for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 as compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2015 was mainly due to the integration of our HDClear product in one of Samsung s flagship mobile phones. The discontinuation of one of the flagship mobile phones by Samsung in late third quarter 2016 will have a negative impact on our mobile revenues for the fourth quarter of 2016.

The reconciliation of segment operating results information to our consolidated financial information is included in Note M to our condensed consolidated financial statements.  
     
    Amortization of Intangible Assets  . During the third quarter and the first nine months of 2016, we recorded an expense of $0.4 and $1 million, respectively, relating to the amortization of intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions. During the third quarter and the first nine months of 2015, we recorded an expense of $0.3 and $1 million, respectively, relating to the amortization of intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions.  
     
    Other Income,   during the third quarter of 2016, we recorded other income in the amount of $2.5 million related to the reversal of certain provisions due to the elapse of the applicable statute of limitations.   
     
    Financial Income, net.   Financial income, net, amounted to $0.3 million and $0.2 million for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Financial income, net, amounted to $0.9 million for both nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
     
    Provision for Income Taxes.   Our income tax expenses were $0.3 million and $0.5 million for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2016, as compared to $0.1 million and $0.4 million of income tax expenses for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2015.  
     
  The income tax expenses for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 were mainly attributed to current tax expenses of $0.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively, offset to some extent by income in the amount of $0.1 million and $0.3 million for the   third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively,   resulting from the amortization of deferred tax liability related to intangible assets acquired in connection with prior acquisitions.  
     
  The income tax expenses for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2015 were mainly attributed to current tax expenses of $0.2 million and $0.7 million, respectively, offset to some extent by income in the amount of $0.1 million and $0.3 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2015, respectively,   resulting from the amortization of deferred tax liability related to intangible assets acquired in connection with a prior acquisition  .  
     
   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   
     
    Operating Activities.   During the first nine months of 2016, we generated $5.9 million of cash and cash equivalents from our operating activities, as compared to $4.0 million of cash generated from operating activities for the first nine months of 2015. The increase in cash from our operating activities during the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the first nine months of 2015, was mainly due to (i) a decrease of $2.4 million in accounts payable for the first nine months of 2016 as compared to a decrease of $4.4 million in the first nine months of 2015  , and (ii) an increase in accrued compensation and benefits of $2.5 million in the first nine months of 2016, as compared to a decrease of $0.2 million in the first nine months of 2015  . The above mentioned increases in cash from our operating activities were offset to some extent by (x) a decrease of $1.6 million in inventories for the first nine months of 2016 as compared to a decrease of $3.5 million in the first nine months of 2015  , and (y) an increase of $3.5 million in trade receivables for the first nine months of 2016 as compared to an increase of $2.5 million in the first nine months of 2015.  

38

Investing Activities.   We invest excess cash in marketable securities of varying maturity, depending on our projected cash needs for operations, capital expenditures and other business purposes. During the first nine months of 2016, we purchased $46.3 million of marketable securities, as compared to $26.3 million of marketable securities during the first nine months of 2015. During the first nine months of 2016, $34.3 million of marketable securities matured and were called by the issuers, as compared to $14.2 million during the first nine months of 2015. During the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, $13.1 million and $11.5 million, respectively, of marketable securities were sold. As of September 30, 2016, the amortized cost of our marketable securities and short term deposits was $106.7 million and their stated market value was $106.6 million  , representing $0.1 million of unrealized losses.  
     
  Our capital equipment purchases, consisting primarily of research and development software tools, computers, peripheral, engineering test and lab equipment, leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, totaled $1.5 and $1.6 million, for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
  During the third quarter of 2016, we completed the acquisition of a private company in Asia which we had previously invested in and acquired the remaining 86% of the equity of that company, bringing our holding to 100%. As part of the acquisition, we paid $0.5 million to the company s shareholders.   
     
    Financing Activities.   During the first nine months of 2016, we paid an aggregate purchase price of $6.0 million to repurchase   approximately 613,000 shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $9.70 per share. During the first nine months of 2015, we repurchased   approximately 1,083,000 shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $10.34 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $11.2 million.  
     
  In addition, during the first nine months of 2016, we received $1.2 million upon the exercise of employee stock options, as compared to $1.1 million for the first nine months of 2015. We cannot predict cash flows from exercises of stock options for future periods.  
     
  Our board of directors has previously approved a number of share repurchase plans, including those in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, for the repurchase of our common stock. In August 2016, our board authorized a $10 million dollar buyback program, inclusive of the shares remaining from previously authorized share repurchase plans.  
     
  At September 30, 2016, approximately 750,000 shares of our common stock were available for repurchase under our board authorized share repurchase programs.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately $13.9 million and marketable securities and time deposits of approximately $106.6 million. Out of total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $120.5 million, $108.9 million was held by foreign entities. Our intent is to permanently reinvest earnings of our foreign operations and our current operating plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate foreign earnings to fund our U.S. operations. However, if these funds were needed for our operations in the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes as well as taxes in other countries to repatriate these funds. The determination of the amount of additional taxes related to the repatriation of these earnings is not practicable, as it may vary based on various factors such as the location of the cash and the effect of regulation in the various jurisdictions from which the cash would be repatriated.  

39

Our working capital at September 30,   2016 was approximately $  51.4   million, compared to $43.5 as of September 30, 2015. The increase in working capital was mainly due to (i) cash and cash equivalents generated between September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2016 from our operating activities, (ii) cash received upon the exercise of employees stock options in the amount of $1.3 million between September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2016  , and (iii) the replacement of l  ong term marketable securities and deposits with short term marketable securities and deposits. The above mentioned increases were offset to some extent by the repurchase of our common stock in the amount of $8.0 million between September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2016.   We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, cash deposits and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for both the short and long term.  
     
  In addition, as part of our business strategy, we may evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies. Accordingly, a portion of our available cash may be used at any time for the acquisition of complementary products or businesses. Such potential transactions may require substantial capital resources, which may require us to seek additional debt or equity financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions, integrate acquired businesses into our current operations, or expand into new markets. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us in any required time frame and on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. See the section of the risk factors entitled  We may engage in future acquisitions that could dilute our stockholders  equity and harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.  for more detailed information.  
     
    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    
     
  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as such term is defined in recently enacted rules by the Securities and Exchange Commission, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.  
     
   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   
     
    Interest Rate Risk.   It is our policy not to enter into interest rate derivative financial instruments, except for hedging of foreign currency exposures discussed below. We do not currently have any significant interest rate risk since we do not have any financial obligations.  
     
  The majority of our cash and cash equivalents are invested in high grade certificates of deposits with major U.S., European and Israeli banks. Generally, cash and cash equivalents and short term deposits may be redeemed and therefore minimal credit risk exists with respect to them. Nonetheless, cash deposits with these banks exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) insurance limits in the U.S. or similar limits in foreign jurisdictions, to the extent, such deposits are even insured in such foreign jurisdictions. While we monitor on a systematic basis the cash balances and adjust the balances as appropriate, these balances could be impacted if one or more of the financial institutions with which we deposit our funds fails or is subject to other adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets. To date we have experienced no loss of principal or lack of access to our cash; however, we can provide no assurances that access to our cash will not be affected if the financial institutions that we hold our cash fail or the financial and credit markets fail to recover fully.  
     
  We hold an investment portfolio of marketable securities consisting principally of debentures of U.S. corporations, and U.S. government sponsored enterprises. We intend, and have the ability, to hold such investments until recovery of any temporary declines in market value or maturity.  

40

Interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents and within our investment portfolio have not had, and are not currently anticipated to have, a material effect on our financial position on an annual or quarterly basis.  
     
    Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk  . A significant part of our sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. Part of our expenses in Israel is paid in NIS, which subjects us to the risks of foreign currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the NIS. Our primary expenses paid in NIS are employee salaries and lease payments on our Israeli facilities. Furthermore, a portion of our expenses for our European operations are paid in the Euro, which subjects us to the risks of foreign currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Euro. Our primary expenses paid in Euro are employee salaries, lease and operational payments on our European facilities. To partially protect the company against an increase in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows resulting from salary and lease payments denominated in NIS during 2016, we instituted a foreign currency cash flow hedging program. The option and forward contracts used are designated as cash flow hedges, as defined by FASB ASC No. 815,  Derivatives and Hedging,  and are all effective as hedges of these expenses. For more information about our hedging activity, see Note G to the attached Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement for the period ended September 30, 2016. An increase in the value of the NIS and the Euro in comparison to the U.S. dollar could increase the cost of our research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses, all of which could harm our operating profit. Although we currently are using a hedging program to minimize the effects of currency fluctuations relating to the NIS, our hedging position is partial, may not exist at all in the future and may not succeed in minimizing our foreign currency fluctuation risks.

  See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.   
     
   ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   
     
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016.  
     
  There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.  
     
   PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   
     
   ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.   
     
  From time to time, we may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising from our ordinary course of business. In addition, as is typical in the semiconductor industry, we have been and may from time to time be notified of claims that we may be infringing patents or intellectual property rights owned by third parties. We currently believe that there are no claims or actions pending or threatened against us, the ultimate disposition of which would have a material adverse effect on our company.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.   
     
  There are no material changes to the Risk Factors described under the title  Factors That May Affect Future Performance  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 other than (1) changes to the Risk Factor below entitled  We generate a significant amount of our total revenues from the sale of digital cordless telephony products and our business and operating results may be materially adversely affected if we do not continue to succeed in this highly competitive market or if sales within the overall cordless digital market decreases;    (2) changes to the Risk Factor below entitled  We rely significantly on revenue derived from a limited number of customers;    (3) changes to the Risk Factor below entitled  Our future success is dependent on market acceptance of our HDClear product family targeted for the mobile device market and market acceptance of our VOIP products, which are intensively competitive markets with dominant and established players;  (4) changes to the Risk Factor below entitled  We rely on a few distributors for a significant portion of our total revenues and the failure of those distributors to perform as expected would materially reduce our future sales and revenues;  (5) changes to the Risk Factor below entitled    Because we have significant international operations, we may be subject to political, economic and other conditions relating to our international operations that could increase our operating expenses and disrupt our business;  (6)   changes to the Risk Factor below entitled  We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates;  and (7) changes to the Risk Factor below entitled  Because we have significant operations in Israel, we may be subject to political, economic and other conditions affecting Israel that could increase our operating expenses and disrupt our business  .   
     
    We generate a significant amount of our total revenues from the sale of digital cordless telephony products and our business and operating results may be materially adversely affected if we do not continue to succeed in this highly competitive market or if sales within the overall cordless digital market continue to decrease.    
     
  Sales of our digital cordless telephony products comprised 56% and 74% of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Any adverse change in the digital cordless market or in our ability to compete and maintain our competitive position in that market would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.  
     
  The digital cordless telephony market is undergoing a challenging period. With the rapid deployment of new communication access methods, including mobile, wireless broadband, cable and other connectivity, the traditional cordless telephony market using fixed-line telephony is declining and will continue to decline, which reduces our revenues derived from, and unit sales of, cordless telephony products. Moreover, macro-economic trends in the consumer electronics industry may adversely impact our future revenues.  
     
  Furthermore, the decline in fixed line telephony together with the rapid deployment of new communication access methods, including mobile, wireless broadband, cable and other connectivity will decrease sales of products using fixed-line telephony. Our business also may be affected by the outcome of the competition between cellular phone operators and fixed-line operators for the provision of residential communication. A significant majority of our revenues are currently generated from sales of chipsets used in cordless phones that are based on fixed-line telephony, and the continued decline in fixed-line telephony would reduce our revenues derived from, and unit sales of, our digital cordless telephony products.  
     
  As an example, revenues from cordless telephony products decreased by 30% from the first nine months of 2015 to the first nine months of 2016. We currently believe that this reduction is mostly attributable to inventory correction cycles of our customers and their customers and that there are gradual improvements since the second quarter of 2016. However, we can provide no assurance that our revenue decline rates will revert back to the secular market decline levels of 10% to 15% for the reminder of 2016.  

42

In addition, the digital cordless telephony market is competitive and is facing pricing pressures, and we expect that competition and pricing pressures will continue. It is possible that we may one day be unable to respond to increased pricing competition for digital cordless telephony processors or other products through the introduction of new products or reduction of manufacturing costs. This inability to compete would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Likewise, any significant delays by us in developing, manufacturing or shipping new or enhanced products in this market also would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  
     
    We rely significantly on revenue derived from a limited number of customers.    
     
  We expect that a limited number of customers, varying in identity from period-to-period, will account for a substantial portion of our revenues in any period. Our four largest customers   VTech, Panasonic (through Tomen), Guo Wei Electronics and Samsung accounted for approximately 59% and 56% of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales to VTech represented 29% and 31% of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales to Panasonic represented 10% and 13% of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales to Shenzhen Guo Wei Electronics Ltd represented 8% and 11% of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively; Sales to Samsung represented 13% and 0% of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015. Typically, our sales are made on a purchase order basis, and none of our customers has entered into a long-term agreement requiring it to purchase our products. Moreover, we do not typically require our customers to purchase a minimum quantity of our products, and our customers can generally reschedule the delivery date of their orders on short notice without significant penalties. A significant amount of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of large customers. Furthermore, the primary customers for our products are original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and original design manufacturers (ODMs) in the cordless digital market. This industry is highly cyclical and has been subject to significant economic downturns at various times, particularly in recent periods. These downturns are characterized by production overcapacity and reduced revenues, which at times may affect the financial stability of our customers. Therefore, the loss of one of our major customers, or reduced demand for products from, or the reduction in purchasing capability of, one of our major customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  
     
    Our future success is dependent on market acceptance of our HDClear product family targeted for the mobile device market and on market acceptance of our VOIP products, which are intensively competitive markets with dominant and established players.    
   
  Our ability to increase our revenues and offset declining revenues from our cordless product family are substantially dependent on our ability to gain market share for our HDClear and VOIP product families. Moreover, we are targeting a new market with our HDClear product family, a market with dominant and established players selling to OEM customers with whom they have established relationships. We will need to win over such customers, with whom we do not have established relationships, to gain market share. If we are unable to generate meaningful revenues from our HDClear product family and gain significant market share in the mobile device market, our operating results would be adversely affected. Furthermore, our future growth is also dependent on the market acceptance of our VOIP products, a market where we also compete with existing and potential competitors, many of whom have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution resources and management expertise than we do. Moreover, all of our current revenues from HDClear products are generated from a sole customer and any changes to the product line up or production schedule of such sole customer could negatively impact our financial results. In addition, our continued success and growth in the new markets in which we have recently gained market share is highly dependent on our ability to be designed into future flagship products of top-tier OEMs in a very competitive marketplace.  

43

The     market     for mobile device components is highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future.    
     
  The market for mobile device components is highly competitive and characterized by the presence of large companies with significantly greater resources than we have. Our HDClear product family relates only to the voice and audio subsystem of a mobile device and there are only a limited number of OEMs targeted for this market. Our main competitors for this market include Knowles Corporation (that acquired Audience) and Cirrus Logic. We also face competition from other companies and could face competition from new market entrants. We also compete against solutions internally developed by OEMs, as well as combined third-party software and hardware systems. If we are unable to compete effectively, we may not succeed in achieving additional design wins and may have to lower our pricing to gain design wins, both of which would adversely impact our operating results.  
     
    Because our products are components of end products, if OEMs do not incorporate our products into their end products or     if     the end products of our OEM customers do not achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to generate adequate sales of our products.    
     
  Our products are not sold directly to the end-user; rather, they are components of end products. As a result, we rely upon OEMs to incorporate our products into their end products at the design stage. Once an OEM designs a competitor s product into its end product, it becomes significantly more difficult for us to sell our products to that customer because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort and risk for the customer. As a result, we may incur significant expenditures on the development of a new product without any assurance that an OEM will select our product for design into its own product and without this  design win  it becomes significantly difficult to sell our products. This is especially the case for our HDClear product family. Moreover, even after an OEM agrees to design our products into its end products, the design cycle is long and may be delayed due to factors beyond our control which may result in the end product incorporating our products not to reach the market until long after the initial  design win  with the OEM. From initial product design-in to volume production, many factors could impact the timing and/or amount of sales actually realized from the design-in. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the competitive position of our technology, our customers  financial stability, and our ability to ship products according to our customers  schedule. Moreover, the continued uncertainty about the sustainability of the global economic recovery and outlook may further prolong an OEM customer s decision-making process and design cycle Furthermore, we rely on the end products of our OEM customers that incorporate our products to achieve market acceptance. Many of our OEM customers face intense competition in their markets. If end products that incorporate our products are not accepted in the marketplace, we may not achieve adequate sales volume of our products, which would have a negative effect on our results of operations.  

44

We rely on a few distributors for a significant portion of our total revenues and the failure of those distributors to perform as expected would materially reduce our future sales and revenues.    
     
  In addition to direct sales, we use a network of distributors to sell our products. Particularly, revenues derived from sales through our Japanese distributor, Tomen Electronics, accounted for 12% and 17% of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Revenues derived from sales through another distributor, Ascend Technology, accounted for 16% of our total revenues for both nine month periods of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our future performance will depend, in part, on those distributors to continue to successfully market and sell our products. Furthermore, Tomen Electronics sells our products to a limited number of customers. One customer, Panasonic, has continually accounted for a majority of the sales through Tomen Electronics. Sales to Panasonic through Tomen Electronics generated 10% and 13% of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. The loss of Tomen Electronics and/or Ascend Technology as our distributors and our inability to obtain satisfactory replacements in a timely manner would materially harm our sales and results of operations. Additionally, the loss of Panasonic and Tomen Electronics  inability to thereafter effectively market our products would also materially harm our sales.  
     
    Because our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly, the price of our common stock may decline.    

Our quarterly results of operations may vary significantly in the future for a variety of reasons, many of which are outside our control, including the following:     

fluctuations in volume and timing of product orders;     

timing, rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability, as well as the ability of our customers, to manage inventory;     

changes in demand for our products due to seasonal consumer buying patterns and other factors;     

timing of new product introductions by us and by our customers or competitors;     

changes in the mix of products sold by us or our competitors;     

fluctuations in the level of sales by our OEM customers and other vendors of end products incorporating our products;     

timing and size of expenses, including expenses to develop new products and product improvements, and expenses resulting from restructuring activities;     

entry into new markets, including China, Korea and South America;     

our ability to scale our operations in response to changes in demand for our existing products and services or demand for new products requested by our customers;     

mergers and acquisitions by us, our competitors and our existing and potential customers; and     

general economic conditions, including current economic conditions in the United States and worldwide, and the adverse effects on the semiconductor and consumer electronics industries.     
   
  Each of the above factors is difficult to forecast and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we sell our products to OEM customers that operate in consumer markets. As a result, our revenues are affected by seasonal buying patterns of consumer products sold by our OEM customers that incorporate our products and the market acceptance of such products supplied by our OEM customers.  

45

Our revenues, gross margins and profitability may be materially adversely affected by the continued decline in average selling prices of our products and other factors, including increases in assembly and testing expenses, and raw material and commodity costs.    
     
  We have experienced and will continue to experience a decrease in the average selling prices of our products. Decreasing average selling prices could result in decreased revenues even if the volume of products sold increases. Decreasing average selling prices may also require us to sell our products at much lower gross margin than in the past and reduce profitability. Although we have to date been able to partially offset on an annual basis the declining average selling prices of our products through general operational efficiencies and manufacturing cost reductions by achieving a higher level of product integration and improving our yield percentages, there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts will be successful or that they will keep pace with the anticipated, continued decline in average selling prices of our products.  
     
  Moreover, we believe there are significant pressures in the supply chain as a result principally of the uncertainty relating to the sustainability of the global economic recovery, which has negatively affected the consumer electronics industry. The pressures in the supply chain make it very difficult for us to increase or even maintain our product pricing, which further adversely affects our gross margins.  
     
  In addition to the continued decline in the average selling prices of our products, our gross profit may decrease in the future due to other factors, including the roll-out of new products in any given period and the penetration of new markets which may require us to sell products at a lower margin, our failure to introduce new engineering processes and mix of products sold.  
     
  Our gross margins also are affected by the product mix. For example, mature products have lower average gross margins than other products. Therefore, increased sales of certain products would lower our gross margins.  
     
  Furthermore, increases in the price of silicon wafers, testing costs and commodities such as gold and oil, which may result in increased production costs, mainly assembly and packaging costs, may result in a decrease in our gross margins. Moreover, our suppliers may pass the increase in raw materials and commodity costs onto us, which would further reduce the gross margin of our products. In addition, as we are a fabless company, global market trends such as  over-capacity  problems so that there is a shortage of capacity to fulfill our fabrication needs also may increase our raw material costs and thus decrease our gross margin.  
     
    There are several emerging market trends that     may     challenge our ability to continue to grow our business.    
     
  New technological developments in the home connectivity market may adversely affect our operating results. For example, the rapid deployment of new communication access methods, including mobile, wireless broadband, cable and other connectivity, as well as the lack of growth in products using fixed-line telephony would reduce our total revenues derived from, and unit sales of, cordless fixed-line telephony products. Our ability to maintain our growth will depend on the expansion of our product lines to capitalize on the emerging access methods and on our success in developing and selling a portfolio of  system-on-a-chip  solutions targeted at wider markets, including the intensively competitive mobile devices market. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in expanding our product lines or portfolio of  system-on-a-chip  solutions, or that they would receive market acceptance.  

46

Furthermore, there is a growing threat from alternative technologies accelerating the decline of the fixed-line telephony market. This competition comes from mobile telephony, including emerging dual-mode mobile Wi Fi phones and other innovative applications, such as Skype and iChat. Given that we derive a significant amount of revenues from chipsets incorporated into fixed-line telephony products, if we are unable to develop new technologies in the face of the decline of this market, our business could be materially adversely affected.  
     
    Our future business growth depends on the growth in demand for mobile devices with improved sound quality and always on     capability      .    
     
  Our HDClear product family is designed to enhance the sound quality and eliminate background voices for mobile device users and to enable always on capabilities in mobile and other wearable devices. OEMs and ODMs may decide that the costs of improving sound quality outweigh the benefits or that always on voice technology is not a required feature, both of which could limit demand for our HDClear product family. Moreover, users may also be satisfied with existing sound quality or blame poor quality on their phone carriers. The market that we are targeting is evolving rapidly and is technologically challenging. New mobile devices with different components or software may be introduced that provide the same functionality as HDClear product family. Our future business growth will depend on the growth of this market and our ability to adapt to technological changes, user preferences and OEM demands. Our business could be materially adversely affected if we fail to do so.  
     
    Because we have significant international operations, we may be subject to political, economic and other conditions relating to our international operations that could increase our operating expenses and disrupt our business.    
     
  Although the majority of end users of the consumer products that incorporate our products are located in the U.S., we are dependent on sales to OEM customers, located outside of the U.S., that manufacture these consumer products. In addition, we depend on a network of distributors to sell our products that also are primarily located outside of the U.S. Export sales, primarily consisting of digital cordless telephony products shipped to manufacturers in Europe and Asia, including Japan and Asia Pacific, represented 97% and 98% of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Furthermore, we have material operations in Germany, Hong Kong and India and employ a number of individuals within those foreign operations. As a result, the occurrence of any negative international political, economic or geographic events, as well as our failure to mitigate the challenges in managing an organization operating in various countries, could result in significant revenue shortfalls and disrupt our workforce within our foreign operations. These shortfalls and disruptions could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to be harmed. Some of the risks of doing business internationally include:  

unexpected changes in foreign government regulatory requirements;      

fluctuations in the exchange rate for the United States dollar;      

import and export license requirements;      

imposition of tariffs and other barriers and restrictions;      

47 

burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, treaties and technical standards;      

uncertainty of laws and enforcement in certain countries relating to the protection of intellectual property;      

difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles for international customers than existing customers;      

difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations and maintaining the morale and productivity of employees within foreign operations;      

multiple and possibly overlapping tax structures and potentially adverse tax consequences;      

political and economic instability; and      

changes in diplomatic and trade relationships.     
   
  One or more of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our future operations and consequently, on our business, financial conditions and operating results.  
     
    In order to sustain the future growth of our business, we must penetrate new markets and our new products must achieve widespread market acceptance.    
     
  In order to increase our sales volume and expand our business, we must penetrate new markets and introduce new products, especially our HDClear product family. We are exploring opportunities to expand sales of our products in China, Japan, Korea and South America. However, there are no assurances that we will gain significant market share in those competitive markets. In addition, due to the cyclical nature of manufacturing capacity issues, the increasing cost of silicon integrated circuits, the continued decline of average selling prices of chipsets and other industry-wide factors, many North American, European and Japanese OEMs are moving their manufacturing sites to Asia. This trend may cause the mix of our OEM customers to change in the future, thereby further necessitating our need to penetrate new markets. Furthermore, to sustain the future growth of our business, we need to introduce new products as sales of our older products taper off. Moreover, the penetration of new competitive markets and introduction of new products could require us to reduce the sale prices of our products or increase the cost per product and thus reducing our total gross profit in future periods. Our revenue growth is dependent on the successful deployment of our new VOIP and HDClear products. Our inability to penetrate such markets and increase our market share in those markets or lack of customer acceptance of those products may harm our business and potential growth.  
     
    Because the markets in which we compete are subject to rapid changes, our products may become obsolete or unmarketable.    
     
  The markets for our products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technology, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, changes in customer needs, demand for higher levels of integration, growing competition and new product introductions. This is especially the case for the mobile device market. Our future growth is dependent not only on the continued success of our existing products but also successful introduction of new products. Our ability to adapt to changing technology and anticipate future standards, and the rate of adoption and acceptance of those standards, will be a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and prospects for growth. If new industry standards emerge, our products or our customers  products could become unmarketable or obsolete, and we could lose market share. We may also have to incur substantial unanticipated costs to comply with these new standards. If our product development and improvements take longer than planned, the availability of our products would be delayed. Any such delay may render our products obsolete or unmarketable, which would have a negative impact on our ability to sell our products and our results of operations.  

48

Because of changing customer requirements and emerging industry standards, we may not be able to achieve broad market acceptance of our products. Our success is dependent, in part, on our ability to: successfully develop, introduce and market new and enhanced products at competitive prices and in a timely manner in order to meet changing customer needs; convince leading OEMs to select our new and enhanced products for design into their own new products; respond effectively to new technological changes or new product announcements by others; effectively use and offer leading technologies; and maintain close working relationships with our key customers.  
     
  There are no assurances that we will be successful in these pursuits, that the demand for our products will continue or that our products will achieve market acceptance. Our failure to develop and introduce new products that are compatible with industry standards and that satisfy customer requirements, and the failure of our products to achieve broad market acceptance, could have a negative impact on our ability to sell our products and our results of operations.  
     
    Because we depend on independent foundries and other third party suppliers to manufacture and test all of our integrated circuit products, we are subject to additional risks that may materially disrupt our business.    
     
  All of our integrated circuit products are manufactured and tested by independent foundries and other third party suppliers. While these foundries and other third party suppliers have been able to adequately meet the demands of our increasing business, we are and will continue to be dependent upon these foundries and third party suppliers to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields, quality levels and costs, and to allocate to us a sufficient portion of their foundry, assembly and test capacity to meet our needs in a timely manner.  
     
  While we currently believe we have adequate capacity to support our current sales levels pursuant to our arrangement with our foundries and other third party suppliers, we may encounter capacity shortage issues in the future. In the event of a worldwide shortage in foundry, assembly and/or test capacity, we may not be able to obtain a sufficient allocation of such capacity to meet our product needs or we may incur additional costs to ensure specified quantities of products and services. Over-capacity at the current foundries and other third party suppliers we use, or future foundries or other third party suppliers we may use, to manufacture and test our integrated circuit products may lead to increased operating costs and lower gross margins. In addition, such a shortage could lengthen our products  manufacturing and testing cycle and cause a delay in the shipment of our products to our customers. This could ultimately lead to a loss of sales of our products, harm our reputation and competitive position, and our revenues could be materially reduced. Our business could also be harmed if our current foundries or other third party suppliers terminate their relationship with us and we are unable to obtain satisfactory replacements to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis and in a cost-effective manner. Moreover, we do not have long term capacity guarantee agreements with our foundries and with other third party suppliers.  
     
  In addition, as TSMC produces a significant portion of our integrated circuit products and a limited number subcontractors tests and assembles a significant portion of them, earthquakes, aftershocks or other natural disasters in Asia, or adverse changes in the political situation in Taiwan, could preclude us from obtaining an adequate supply of wafers to fill customer orders. Such events could harm our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.  

49

Our operating results are affected by general economic conditions and the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry.    
     
  Notwithstanding improvements in business conditions since the global downturn in 2008 and 2009, recovery is slow and general worldwide economic conditions remain uncertain which continues to make it difficult for our customers, the end-product customers, our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and make reliable projections.Moreover, we operate within the semiconductor industry, which experiences significant fluctuations in sales and profitability. Downturns in the semiconductor industry are characterized by diminished product demand, excess customer inventories, accelerated erosion of prices and excess production capacity. These factors could cause substantial fluctuations in our revenues and in our results of operations.If global economic and market conditions remain uncertain or deteriorate, we could experience a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.  
     
    Because the manufacture of our products is complex, the foundries on which we depend may not achieve the     necessary     yields or product reliability that our business requires      .    
     
  The manufacture of our products is a highly complex and precise process, requiring production in a highly controlled environment. Changes in manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective or contaminated materials by a foundry could adversely affect the foundry s ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and product reliability. If the foundries we currently use do not achieve the necessary yields or product reliability, our ability to fulfill our customers  needs could suffer. This could ultimately lead to a loss of sales of our products and have a negative effect on our gross margins and results of operations.  
     
  Furthermore, there are other significant risks associated with relying on these third-party foundries, including: risks due to the fact that we have reduced control over production cost, delivery schedules and product quality; less recourse if problems occur as the warranties on wafers or products supplied to us are limited; and increased exposure to potential misappropriation of our intellectual property.  
     
    As we depend on independent subcontractors, located in Asia, to assemble and test our semiconductor products, we are subject to additional risks that may materially disrupt our business.    
     
  Independent subcontractors, located in Asia, assemble and test our semiconductor products. Because we rely on independent subcontractors to perform these services, we cannot directly control our product delivery schedules or quality levels. We are dependent on these subcontractors to allocate to us a sufficient portion of their capacity to meet our needs in a timely manner. Our future success also depends on the financial viability of our independent subcontractors. If the capital structures of our independent subcontractors weaken, we may experience product shortages, production delays, quality assurance problems, increased manufacturing costs, and/or supply chain disruption. All of this could ultimately lead to a loss of sales of our products, harm our reputation and competitive position, and our revenues could be materially harmed.  
     
  Moreover, the economic, market, social, and political situations in countries where some of our independent subcontractors are located are unpredictable, can be volatile, and can have a significant impact on our business because we may not be able to obtain product in a timely manner. Market and political conditions, including currency fluctuation, terrorism, political strife, war, labor disruption, and other factors, including natural or man-made disasters, adverse changes in tax laws, tariff, import or export quotas, power and water shortages, or interruption in air transportation, in areas where our independent subcontractors are located also could have a severe negative impact on our operating capabilities.

We are subject to order and shipment uncertainties and if we are unable to accurately predict customer demand, our business may be harmed.    
     
  We typically sell products pursuant to purchase orders rather than long-term purchase commitments. Customers can generally change or defer purchase orders on short notice without incurring a significant penalty. Given current market conditions, we have less ability to accurately predict what or how many products our customers will need in the future. In addition, we have little visibility into and no control of the demand by our customer s customers   generally consumer electronics retailers. Furthermore, based on discussions with our customers, we understand that our customers also have less visibility into their product demands. A decrease in the consumer electronics retailers  demand or a build-up of their inventory, both of which are out of the control of our customers and us, may cause a cancellation, change or deferral of purchase orders on short notice by our customers. Anticipating demand is difficult because our customers and their customers face volatile pricing and unpredictable demand for their own products, and are increasingly focused on cash preservation and tighter inventory management. Based on these trends, our customers are reluctant to place orders with normal lead times, and we are seeing a shift to shorter lead-times and rush orders. However, we place orders with our suppliers based on forecasts of our customers  demand and, in some instances, may establish buffer inventories to accommodate anticipated demand. Our forecasts are based on multiple assumptions, each of which may introduce error into our estimates. If we overestimate our customers  demand or our customers overestimate their demand, we may allocate resources to manufacturing products that we may not be able to sell when we expect to, if at all. As a result, we could hold excess or obsolete inventory, which would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our financial results. Conversely, if we underestimate our customers  demand or our customers underestimate their demand and insufficient manufacturing capacity is available, we could forego revenue opportunities and potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships.  
     
  Furthermore, we maintain inventory, or hubbing, arrangements with certain of our customers. Pursuant to these arrangements, we deliver products to a customer or a designated third party warehouse based upon the customer s projected needs, but do not recognize product revenue unless and until the customer reports that it has removed our product from the warehouse to incorporate into its end products. Since we own inventory that is physically located in a third party s warehouse, our ability to effectively manage inventory levels may be impaired, causing our total inventory turns to decrease, which could increase expenses associated with excess and obsolete product and negatively impact our cash flow.  
     
    We are dependent on a small number of OEM customers, and our business could be harmed by the loss of any of these customers or reductions in their purchasing volumes.    
     
  We sell our products to a limited number of OEM customers directly or through a network of distributors. Moreover, many North American, European and Japanese OEMs are moving their manufacturing sites to Southeast Asia, as a result of the cyclical nature of manufacturing capacity issues and cost of silicon integrated circuits, the continued decline of average selling prices of chipsets and other industry-wide factors. In addition, OEMs located in Southeast Asia are growing and gaining competitive strength. As a result, the mix of our OEM customers may change in the future. However, we may not succeed in attracting new customers as these potential customers may have pre-existing relationships with our current or potential competitors. This trend also may promote the consolidation of OEMs located in North America, Europe and Japan with OEMs located in Southeast Asia, which may reduce the number of our potential customers and reduce the volume of chipsets the combined OEM customer may purchase from us. However, as is common in our industry, we typically do not enter into long term contracts with our customers in which they commit to purchase products from us. The loss of any of our OEM customers may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. To attract new customers, we may be faced with intense price competition, which may affect our revenues and gross margins.  

51

The possible emerging trend of our OEM customers outsourcing their production may cause our revenue to decline.    
     
  We believe there may be an emerging trend of our OEM customers outsourcing their production to third parties. We have invested substantial resources to build relationships with our OEM customers. However the outsourcing companies whom our OEM customers may choose to outsource production may not have prior business relationship with us or may instead have prior or ongoing relationships with our competitors. The emergence of this trend may require us to expend substantial additional resources to build relationships with these outsourcing companies, which would increase our operating expenses. Even if we do expend such resources, there are no assurances that these outsourcing companies will choose to incorporate our chipsets rather than chipsets of our competitors. Our inability to retain an OEM customer once such customer chooses to outsource production would have a material adverse effect on our future revenue.  
     
    Third party claims of infringement or other claims against us could adversely affect our ability to market our products, require us to redesign our products or seek licenses from third parties, and seriously harm our operating results and disrupt our business.    
     
  As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we and our customers have been and may from time to time be notified of claims that we may be infringing patents or intellectual property rights owned by third parties. In addition, patent infringement claims are increasingly being asserted by patent holding companies (so-called patent  trolls ), which do not use technology and whose sole business is to enforce patents against companies, such as us, for monetary gain. Because such patent holding companies do not provide services or use technology, the assertion of our own patents by way of counter-claim may be ineffective. We have received claims that our products infringe upon the proprietary rights of such patent holding companies. In addition, third parties have asserted and may in the future assert intellectual property infringement claims against our customers, which we have agreed in certain circumstances to indemnify and defend against such claims. If litigation becomes necessary to determine the validity of any third party claims, it could result in significant expense to us and could divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not the claim has merit and notwithstanding that the litigation is determined in our favor.  
     
  If it appears necessary or desirable, we may try to obtain licenses for those patents or intellectual property rights that we are allegedly infringing. Although holders of these types of intellectual property rights commonly offer these licenses, we cannot assure you that licenses will be offered or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us. Our failure to obtain a license for key intellectual property rights from a third party for technology used by us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities, suspend the manufacturing of products utilizing the technology or damage the relationship with our customers. Alternatively, we could be required to expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology. We cannot assure you that we would be successful in developing non-infringing technology. The occurrence of any of these events could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.  

52

Because we have significant operations in Israel, we may be subject to political, economic and other conditions affecting Israel that could increase our operating expenses and disrupt our business.    
     
  Our principal research and development facilities are located in the State of Israel and, as a result, at September 30, 2016, 206 of our 333 employees were located in Israel, including 139 out of 206 of our research and development personnel. In addition, although we are incorporated in Delaware, a majority of our directors and executive officers are residents of Israel. Although substantially all of our sales currently are being made to customers outside of Israel, we are nonetheless directly influenced by the political, economic and military conditions affecting Israel. Any major hostilities involving Israel, or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners, could significantly harm our business, operating results and financial condition.  
     
  Israel s economy has been subject to numerous destabilizing factors, including a period of rampant inflation in the early to mid-1980s, low foreign exchange reserves, fluctuations in world commodity prices, military conflicts and civil unrest. In addition, Israel and companies doing business with Israel have been the subject of an economic boycott by the Arab countries since Israel s establishment. Although they have not done so to date, these restrictive laws and policies may have an adverse impact on our operating results, financial condition or expansion of our business.  
     
  Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a state of hostility has existed, varying in degree and intensity, between Israel and the Arab countries. Although Israel has entered into various agreements with certain Arab countries and the Palestinian Authority, and various declarations have been signed in connection with efforts to resolve some of the economic and political problems in the Middle East, hostilities between Israel and some of its Arab neighbors have recently escalated and intensified. We cannot predict whether or in what manner these conflicts will be resolved. Our results of operations may be negatively affected by the obligation of key personnel to perform military service. In addition, certain of our officers and employees are currently obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israel Defense Forces and are subject to being called for active military duty at any time. Although we have operated effectively under these requirements since our inception, we cannot predict the effect of these obligations on the company in the future. Our operations could be disrupted by the absence, for a significant period, of one or more of our officers or key employees due to military service.  
     
    The tax benefits available to us under Israeli law require us to meet several conditions, and may be terminated or reduced in the future, which would increase our taxes.    
     
  Our facilities in Israel have been granted Approved Enterprise and Beneficiary Enterprise status under the Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959, commonly referred to as the  Investment Law,  as amended. The Investment Law provides that capital investments in a production facility (or other eligible assets) designated as an Approved Enterprise or Beneficiary Enterprise receive certain tax benefits in Israel. Our investment programs that generate taxable income are currently subject to an average tax rate of up to approximately 10% based on a variety of factors, including percentage of foreign ownership and approvals for the erosion of the tax basis of our investment programs. To be eligible for tax benefits, we must meet certain conditions, relating principally to adherence to the investment program filed with the Investment Center of the Israeli Ministry of Economy and periodic reporting obligations. Although we believe we have met such conditions in the past, should we fail to meet such conditions in the future, we would be subject to corporate tax in Israel at the standard corporate tax rate (25% for 2016) and could be required to refund tax benefits (including with interest and adjustments for inflation based on the Israeli consumer price index) already received. Our average tax rate for our investment programs also may change in the future due to circumstances outside of our control, including changes to legislation. For example, in July 2013, the Investment Law was amended whereby the reduction of corporate tax rate for preferred enterprises was eliminated such that such enterprises, which are subject to the new law, would be subject to a 16% tax rate. Therefore, we cannot provide any assurances that our average tax rate for our investment programs will continue in the future at their current levels, if at all. The termination or reduction of certain programs and tax benefits or a requirement to refund tax benefits (including with interest and adjustments for inflation based on the Israeli consumer price index) already received may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.  

53

We may engage in future acquisitions that could dilute our stockholders  equity and harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.    
     
  We have pursued, and will continue to pursue, growth opportunities through internal development and acquisition of complementary businesses, products and technologies. We are unable to predict whether or when any other prospective acquisition will be completed. The process of integrating an acquired business may be prolonged due to unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our resources and management s attention. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions, integrate acquired businesses into our operations, or expand into new markets. Further, once integrated, acquisitions may not achieve comparable levels of revenues, profitability or productivity as our existing business or otherwise perform as expected. The occurrence of any of these events could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. Future acquisitions may require substantial capital resources, which may require us to seek additional debt or equity financing.  
     
  Future acquisitions by us could result in the following, any of which could seriously harm our results of operations or the price of our stock: issuance of equity securities that would dilute our current stockholders  percentages of ownership; large one-time write-offs; the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities; difficulties in the assimilation and integration of operations, personnel, technologies, products and information systems of the acquired companies; diversion of management s attention from other business concerns; contractual disputes; risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or only limited prior experience; and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations.  
     
    We may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, which could harm our competitive position.    
     
  Our success and ability to compete is in part dependent upon our internally-developed technology and other proprietary rights, which we protect through a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as through confidentiality agreements and licensing arrangements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants. In addition, we have filed a number of patents in the United States and in other foreign countries with respect to new or improved technology that we have developed. However, the status of any patent involves complex legal and factual questions, and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any patent application filed by us will result in a patent being issued, or that the patents issued to us will not be infringed by others. Also, our competitors and potential competitors may develop products with similar technology or functionality as our products, or they may attempt to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our product line or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Moreover, the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold, including Hong Kong, Japan, Korea and Taiwan, may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult and may result in significant expense to us and could divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. Even if we spend significant resources and efforts to protect our intellectual property, we cannot assure you that we will be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology. Use by others of our proprietary rights could materially harm our business and expensive litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights.

Because our products are complex, the detection of errors in our products may be delayed, and if we deliver products with material defects, our credibility will be harmed, the sales and market acceptance of our products may decrease and product liability claims may be made against us.    
     
  Our products are complex and may contain errors, defects and bugs when introduced. If we deliver products with material errors, defects or bugs, our credibility and the market acceptance and sales of our products could be significantly harmed. Furthermore, the nature of our products may also delay the detection of any such error or defect. If our products contain material errors, defects and bugs, then we may be required to expend significant capital and resources to alleviate these problems. This could result in the diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts. Any actual or perceived problems or delays may also adversely affect our ability to attract or retain customers. Furthermore, the existence of any defects, errors or failures in our products could lead to product liability claims or lawsuits against us or against our customers. We generally provide our customers with a standard warranty for our products, generally lasting one year from the date of purchase. Although we attempt to limit our liability for product defects to product replacements, we may not be successful, and customers may sue us or claim liability for the defective products. A successful product liability claim could result in substantial cost and divert management s attention and resources, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  
     
    We are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets, which could result in material losses.    
     
  Most of our sales are on an open credit basis. Because of current conditions in the global economy, our exposure to credit risks relating to sales on an open credit basis has increased. We expect demand for enhanced open credit terms, for example, longer payment terms, to continue and believe that such arrangements are a competitive factor in obtaining business. Although we monitor and attempt to mitigate credit risks, including through insurance coverage from time to time, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be effective. Moreover, even if we attempt to mitigate credit risks through insurance coverage, such coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses and we would be subject to a deductible under any insurance coverage. As a result, our future credit risk exposure may increase. Although any losses to date relating to credit exposure of our customers have not been material, future losses, if incurred, could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Moreover, the loss of a customer due to its financial default also could harm our future business and potential growth.  

55

Our executive officers and key personnel are critical to our business, and because there is significant competition for personnel in our industry, we may not be able to attract and retain such qualified personnel.    
     
  Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our executive management team, and our technical, marketing, sales customer support and product development personnel. The loss of significant numbers of such personnel could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not have any life insurance or other insurance covering the loss of any of our key employees. Because our products are specialized and complex, our success depends upon our ability to attract, train and retain qualified personnel, including qualified technical, marketing and sales personnel. However, the competition for personnel is intense and we may have difficulty attracting and retaining such personnel.  
     
    We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities as a result of our foreign operations.    
     
  We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. In addition to our significant operations in Israel, we have operations in Germany, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and India. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities and as an example, we are now under audit for one of our subsidiaries, the outcome of which could have material adverse impact on our financial condition. Our intercompany transfer pricing may be reviewed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and by foreign tax jurisdictions. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, due to the complexity of our corporate structure, the multiple intercompany transactions and the various tax regimes, we cannot assure you that a tax audit or tax dispute to which we may be subject will result in a favorable outcome for us. If taxing authorities do not accept our tax positions and impose higher tax rates on our foreign operations, our overall tax expenses could increase.  
     
    We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.    
     
  A significant portion of our business is conducted outside the United States. Export sales to manufacturers in Europe and Asia, including Japan and Asia Pacific, represented 97% and 98% of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Although most of our revenue and expenses are transacted in U.S. dollars, we may be exposed to currency exchange fluctuations in the future as business practices evolve and we are forced to transact business in local currencies. Moreover, part of our expenses in Israel are paid in Israeli currency, which subjects us to the risks of foreign currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the New Israeli Shekel (NIS) and to economic pressures resulting from Israel s general rate of inflation. Our primary expenses paid in NIS are employee salaries and lease payments on our Israeli facilities. Furthermore, a portion of our expenses for our European operations are paid in the Euro, which subjects us to the risks of foreign currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Euro. Our primary expenses paid in the Euro are employee salaries, lease and operational payments on our European facilities. As a result, an increase in the value of the NIS and Euro in comparison to the U.S. dollar due to the devaluation of the U.S. dollar, could increase the cost of our technology development, research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses, all of which could harm our operating profit. From time to time, we use derivative instruments in order to minimize the effects of currency fluctuations, but our hedging positions may be partial, may not exist at all in the future or may not succeed in minimizing our foreign currency fluctuation risks. Our financial results may be harmed if the trend relating to the devaluation of the U.S. dollars continues for an extended period.  
     
    Because the markets in which we compete are highly competitive, and many of our competitors have greater resources than we do, we cannot be certain that our products will be accepted in the marketplace or capture market share.    
     
  The markets in which we operate are extremely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change, evolving standards, short product life cycles and price erosion. We expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product offerings and new competitors enter the market. Given the highly competitive environment in which we operate, we cannot be sure that any competitive advantages enjoyed by our current products would be sufficient to establish and sustain our new products in the market. Any increase in price or competition could result in the erosion of our market share, to the extent we have obtained market share, and would have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  

56

In each of our business activities, we face current and potential competition from competitors that have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution resources and management expertise than we do. These competitors may also have pre-existing relationships with our customers or potential customers. Further, in the event of a manufacturing capacity shortage, these competitors may be able to manufacture products when we are unable to do so. Our principal competitors in the cordless market include Lantiq and Dialog Semiconductors. Our principal competitors in the VOIP market include Broadcom, Dialog Semiconductors, Infineon, Texas Instruments and new Taiwanese IC vendors.  
     
  As discussed above, various new developments in the home residential market may require us to enter into new markets with competitors that have more established presence, and significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution resources and management expertise than we do. The expenditure of greater resources to expand our current product lines and develop a portfolio of  system-on-a-chip  solutions that integrate video, voice, data and communication technologies in a wider multimedia market may increase our operating expenses and reduce our gross profit. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in developing and introducing new products that are responsive to market demands.  
     
    An unfavorable government review of our federal income tax returns or changes in our effective tax rates could adversely affect our operating results.    
     
  Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof. In addition, we are subject to the periodic examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, as an example, we are now under audit for one of our subsidiaries. The outcome from this examination may have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.  
     
    Our business operations would be disrupted if the information technology systems we rely on fail to function properly.    
     
  We rely on complex information technology systems to manage our business, which operates in many geographical locations. For example, to achieve short delivery lead times and superior levels of customer service while maintaining low levels of inventory, we constantly adjust our production schedules with manufacturers and subcontractors. We develop and adjust these schedules based on end customer demand as communicated by our customers and distributors and based on our inventory levels, manufacturing cycle times, component lead times, and projected production yields. We combine and distribute all of this information electronically over a complex global communications network. Our ability to estimate demand and to adjust our production schedules is highly dependent on this network. Any delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the transition to, new or enhanced processes, systems or controls, could adversely affect our ability to manage customer orders and manufacturing schedules, as well as generate accurate financial and management information in a timely manner. These systems are also susceptible to power and telecommunication disruptions and other system failures. Failure of our IT systems or difficulties in managing them could result in business disruption. Our business could be significantly disrupted and we could be subject to third party claims associated with such disruptions.  

57

We may experience difficulties in transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies or in achieving higher levels of design integration, which may result in reduced manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses.    
     
  A growing trend in our industry is the integration of greater semiconductor content into a single chip to achieve higher levels of functionality. In order to remain competitive, we must achieve higher levels of design integration and deliver new integrated products on a timely basis. This will require us to expend greater research and development resources, and may require us to modify the manufacturing processes for some of our products, to achieve greater integration. We periodically evaluate the benefits, on a product-by-product basis, of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies to reduce our costs. Although this migration to smaller geometry process technologies has helped us to offset the declining average selling prices of our products, this effort may not continue to be successful. In addition, because we are a fabless semiconductor company, we depend on our foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully. We cannot assure you that our foundries will be able to effectively manage the transition. In case our foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.  
     
    The anti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could prevent or discourage a third party from acquiring us.    
     
  Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may prevent or discourage a third party from acquiring us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders. Our board of directors also has the authority to fix the rights and preferences of shares of our preferred stock and to issue such shares without a stockholder vote. Our bylaws also place limitations on the authority to call a special meeting of stockholders. Our stockholders may take action only at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent. We have advance notice procedures for stockholders desiring to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders. In addition, these factors may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.  
     
    Our stock price may be volatile so you may not be able to resell your shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid for them.    
     
  Announcements of developments related to our business, announcements by competitors, quarterly fluctuations in our financial results, changes in the general conditions of the highly dynamic industry in which we compete or the national economies in which we do business, and other factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially. In addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced extreme price fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. These factors and fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.

ITEM 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.   
     
  During the third quarter of 2016, we repurchased 215,040 shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $11.18 per share for approximately $2.4 million. The table below sets forth the information with respect to repurchases of our common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

(1)   
 
  The number represents the number of shares of our common stock that remained available for repurchase as of September 30, 2016 pursuant to our board s authorizations.     
     
  Our board of directors has previously approved a number of share repurchase plans, including those in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, for the repurchase of our common stock. In August 2016, our board authorized a $10 million dollar buyback program, inclusive of the shares remaining from previously authorized share repurchase plans.  
     
  At September 30, 2016, 748,660 shares of our common stock are available for repurchase under our board authorized share repurchase program. The repurchase program is being affected from time to time, depending on market conditions and other factors, through Rule 10b5-1 plans, open market purchases and privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase program has no set expiration or termination date.

1.   
 
  I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of DSP Group, Inc.;     

2.
