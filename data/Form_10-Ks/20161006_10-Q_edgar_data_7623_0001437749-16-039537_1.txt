Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   

1)    
 
   Description of the Company      
     
  Unless otherwise specified, as used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the terms  we,   us,   our,   Art s-Way,  and the  Company,  refer to Art s-Way Manufacturing Co., Inc., a Delaware corporation headquartered in Armstrong, Iowa, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.  
     
  We began operations as a farm equipment manufacturer in 1956. Since that time, we have become a major worldwide manufacturer of agricultural equipment. Our principal manufacturing plant is located in Armstrong, Iowa.  
     
  We have organized our business into three operating segments. Management separately evaluates the financial results of each segment because each is a strategic business unit offering different products and requiring different technology and marketing strategies. Our agricultural products segment ( Manufacturing ) manufactures farm equipment under the Art s-Way Manufacturing label and private labels. Our modular buildings segment ( Scientific ) manufactures modular buildings for various uses, commonly animal containment and research laboratories and our tools segment ( Metals ) manufactures steel cutting tools and inserts. During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we announced the discontinuation of our pressurized vessels segment ( Vessels ) that manufactured pressurized vessels. For more information on discontinued operations, see Note 3  Discontinued Operations.  For detailed financial information relating to segment reporting, see Note 13  Segment Information.   

2)    
 
   Summary of Significant Account Policies      
     
  Statement Presentation  
     
  The foregoing condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company are unaudited and reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and operating results for the interim periods. The financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2015. The results of operations for the three and nine-months ended August 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the fiscal year ending November 30, 2016  .  
     
  The financial books of our Canadian operation are kept in the functional currency of Canadian dollars and the financial statements are converted to U.S. Dollars for consolidation. When consolidating the financial results of the Company into U.S. Dollars for reporting purposes, the Company uses the All-Current translation method. The All-Current method requires the balance sheet assets and liabilities to be translated to U.S. Dollars at the exchange rate as of quarter end. Owner s equity is translated at historical exchange rates and retained earnings are translated at an average exchange rate for the period. Additionally, revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the periods presented. The resulting cumulative translation adjustment is carried on the balance sheet and distributed among various balance sheet accounts. The Company monitors the amount of the adjustment and considers it to be immaterial.

Estimates  
     
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the three and nine-months ended August 31, 2016. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
     
  Reclassification  
     
  Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements of the Company related to the discontinuation of operations at our Vessels division have been reclassified to conform to classifications used in the current year. The reclassifications had no effect on previously reported results of operations or retained earnings.  

3)    
 
   Discontinued Operations      
       
  On August 11, 2016, the Company announced its plan to discontinue the operations of its Art s Way Vessels segment in order to focus its efforts and resources on the business segments that have historically been more successful and that are expected to present greater opportunities for meaningful long-term shareholder returns. Our plan is to dispose of these assets over the next several quarters. At this time, we are working with local businesses to sell our remaining inventory, which we expect to complete within the next several months.   
     
  As Vessels was a unique business unit of the Company, its liquidation will be a strategic shift. In accordance with Accounting Standard Code Topic 360, the Company has classified Vessels as discontinued operations for all periods presented.  
     
  Income from discontinued operations, before income taxes in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, is comprised of the following:  

The components of discontinued operations in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows:

4)    
 
   Net Income (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock      
     
  Basic net income (loss) per common share has been computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income (loss) per share has been computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus equivalent shares assuming exercise of stock options. Potential shares of common stock that have an anti-dilutive effect (i.e., those that increase income per share or decrease loss per share) are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS.  
     
  Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share have been computed based on the following as of August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015:

   Product Warranty      
     
  The Company offers warranties of various lengths to its customers depending on the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement. The average length of the warranty period is one year from the date of purchase. The Company s warranties require it to repair or replace defective products during the warranty period at no cost to the customer. The Company records a liability for estimated costs that may be incurred under its warranties. The costs are estimated based on historical experience and any specific warranty issues that have been identified. Although historical warranty costs have been within expectations, there can be no assurance that future warranty costs will not exceed historical amounts. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liability and adjusts the balance as necessary. The accrued warranty balance is included in accrued expenses as shown in Note 6. Changes in the Company s product warranty liability for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015 are as follows:

   Loan and Credit Agreements      
       
  The Company maintains a revolving line of credit and term loans with U.S. Bank as well as a term loan with The First National Bank of West Union. Pursuant to a Second Loan Modification Agreement dated July 12, 2016 and effective July 11, 2016 (the  Loan Modification ) entered into among U.S. Bank, as lender, the Company, as borrower, and Art s-Way Scientific, Inc., Art s-Way Vessels, Inc., and Ohio Metal Working Products/Art s-Way, Inc., as guarantors, the agreements governing the U.S. Bank line of credit and certain term loans were amended, and a $200,000 line of credit that the Company had opened to facilitate dealer floorplan financing but had not drawn on was terminated, along with the related agreements. The description that follows reflects such arrangements as amended by the Loan Modification.  
     
   U.S. Bank   Revolving Line   of Credit   
     
  The Company has a $5,000,000 revolving line of credit (the  Line of Credit ) with U.S. Bank that was obtained on May 1, 2013, which is renewable annually with advances funding the Company s working capital needs. As of August 31, 2016, the Company had a principal balance of $3,434,114 outstanding against the Line of Credit, with $1,565,886 remaining available, limited by the borrowing base calculation. The Line of Credit matures on May 1, 2017 and is secured by real property and fixed asset collateral. The Line of Credit states that the borrowing base will be an amount equal to the sum of 75% of accounts receivable (discounted for aged accounts and customer balances exceeding 20% of aggregate receivables), plus 50% of inventory (this component cannot exceed $3,750,000 and only includes finished goods and raw materials deemed to be in good condition and not obsolete), less any outstanding loan balance of the Line of Credit and the 2015 Line of Credit (defined below), and less undrawn amounts of outstanding letters of credit issued by U.S. Bank or any affiliate. Monthly interest-only payments are required and the unpaid principal and accrued interest is due on the maturity date. The Company s obligations under the Line of Credit are evidenced by a Revolving Credit Note effective May 1, 2013, a Revolving Credit Agreement dated May 1, 2013, as amended by the Loan Modification, and certain other ancillary documents.  
     
  The Line of Credit is subject to: (i) a minimum interest rate of 5.0% per annum; and (ii) an unused fee which accrues at the rate of 0.25% per annum on the average daily amount by which the amount available for borrowing under the Line of Credit exceeds the outstanding principal amount. As of August 31, 2016, the interest rate on the Line of Credit was the minimum of 5.0%.

U.S. Bank Term Loans   
     
  On May 10, 2012, the Company obtained $880,000 in long-term debt from U.S. Bank issued to acquire the building and property of Universal Harvester Co., Inc. located in Ames, Iowa (the  U.S. Bank UHC Loan ), the assets and operations of which are now held by Art s Way Manufacturing Co., Inc. in Armstrong, Iowa. The maturity date of this loan is May 10, 2017, with a final payment of principal and accrued interest in the amount of $283,500 due May 10, 2017. The principal balance of this loan was $369,378 as of August 31, 2016 and it accrues interest at a fixed rate of 3.15% per annum. This loan was secured by a mortgage on the building and property acquired from Universal Harvester Co., Inc. in Ames, Iowa, pursuant to a Mortgage, Security Agreement and Assignment of Rents between the Company and U.S. Bank, dated May 10, 2012, which was released upon the sale of our Ames, Iowa facility. The U.S. Bank UHC Loan is also secured by a mortgage on the building and property in Monona, Iowa, pursuant to a Mortgage, Security Agreement and Assignment of Rents between the Company and U.S. Bank, dated May 1, 2013 and a mortgage on the building and property owned by Art s-Way Vessels, Inc. in Dubuque, Iowa, pursuant to a Mortgage, Security Agreement and Assignment of Rents between Art s-Way Vessels, Inc. and U.S. Bank, dated May 1, 2013. On May 1, 2013, the U.S. Bank UHC Loan and the   mortgage were amended to extend the mortgage to secure the 2013 Term Notes (defined below) in addition to the U.S. Bank UHC Loan.  
     
  Three of the Company s outstanding term loans were obtained from U.S. Bank on May 1, 2013. The principal balance of these loans totaled $2,293,094 at August 31, 2016, and they accrue interest at a fixed rate of 2.98% per annum (the  2013 Term Notes ). There was previously also a fourth term loan obtained from U.S. Bank on May 1, 2013, but the Company voluntarily paid off and terminated the note and the related Term Loan Agreement on February 10, 2016. The payoff amount of $1,078,196 included principal and accrued and unpaid interest. As detailed in the Company s long-term debt summary below, monthly principal and interest payments in the aggregate amount of $51,350 are required on the remaining 2013 Term Notes, with final payments of principal and accrued interest on the three remaining loans in the aggregate amount of $1,363,000 due on May 1, 2018.  
     
  The Company obtained a term loan from U.S. Bank on May 29, 2014 in the original principal amount of $1,000,000 (the  2014 Term Note ). The 2014 Term Note had a principal balance of $914,480 at August 31, 2016 and accrues interest at a fixed rate of 2.98%. The Company took on the 2014 Term Note in order to partially pay down a draw on its revolving line of credit that it had used to finance the   purchase of the building and property of Ohio Metal Working Products Company in Canton, Ohio. The maturity date of the 2014 Term Note is May 25, 2017, with a final payment of principal and accrued interest in the amount of $890,000 due May 25, 2017. This loan is secured by a mortgage on the building and property acquired from Ohio Metal Working Products Company in Canton, Ohio pursuant to a Mortgage, Security Agreement and Assignment of Rents between the Company and U.S. Bank, dated May 29, 2014, and is also subject to a Business Security Agreement between Ohio Metal Working Products/Art s Way, Inc. ( Ohio Metal ) and U.S. Bank and a Continuing Guaranty (Unlimited) by Ohio Metal. Each of the Company s term loans from U.S. Bank is governed by a Term Note and a Term Loan Agreement.  
     
   U.S. Bank Covenants   
     
  The U.S. Bank UHC Loan is not subject to financial covenants. However, under the U.S. Bank UHC Loan, the Company must provide to U.S. Bank information concerning its business affairs and financial condition as the bank may reasonably request, as well as annual financial statements prepared by an accounting firm acceptable to U.S. Bank within 120 days of the end of the year without request.

As amended by the Loan Modification, the Line of Credit, the 2013 Term Notes and the 2014 Term Note require the Company to maintain (i) a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.15 to 1.0 as of the end of each fiscal quarter (except for the fiscal quarters ended August 31, 2016, November 30, 2016 and February 28, 2017), (ii) a fiscal year-to-date fixed charge coverage ratio as of February 28, 2017 of at least 1.0 to 1.0, (iii) a fiscal year-to-date EBITDA (with EBITDA meaning income, plus interest expense, plus income tax expense, plus depreciation expense, plus amortization expense, subject to adjustments in USB s sole discretion) of $360,000 as of August 31, 2016, of $390,000 as of September 30, 2016, of $395,000 as of October 31, 2016, and of $400,000 as of November 30, 2016, and (iv) minimum liquidity as of the end of each month commencing August 31, 2016 of not less than $750,000 (with minimum liquidity meaning unrestricted cash and cash equivalents plus borrowing base availability under the Line of Credit, the 2013 Term Notes and the 2014 Term Note). The Company must also provide to U.S. Bank a 13-week cash flow forecast on Tuesday of each week  , a detailed backlog report by segment as of the last day of each calendar month, monthly internally prepared financial reports, year-end audited financial statements, and a monthly aging of accounts receivable, and must deliver along with any financial statements delivered to U.S. Bank a certificate of compliance executed by the Company s chief financial officer certifying the Company s compliance with the financial covenants.  
     
  The 2013 Term Notes, 2014 Term Note, and Line of Credit are secured by a first position security interest on the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, including but not limited to, inventories, machinery, equipment and real estate, in accordance with Business Security Agreements entered into by the Company and its subsidiaries, Pledge Agreements entered into by the subsidiaries and Collateral Assignment of Dealer s Notes and Security Agreements entered into by the Company. Additionally, the Company has mortgaged certain real property noted above and in favor of U.S. Bank as documented by mortgage agreements dated May 1, 2013 and May 29, 2014 (together, the  Mortgages ).  
     
  If the Company or its subsidiaries (as guarantors pursuant to continuing guaranties) commits an event of default with respect to the U.S. Bank UHC Loan, 2013 Term Notes, 2014 Term Note, or Line of Credit and fails or is unable to cure that default, the interest rate on each of the loans and Line of Credit could increase by 5.0% per annum, U.S. Bank can immediately terminate its obligation, if any, to make additional loans to the Company, and U.S. Bank may accelerate the Company s obligations under the applicable loan or line of credit. U.S. Bank shall also have all other rights and remedies for default provided by the Uniform Commercial Code, as well as any other applicable law and the various loan agreements, including, without limitation, the right to repossess, render unusable and/or dispose of the collateral without judicial process. In addition, in an event of default, U.S. Bank may foreclose on mortgaged property pursuant to the terms of the Mortgages.   
     
  The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Line of Credit, the 2013 Term Notes and the 2014 Term Note as measured on August 31, 2016.  
     
   Iowa Finance Authority Term Loan and Covenants   
     
  On May 1, 2010, the Company obtained a loan to finance the purchase of an additional facility located in West Union, Iowa to be used as a distribution center, warehouse facility, and manufacturing plant for certain products under the Art s-Way brand. The funds for this loan were made available by the Iowa Finance Authority by the issuance of tax exempt bonds. This loan had an original principal amount of $1,300,000, an interest rate of 3.5% per annum and a maturity date of June 1, 2020. On February 1, 2013, the interest rate was decreased to 2.75% per annum. The other terms of the loan remain unchanged.  

- 10 -

This loan from the Iowa Finance Authority, which has been assigned to The First National Bank of West Union (n/k/a Bank 1 st ), is governed by a Manufacturing Facility Revenue Note dated May 28, 2010 as amended February 1, 2013 and a Loan Agreement dated May 1, 2010 and a First Amendment to Loan Agreement dated February 1, 2013 (collectively,  the IFA Loan Agreement ), which requires the Company to provide quarterly internally prepared financial reports and year-end audited financial statements and to maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.5 to 1.0, which is measured at November 30 of each year. Among other covenants, the IFA Loan Agreement also requires the Company to maintain proper insurance on, and maintain in good repair, the West Union Facility, and continue to conduct business and remain duly qualified to do business in the State of Iowa. The loan is secured by a mortgage on the Company s West Union Facility, pursuant to a Mortgage, Security Agreement, Assignment of Leases and Rents and Fixture Financing Statement dated May 1, 2010 between the Company and The First National Bank of West Union (the  West Union Mortgage ).  
     
  If the Company commits an event of default under the IFA Loan Agreement or the West Union Mortgage and does not cure the event of default within the time specified by the IFA Loan Agreement, the lender may cause the entire amount of the loan to be immediately due and payable and take any other action that it is lawfully permitted to take or in equity to enforce the Company s performance.  
     
  The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the IFA Loan Agreement except the debt service coverage ratio as measured on November 30, 2015. The First National Bank of West Union has issued a waiver, and the next measurement date is November 30, 2016.

       Assets Available for Sale      
     
  Major components of assets available for sale (excluding assets of discontinued operations as discussed in Note 3  Discontinued Operations ) are:  

Due to reduced demand for our reels produced by the Universal Harvester by Art s Way subsidiary, we have been able to absorb the production of reels in our Armstrong, Iowa facility. The Ames, Iowa facility was sold on February 10, 2016 for $1,192,000. After closing expenses, we recognized a gain on this sale of $36,000. The proceeds of this sale were used to pay down term debt, as previously discussed in Note 8.   
     
  The storage facility in Monona, Iowa is adjacent to our production facilities, and was sold in December 2015. We recorded a gain of $4,000 in December 2015 after closing costs associated with the sale.

   Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements      
     
   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   
     
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  which supersedes the guidance in  Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)  and requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period and is to be applied retrospectively, with early application permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are evaluating the new standard, but do not at this time expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.   
     
   Going Concern   
     
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern  which is authoritative guidance on management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and provide related footnote disclosures, codified in ASC 205-40,  Going Concern . The guidance provides a definition of the term substantial doubt, requires an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods, provides principles for considering the mitigating effect of management s plans, requires certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management s plans, requires an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and requires an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). ASU No. 2015-15 is effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016. The Company will adopt this guidance for the fiscal year ending November 30, 2017, and it will apply to each interim and annual period thereafter. Its adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  

- 12 -

Inventory   
     
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,  Inventory (Topic 330) , which requires inventory measured using any method other than last-in, first-out or the retail inventory method to be subsequently measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value, rather than the lower of cost or market. ASU No. 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those years. The Company will adopt this guidance for the year-ended November 30, 2018 including interim periods within that reporting period. Its adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740) , to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes. Under the new standard, both deferred tax liabilities and assets are required to be classified as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. ASU No. 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company will adopt this guidance for the year-ended November 30, 2019, and interim periods within the year-ended November 30, 2020. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
     
   Leases   
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (topic 842) , which requires a lessee to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on its balance sheet for all leases with terms of twelve months or greater. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those years. The Company will adopt this guidance for the year-ended November 30, 2020 including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.

       Equity Incentive Plan and Stock Based Compensation      
     
  On January 27, 2011, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized and approved the Art s-Way Manufacturing Co., Inc. 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2011 Plan ).  The 2011 Plan was approved by the stockholders on April 28, 2011.  It replaced the Employee Stock Option Plan and the Directors  Stock Option Plan (collectively, the  Prior Plans ), and no further stock options will be awarded under the Prior Plans.  Awards to directors and executive officers under the 2011 Plan will be governed by the forms of agreement approved by the Board of Directors.  
     
  The 2011 Plan permits the plan administrator to award nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance awards, and stock appreciation rights to employees (including officers), directors, and consultants.  The Board of Directors has approved a director compensation policy pursuant to which non-employee directors are automatically granted restricted stock awards of 1,000 shares of common stock annually or initially upon their election to the Board, which are fully vested. During the first nine months of fiscal 2016, 43,000 restricted stock awards have been issued to various employees, directors, and consultants, which vest over the next three years, and 5,000 restricted stock awards were issued to the directors upon their election in April 2016 for a total of 48,000 year-to-date.  

- 13 -

Stock options granted prior to January 27, 2011 are governed by the applicable Prior Plan and the forms of agreement adopted thereunder.   
     
  Stock-based compensation expense reflects the fair value of stock-based awards measured at the grant date and recognized over the relevant vesting period. We estimate the fair value of each stock-based option award on the measurement date using the Black-Scholes option valuation model which incorporates assumptions as to stock price volatility, the expected life of the options, risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company s stock and other factors. The Company uses historical option exercise and termination data to estimate the expected term the options are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The expected dividend yield is calculated using historical dividend amounts and the stock price at the option issuance date. We incurred a total of $31,417 and $70,846 of stock-based compensation expense for stock options and restricted stock awards during the three and nine-months ended August 31, 2016, respectively, compared to $15,339 and $28,484 of stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock awards and stock options for the same respective periods of fiscal 2015  .     

12)    
 
   Disclosures About the Fair Value of Financial Instruments      
     
  The fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. At August 31, 2016, and November 30, 2015, the carrying amount approximated fair value for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, notes payable to bank, and other current and long-term liabilities. The carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. The fair value of the Company s installment term loans payable also approximate recorded value because the interest rates charged under the loan terms are not substantially different than current interest rates.     

13)        
 
       Segment Information      
     
  There are three reportable segments: agricultural products, modular buildings and tools. The agricultural products segment fabricates and sells farming products as well as related equipment and replacement parts for these products in the United States and worldwide. The modular buildings segment manufactures and installs modular buildings for animal containment and various laboratory uses. The tools segment manufactures steel cutting tools and inserts.  
     
  The accounting policies applied to determine the segment information are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. Management evaluates the performance of each segment based on profit or loss from operations before income taxes, exclusive of nonrecurring gains and losses.  

- 14 -

Approximate financial information with respect to the reportable segments is as follows. The tables below exclude income and balance sheet data from discontinued operations. See Note 3  Discontinued Operations.   

* Segment figures in the table may not sum to the consolidated total due to rounding.

Management evaluated all other activity of the Company and concluded that no subsequent events have occurred that would require recognition in the condensed consolidated financial statements.  

Item 2.   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   
       
   Forward-Looking Statements   
     
  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 1 of Part I of this report and the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2015. Some of the statements in this report may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our current view on future events, future business, industry and other conditions, our future performance, and our plans and expectations for future operations and actions. In some cases you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as  may,   should,   anticipate,   believe,   expect,   plan,   future,   intend,   could,   estimate,   predict,   hope,   potential,   continue,  or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. Many of these forward-looking statements are located in this report under  Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  but they may appear in other sections as well. Forward-looking statements in this report generally relate to: (i) our   expectations regarding our plan to discontinue the operations of our Vessels segment (ii) our warranty costs and order backlog; (iii) our beliefs regarding the sufficiency of working capital and cash flows, and our continued ability to renew or obtain financing on reasonable terms when necessary; (iv) the impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements; (v) our intentions and beliefs relating to our costs  , business strategies, and future performance; (vi) our expected financial results;   and (vii) our expectations concerning our primary capital and cash flow needs  .  
     
  You should read this report thoroughly with the understanding that our actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements for many reasons, including events beyond our control and assumptions that prove to be inaccurate or unfounded. We cannot provide any assurance with respect to our future performance or results. Our actual results or actions could and likely will differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements for many reasons, including but not limited to: (i) the impact of tightening credit markets on our ability to continue to obtain financing on reasonable terms; (ii) our ability to repay current debt, continue to meet debt obligations and comply with financial covenants; (iii) obstacles related to integration of acquired product lines and businesses; (iv) obstacles related to liquidation of product lines and segments (v) the effect of general economic conditions, including consumer and governmental spending, on the demand for our products and the cost of our supplies and materials; (vi) fluctuations in seasonal demand and our production cycle; and (vii) other factors described from time to time in our reports to the SEC. We do not intend to update the forward-looking statements contained in this report other than as required by law. We caution you not to put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. You should read this report and the documents that we reference in this report and have filed as exhibits completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we currently expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.

Critical Accounting Policies   
       
  Our critical accounting policies involving the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements as of August 31, 2016 have remained unchanged from November 30, 2015. Disclosure of these critical accounting policies is incorporated by reference from Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2015  .  
     
   Results of Operations   Continuing Operations   
       
   Net Sales and Cost of Sales   
       
  Our consolidated corporate sales for continuing operations for the   three and nine-month period ended August 31, 2016 were $6,431  ,000 and $17,442,000 compared to $6,514,000 and $20,605,000 during the same respective periods in 2015, a $83,000 or 1.3% decrease for the third fiscal quarter, and a $3,163,000 or 15.4% decrease year-to-date. The decreases in revenue are primarily due to the decreased demand for our agricultural products that we have been experiencing for the last year, but is somewhat offset by increases in revenues in our Scientific segment. Consolidated gross margin for the three and nine-month periods ended August 31, 2016 was 19.3% and 25.0% compared to 19.4% and 26.3% for the same respective periods in fiscal 2015.   
     
  Our third quarter sales at Manufacturing were $4,992,000 compared to $4,911,000 during the same period of 2015, an increase of $81,000, or 1.6%. Our year-to-date sales at Manufacturing were $12,757,000 compared to $16,592,000 during the same period of 2015, a decrease of $3,835,000 or 23.1%. The year-to-date revenue decrease is due to decreased demand across all of our agricultural products, including our UHC reels product which is now being produced in Armstrong after the sale of the facility in Ames, Iowa. The gross margin of our agricultural products segment for the three and nine-month periods ended August 31, 2016 was 19.0% and 24.9% compared to 18.0% and 27.2% for the same respective periods in 2015. Our decreased gross margins for the third quarter of each fiscal year is due to a larger portion of the revenues from self-propelled beet equipment, which has lower margins. Our year-to-date decreased gross margin is directly related to our decreased sales volume.   
     
  Our three and nine-month sales at Scientific were $910,000 and $3,102,000 compared to $1,103,000 and $2,162,000 for the same periods in fiscal 2015, a decrease of $193,000, or 17.5%, for the three-month period, and an increase of $940,000 or 43.5% for the nine-month period. Our increases in revenue are due to increases in our sales of our agricultural buildings, which we believe to be a result of our increased marketing in this area. Gross margin for the quarter and year-to date ended Augusts 31  , 2016 was 20.0% and 26.0% compared to 24.8% and 20.5% for the same period in 2015. The swings in gross margin are largely attributable to the changes in the timing of our revenues, which affects our variable gross margin available to cover fixed costs  .  
     
  Metals had sales of $530,000   during the three months ended August 31, 2016, compared to $500,000 for the same period in 2015, a 6.0% increase. Metals had sales of $1,583,000 during the nine months ended August 31, 2016 compared to $1,851,000 for the same period in fiscal 2015, a $268,000 decrease, or 14.5%. The decrease on a year-to-date basis are largely due to a general decline in the energy industry, but is somewhat offset by increases in our sales to other industries, and we will continue our marketing to further this goal. Gross margin was 21.1% and 23.1% for the three- and nine-month periods ending August 31, 2016, compared to 20.6% and 25.1% for the same periods of fiscal 2015, respectively. Our lower revenues and reasonably stable fixed costs affect our gross margins at Metals  .

Expenses    
     
  Our third fiscal quarter consolidated selling expenses were $456,000 compared to $508  ,000 for the same period in 2015. Our year-to-date consolidated selling expenses were $1,353,000 in 2016 compared to $1,605  ,000 for the same period in 2015.The decreases in selling expenses are largely due to decreased commission and salary expense compared to the prior year periods  . Selling expenses as a percentage of sales were 7.1% and 7.8% for the   three and nine-month periods ended August 31, 2016, compared to 7.8% and 7.8% for the same periods in 2015.  
     
  Consolidated engineering expenses were $124,000 and $315,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended August 31, 2016, compared to $128,000 and $331,000 from the same periods in 2015.   Engineering expenses as a percentage of sales were 1.9% and 1.8% for the three and nine-month period ended August 31, 2016, compared to 2.0% and 1.6% for the same periods in 2015.  
     
  Consolidated administrative expenses for the   three and nine-month periods ended August 31, 2016 were $879,000 and $2,618,000 compared to $906,000 and $2,951  ,000 for the same periods in 2015. Administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 13.7% and 15.0% for the   three and nine-month periods ended August 31, 2016, compared to 13.9% and 14.3% for the same period in 2015.  
     
   Income   from Continuing Operations   
     
  Consolidated net (loss) from continuing operations was $(150,000) for the three-month period ended August 31, 2016, compared to $(716,000) for the same period in 2015. Consolidated net income (loss) for the nine-month period ended August 31, 2016 was $1,000 compared to $(262,000) for the same period in 2015. The decreased loss from continuing operations in the three- and nine-month periods was largely due to the impairment of goodwill of $618,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, offset by the overall decreased revenues for the nine-month period.  
     
   Order Backlog   
     
  The consolidated order backlog net of discounts for continuing operations as of September 29, 2016 was $1,510,000 compared to $2,527  ,000 as of September 29, 2015. The agricultural products segment order backlog was $773,000 as of September 29, 2016 compared to $1,545  ,000 in fiscal 2015. We continue to see decreased order volume as a result of the overall downturn in the agricultural economy. The backlog for the modular buildings segment was $637,000 as of September 29, 2016, compared to $890,000 in fiscal 2015. The backlog for the tools segment was $99,000 as of September 29, 2016, compared to $92,000 in fiscal 2015. Our order backlog is not necessarily indicative of future revenue to be generated from such orders due to the possibility of order cancellations and dealer discount arrangements we may enter into from time to time.  
     
   Results of Operations   Discontinued Operations   
       
  During our third quarter of fiscal 2016  , we made the decision to exit the pressure vessels industry and are currently working to liquidate the assets. Our third fiscal quarter and year-to-date sales at Vessels were $358,000 and $1,481,000 compared to $372,000 and $1,374,000 for the same respective periods in 2015. While we do have increased sales over fiscal 2015 year to date, we do not expect any significant sales in the coming quarters. Gross margin for the quarter and year-to-date ended August 31, 2016 was (27.1%) and (0.5%) compared to 0.8% and 7.9% in 2015. Gross margin in fiscal 2016 as a whole has been affected negatively by decreased efficiencies. The efficiencies were negatively affected by large projects, training of new production staff during the beginning of the year, and more recently by loss of production staff after our announcement to discontinue operations. Our third fiscal quarter and year-to-date operating expenses at Vessels were $104,000 and $363,000 compared to $108,000 and $280,000 for the same respective periods in 2015.

Liquidity and Capital Resources   
     
  Our primary sources of funds for the nine months ended August 31, 2016 were decreases in our inventory balances and the sale of our Ames facility; our primary uses of cash were costs of operation and payments on our line of credit and payments on term debt. We expect our primary capital needs for the remainder of the fiscal year to relate to costs of operation, including production.     
     
  We have a $5,000,000 revolving line of credit with U.S. Bank, which, as of August 31, 2016  , had an outstanding principal balance of $3,434,114  . The line of credit is scheduled to mature on May 1, 2017, and is renewable annually. In addition, two of our five outstanding term loans with U.S. Bank are scheduled to mature in May of 2017, with a final payment of principal and accrued interest in the amount of $283,500 due May 10, 2017   and a final payment of principal and accrued interest in the amount of $890,000 due May 25, 2017. For additional information about our financing activities, please refer to Note 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements and to the discussion entitled  Liquidity and Capital Resources,  each contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2015, as well as Note 8 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.  
     
  We believe that our cash flows from operations and current financing arrangements will provide sufficient cash to finance operations and pay debt when due during the next twelve months. We expect to continue to rely on cash from financing activities to supplement our cash flows from operations in order to meet our liquidity and capital expenditure needs in the near future. We expect to continue to be able to procure financing upon reasonable terms; however, there is no assurance we will be able to do so.
