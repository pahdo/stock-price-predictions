Forward-Looking Statements 
  Certain matters discussed in this report, excluding historical information, as well as some statements by Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, LP and its subsidiaries ( PEPL  or the  Company ) in periodic press releases and some oral statements of Panhandle officials during presentations about the Company, include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are identified as any statement that does not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Statements using words such as  anticipate,   project,   expect,   plan,   goal,   forecast,   estimate,   intend,   continue,   believe,   may,   will  or similar expressions help identify forward-looking statements. Although the Company believes such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions and current expectations and projections about future events, no assurance can be given that such assumptions, expectations, or projections will prove to be correct. Forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of risks, uncertainties and assumptions. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect, the Company s actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, projected, forecasted, estimated or expressed in forward-looking statements since many of the factors that determine these results are subject to uncertainties and risks that are difficult to predict and beyond management s control. For additional discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, see  Part I   Item 1A. Risk Factors  in the Company s Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on   August 8, 2016  .

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Tabular dollar amounts are in millions) 
  (unaudited) 

1. 
    ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
     Organization 
  Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, LP and its subsidiaries are primarily engaged in the transportation of natural gas from the Gulf of Mexico, south Texas and the panhandle region of Texas and Oklahoma to major United States markets in the Midwest and Great Lakes regions and the storage of natural gas and are subject to the rules and regulations of the FERC.  The Company s subsidiaries are Trunkline, Sea Robin and Southwest Gas. 
  Southern Union Panhandle LLC, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of ETP, owns a   1%   general partnership interest in PEPL and ETP indirectly owns a   99%   limited partnership interest in PEPL. 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The unaudited financial information included in this Form 10-Q has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  In the opinion of the Company s management, such financial information reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and the results of operations for such interim periods in accordance with GAAP.  All intercompany items and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. 
  Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements 
  In connection with the preparation of the Form 10-Q for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company determined that, due to certain clerical errors, the state tax rate utilized to calculate the tax provision for the Company was incorrect, resulting in income tax expense being understated by   $20 million   and   $36 million   for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  As a result, the Company restated the consolidated financial statements, consolidated financial information and notes to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.  Certain amounts that were previously reported by the Company with respect to the periods presented herein have been restated.  
  The effects of the revision in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2015   are summarized in the following table: 

The effects of the revisions in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2015   are summarized in the following table:

Use of Estimates 
  The unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which includes the use of estimates and assumptions made by management that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities that exist at the date of the consolidated financial statements.  Although these estimates are based on management s available knowledge of current and expected future events, actual results could be different from those estimates. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   ( ASU 2014-09 ), which clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue based on the core principle that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09, which is now effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within those annual periods. ASU 2014-09 can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment  as of the date of adoption.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, that adopting this new accounting standard will have on our revenue recognition policies. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02  , Leases (Topic 842  ) ( ASU 2016-02 ), which establishes the principles that lessees and lessors shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from a lease. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, that adopting this new standard will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
   
           2. 
    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
     Accounts receivable from related companies reflected on the consolidated balance sheets primarily related to services provided to ETE, ETP and other affiliates.  Accounts payable to related companies reflected on the consolidated balance sheets related to various services provided by ETP and other affiliates. 
  The following table provides a summary of the related party activity included in the consolidated statements of operations: 

The Company received   $54 million   in cash distributions related to its investment in ETP during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  As discussed in Note 3, the Company settled a note receivable from a subsidiary of ETP through a non-cash distribution during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
   
           3. 
    INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES 
     The Company s investment in ETP consisted of   17.8 million   ETP common units and was accounted for using the equity method.  Effective September 1, 2015, the Company exchanged these ETP common units for a note receivable from a subsidiary of ETP in the amount of   $1.37 billion  .  The note receivable accrued interest annually at   4.75%   and was due on   September 1, 2035  . On August 31, 2016, the remaining balance of   $541 million   on the note receivable and related accrued interest from a subsidiary of ETP was settled through a non-cash distribution.

    FAIR VALUE MEASURES 
     The Company did not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .  The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities.  Based on the estimated borrowing rates currently available to the Company and its subsidiaries for loans with similar terms and average maturities, the aggregate fair value of the Company s consolidated debt obligations at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $1.14 billion   and   $1.20 billion  , respectively.  The fair value of the Company s consolidated debt obligations is a Level 2 valuation based on the observable inputs used for similar liabilities.  The Company did not have any Level 3 instruments measured at fair value at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  , and there were no transfers between hierarchy levels. 
   
           5. 
    REGULATORY MATTERS, COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES 
     Contingent Residual Support Agreement with ETP 
  The Company provides contingent, residual support to Citrus ETP Finance LLC (on a non-recourse basis to the Company) with respect to Citrus ETP Finance LLC s obligations to ETP to support the payment of   $2 billion   in principal amount of senior notes issued by ETP on January 17, 2012. 
  FERC Audit 
  In March 2016, the FERC commenced an audit of Trunkline for the period from January 1, 2013 to present to evaluate Trunkline s compliance with the requirements of its FERC gas tariff, the accounting regulations of the Uniform System of Accounts as prescribed by the FERC, and the FERC s annual reporting requirements. The audit is ongoing. 
  Environmental Matters 
  The Company s operations are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations regarding water quality, hazardous and solid waste management, air quality control and other environmental matters.  These laws, rules and regulations require the Company to conduct its operations in a specified manner and to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental regulations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals.  Failure to comply with environmental laws, rules and regulations may expose the Company to significant fines, penalties and/or interruptions in operations.  The Company s environmental policies and procedures are designed to achieve compliance with such applicable laws and regulations.  These evolving laws and regulations and claims for damages to property, employees, other persons and the environment resulting from current or past operations may result in significant expenditures and liabilities in the future.  The Company engages in a process of updating and revising its procedures for the ongoing evaluation of its operations to identify potential environmental exposures and enhance compliance with regulatory requirements. 
  The Company is responsible for environmental remediation at certain sites on its natural gas transmission systems for contamination resulting from the past use of lubricants containing PCBs in compressed air systems; the past use of paints containing PCBs; and the prior use of wastewater collection facilities and other on-site disposal areas.  The Company has implemented a program to remediate such contamination.  The primary remaining remediation activity on the Company s systems is associated with past use of paints containing PCBs or PCB impacts to equipment surfaces and to a building at one location.  The PCB assessments are ongoing and the related estimated remediation costs are subject to further change.  Other remediation typically involves the management of contaminated soils and may involve remediation of groundwater.  Activities vary with site conditions and locations, the extent and nature of the contamination, remedial requirements, complexity and sharing of responsibility.  The ultimate liability and total costs associated with these sites will depend upon many factors.  If remediation activities involve statutory joint and several liability provisions, strict liability, or cost recovery or contribution actions, the Company could potentially be held responsible for contamination caused by other parties.  In some instances, the Company may share liability associated with contamination with other potentially responsible parties.  The Company may also benefit from contractual indemnities that cover some or all of the cleanup costs.  These sites are generally managed in the normal course of business or operations. 
  The Company s environmental remediation activities are undertaken in cooperation with and under the oversight of appropriate regulatory agencies, enabling the Company under certain circumstances to take advantage of various voluntary cleanup programs in order to perform the remediation in the most effective and efficient manner.

     Table of Contents  

The table below reflects the amount of accrued liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at the dates indicated to cover environmental remediation activities where management believes a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.  The Company is not able to estimate the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued.  The Company does not have any material environmental remediation matters assessed as reasonably possible. 

Litigation and Other Claims 
  The Company is involved in legal, tax and regulatory proceedings before various courts, regulatory commissions and governmental agencies regarding matters arising in the ordinary course of business. 
  Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. New England Gas Company 
  On July 7, 2011, the Massachusetts Attorney General ( AG ) filed a regulatory complaint with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities ( MDPU ) against New England Gas Company with respect to certain environmental cost recoveries.  The AG is seeking a refund to New England Gas Company customers for alleged  excessive and imprudently incurred costs  related to legal fees associated with Southern Union s environmental response activities.  In the complaint, the AG requests that the MDPU initiate an investigation into the New England Gas Company s collection and reconciliation of recoverable environmental costs including:  (i) the prudence of any and all legal fees, totaling   $19 million  , that were charged by the Kasowitz, Benson, Torres   Friedman firm and passed through the recovery mechanism since 2005, the year when a partner in the firm, the Southern Union former Vice Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer, joined Southern Union s management team; (ii) the prudence of any and all legal fees that were charged by the Bishop, London   Dodds firm and passed through the recovery mechanism since 2005, the period during which a member of the firm served as Southern Union s Chief Ethics Officer; and (iii) the propriety and allocation of certain legal fees charged that were passed through the recovery mechanism that the AG contends only qualify for a lesser,   50%  , level of recovery.  Southern Union has filed its answer denying the allegations and moved to dismiss the complaint, in part on a theory of collateral estoppel.  The hearing officer has deferred consideration of Southern Union s motion to dismiss.  The AG s motion to be reimbursed expert and consultant costs by Southern Union of up to   $150,000   was granted.  By tariff, these costs are recoverable through rates charged to New England Gas Company customers.  The hearing officer previously stayed discovery pending resolution of a dispute concerning the applicability of attorney-client privilege to legal billing invoices.  The MDPU issued an interlocutory order on June 24, 2013 that lifted the stay, and discovery has resumed. The Company (as successor to Southern Union) believes it has complied with all applicable requirements regarding its filings for cost recovery and has not recorded any accrued liability; however, the Company will continue to assess its potential exposure for such cost recoveries as the matter progresses. 
  Liabilities for Litigation and Other Claims 
  The Company records accrued liabilities for litigation and other claim costs when management believes a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.  When management believes there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss or an additional material loss may have been incurred, the Company discloses (i) an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount accrued; or (ii) a statement that such an estimate cannot be made.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company has litigation and other claim-related accrued liabilities of   $21 million   and   $22 million  , respectively.  The Company does not have any material litigation or other claim contingency matters assessed as probable or reasonably possible that would require disclosure in the financial statements. 
  Other Commitments and Contingencies 
  The Company is subject to the laws and regulations of states and other jurisdictions concerning the identification, reporting and escheatment (the transfer of property to the state) of unclaimed or abandoned funds, and is subject to audit and examination for compliance with these requirements.  The Company is currently being examined by a third party auditor on behalf of nine states for compliance with unclaimed property laws.

Operating revenues decreased for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in the prior year due to the transfer of one of Trunkline s pipelines that was taken out of service during the third quarter of 2015 in advance of being repurposed from natural gas service to crude oil service, lower reservation revenues on the Panhandle and Trunkline pipelines due to capacity sold at lower rates and declines in production and third party maintenance on the Sea Robin Pipeline. These decreases were partially offset by higher parking revenues on the Panhandle and Trunkline pipelines.

General and administrative  .  General and administrative decreased for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in the prior year due to lower allocated costs, insurances proceeds and a refund of franchise taxes. 
  Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates  .  Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased for the   nine   months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in the prior year due to the exchange of the Company s investment in ETP for a note receivable from a subsidiary of ETP effective September 1, 2015. The earnings for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   reflects the Company s earnings related to its investment in ETP through September 1, 2015. 
  Interest Income - Affiliates.    Interest income from affiliates increased for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in the prior year due to the issuances of notes receivable with ETP and a subsidiary of ETP, effective February 2016 and September 2015, respectively.

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  Item 3, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, has been omitted from this report pursuant to the reduced disclosure format permitted by General Instruction H to Form 10-Q. 
   
  ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer ( Principal Executive Officer ) and Chief Financial Officer ( Principal Financial Officer ), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, due to the material weakness described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016. 
  In connection with the preparation of the Form 10-Q for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company determined that, due to certain clerical errors, the state tax rate utilized to calculate the tax provision for the Company was incorrect, resulting in income tax expense being understated by $20 million and $36 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and overstated by $1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. As a result, the Company restated the consolidated financial statements, consolidated financial information and notes to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The Company filed a Form 10-K/A on August 8, 2016. The errors did not impact any periods prior to January 1, 2014. 
  As a result of the item described above, the Company restated the consolidated financial statements, consolidated financial information and notes to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , included in this Form 10-Q. The impact of these errors caused a change to the Company s previously reported income tax expense (benefit) of ($28) million and $9 million for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  These clerical errors resulted from a deficiency in the procedures to review the tax models used in recording the Company s tax provision. We have concluded that such deficiency constituted a material weakness in the Company s internal controls.  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, management revised the process for reviewing the tax models used in recording the Company s tax provision. Nevertheless, the Company continues to report the above material weakness while sufficient evaluation of newly established procedures and controls occurs. Notwithstanding the material weakness, management has concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  Other than described above, there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(f) or Rule 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
