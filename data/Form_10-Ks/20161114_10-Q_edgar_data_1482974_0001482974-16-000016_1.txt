  Note 2     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    
  The summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. Such condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto are the representation of management. The accompanying condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal and recurring nature considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended   December 31, 2016  . 
  The condensed consolidated balance sheet at   December 31, 2015   has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and related notes thereto set forth in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 28, 2016.

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying   condensed consolidated   financial statements include the accounts of the Company, the Operating Partnership, all majority-owned subsidiaries and controlled subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, ASU 2015-02,   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,   which amends the current consolidation guidance affecting both the variable interest entity, or VIE, and voting interest entity, or VOE, consolidation models. The standard does not add or remove any of the characteristics in determining if an entity is a VIE or VOE, but rather enhances the way the Company assesses some of these characteristics. The Company concluded that no change was required to its accounting for its joint venture. However, the Operating Partnership now meets the criteria as a VIE, the Company is the primary beneficiary and, accordingly, the Company continues to consolidate the Operating Partnership. The Company s sole asset is its investment in the Operating Partnership, and consequently, all of the Company s assets and liabilities represent those assets and liabilities of the Operating Partnership. All of the Company s debt is an obligation of the Operating Partnership. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of the   condensed consolidated   financial statements in conformity with GAAP necessarily requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the   condensed consolidated   financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are made and evaluated on an ongoing basis using information that is currently available as well as various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Impairment of Long Lived Assets 
  The Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of its real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable, the Company assesses the recoverability of the assets by estimating whether the Company will recover the carrying value of the assets through the undiscounted future cash flows and eventual disposition. If based on this analysis the Company does not believe that it will be able to recover the carrying value of the assets, the Company will record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets.  The Company has not recognized impairment losses related to real estate. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company accelerated the amortization of one in-place lease intangible asset in the amount of   $14,634,000   as a result of one tenant experiencing financial difficulties which the Company believes will result in new lease terms. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company accelerated the amortization of one in-place lease intangible asset in the amount of   $3,121,000   as a result of one lease termination. These amounts are included as a component of depreciation and amortization expense in the accompanying   condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss)  . 
  Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts 
  Tenant receivables and unbilled deferred rent receivables are carried net of the allowances for uncollectible amounts. An allowance will be maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain tenants to meet the contractual obligations under their lease agreements. The Company also maintains an allowance for deferred rent receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents. The Company s determination of the adequacy of these allowances is based primarily upon evaluations of historical loss experience, the tenant s financial condition, security deposits, letters of credit, lease guarantees and current economic conditions and other relevant factors. For the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded   $990,000   and   $1,799,000  , respectively, in bad debt expense related to reserves for rental and parking revenue and tenant reimbursement revenue, which are recognized in the accompanying   condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss)   as a deduction from rental and parking revenue and tenant reimbursement revenue. In addition, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company wrote off   $14,366,000   related to straight-line rent receivable and   $1,146,000   related to a lease incentive asset, which are recognized in the accompanying   condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss)   as a deduction from rental and parking revenue. The bad debt expense and write offs of straight-line rent receivable and the lease incentive asset are the result of one tenant experiencing financial difficulties which the Company believes will result in new lease terms. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded   $3,376,000   in bad debt expense.

Notes Receivable 
  Notes receivable are reported at their outstanding principal balance, net of any unearned income, unamortized deferred fees and costs and allowances for doubtful accounts. The Company evaluates the collectability of both interest and principal on each note receivable to determine whether it is collectible, primarily through the evaluation of the credit quality indicators, such as the tenant's financial condition, evaluations of historical loss experience, current economic conditions and other relevant factors. Impairment occurs when it is determined probable that the Company will not be able to collect principal and interest amounts due according to the contractual terms of the note. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the aggregate balance on the Company s notes receivable was   $17,327,000   and   $13,000,000  , respectively. For the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded   $0   and   $1,625,000  , respectively, as an allowance to reduce the carrying value of a note receivable and   $42,000   and   $83,000  , respectively, recorded as a corresponding reserve related to accrued interest in provision for loan losses in the accompanying   condensed consolidated   financial statements. 
  Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Leases 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had cash on deposit, including restricted cash, in certain financial institutions that had deposits in excess of current federally insured levels; however, the Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. The Company limits its cash investments to financial institutions with high credit standings; therefore, the Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on its cash deposits. To date, the Company has experienced no loss of or lack of access to cash in its accounts. Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable from tenants is limited. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned real estate investments in   46   MSAs, (including   one   real estate investment owned through a consolidated partnership),   three   of which accounted for 10.0% or more of contractual rental revenue. Real estate investments located in   the Dallas-Ft. Worth-Arlington, Texas MSA, the Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, Illinois-Indiana-Wisconsin MSA and the Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, Texas MSA   accounted for an aggregate of   12.9%  ,   11.3%   and   10.0%  , respectively, of contractual rental revenue for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   two   exposures to tenant concentration that accounted for 10.0% or more of contractual rental revenu  e. The leases w  ith AT T Services, Inc. and the lease with Bay Area Regional Medical Center, LLC accounted for   12.2%   and   10.0%  , respectively, of contractual rental revenue for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Deferred Financing Costs 
  Deferred financing costs are loan fees, legal fees and other third-party costs associated with obtaining financing. These costs are amortized over the terms of the respective financing agreements using the effective interest method. Unamortized deferred financing costs are generally expensed when the associated debt is refinanced or repaid before maturity unless specific rules are met that would allow for the carryover of such costs to the refinanced debt. Costs incurred in seeking financing transactions that do not close are expensed in the period in which it is determined that the financing will not close. 
  On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-03,   Interest     Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,   and ASU 2015-15,   Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated With Line-of-Credit Arrangements,   or ASUs 2015-03 and 2015-15. According to ASUs 2015-03 and 2015-15, deferred financing costs related to a recognized debt liability in connection with term loans, including the term loan portion of the Company's credit facility, are presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. Deferred financing costs related to the revolving line of credit portion of the Company's unsecured credit facility are presented in the balance sheet as an asset, which is included in other assets on the   condensed consolidated   balance sheet. As required, the Company retrospectively applied the guidance in ASUs 2015-03 and 2015-15 to the prior period presented, which resulted in a decrease of   $6,805,000   in other assets,   $4,261,000   in notes payable and   $2,544,000   in credit facility on the   condensed consolidated   balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. 
  Share Repurchase Program 
  The Company s share repurchase program allows for repurchases of shares of the Company s common stock when certain criteria are met. The share repurchase program provides that all repurchases during any calendar year, including those redeemable upon death or a qualifying disability of a stockholder, are limited to those that can be funded with equivalent reinvestments pursuant to the DRIP offerings during the prior calendar year and other operating funds, if any, as the board of directors, in its sole discretion, may reserve for this purpose.

     Table of Contents  

Repurchases of shares of the Company s common stock are at the sole discretion of the Company s board of directors. In addition, the Company s board of directors, in its sole discretion, may amend, suspend, reduce, terminate or otherwise change the share repurchase program upon   30 days  ' prior notice to the Company s stockholders for any reason it deems appropriate. The share repurchase program provides that the Company will limit the number of shares repurchased during any calendar year to   5.0%   of the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31   st    of the previous calendar year. During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company received valid repurchase requests related to approximately   2,696,000   shares of common stock, all of which were repurchased in full for an aggregate purchase price of approximately   $26,146,000   (an average of   $9.70   per share). During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company received valid repurchase requests related to approximately   577,000   shares of common stock, all of which were repurchased in full for an aggregate purchase price of approximately   $5,521,000   (an average of   $9.57   per share). 
  Earnings Per Share 
  Basic earnings per share attributable to common stockholders for all periods presented are computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Shares of non-vested restricted common stock give rise to potentially dilutive shares of common stock. Diluted earnings per share are computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding and all potentially dilutive securities. For the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , there were approximately   17,000   shares of non-vested restricted common stock outstanding; however, such shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because such shares were anti-dilutive during this period. For the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  , diluted earnings per share reflected the effect of approximately   17,000   non-vested shares of restricted common stock that were outstanding as of such period. For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , diluted earnings per share reflected the effect of approximately   19,000   non-vested shares of restricted common stock that were outstanding as of such periods. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  On May 28, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , or ASU 2014-09. The objective of ASU 2014-09 is to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for GAAP. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle, which may require more judgment and estimates within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing GAAP. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) Deferral of the Effective Date  , or ASU 2015-14. ASU 2015-14 defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year to fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted as of the original effective date, which was annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and the interim periods within that year. On March 17, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),   or ASU 2016-08, which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in the new revenue recognition standard. ASU 2016-08 clarifies that an entity is a principal when it controls the specified good or service before that good or service is transferred to the customer, and is an agent when it does not control the specified good or service before it is transferred to the customer.  The effective date and transition of this update is the same as the effective date and transition of ASU 2015-14. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact ASUs 2014-09 and 2016-08 will have on the Company s   condensed consolidated   financial statements. 
  On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments-Credit Losses,   or ASU 2016-13. ASU 2016-13 requires more timely recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments that are not accounted for at fair value through net income, including loans held for investment, held-to-maturity debt securities, trade and other receivables, net investment in leases and other such commitments. ASU 2016-13 requires that financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 require the Company to measure all expected credit losses based upon historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the financial assets and eliminates the  incurred loss  methodology in current GAAP. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years, and interim periods within, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact ASU 2016-13 will have on the Company s   condensed consolidated   financial statements.

On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows  , or ASU 2016-15. ASU 2016-15 is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 addresses eight classification issues related to the statement of cash flows: 1) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; 2) settlement of zero-coupon bonds; 3) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; 4) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; 5) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies; 6) distributions received from equity method investees; 7) beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and 8) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. ASU 2016-15 is effective for public business entities for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Entities should apply this ASU using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact ASU 2016-15 will have on the Company s   condensed consolidated   financial statements. 
  Reclassifications 
  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current financial statement presentation, with no effect on the Company s   condensed consolidated   financial position or results of operations. 
   
  Note 3     Real Estate Investments 
  During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company completed the acquisition of   one   healthcare real estate investment, consisting of   five   properties, that was determined to be a business combination, or the 2016 Acquisition.

The Company funded the purchase price of the 2016 Acquisition using cash and its unsecured credit facility.  
  The following table summarizes the 2016 Acquisition: 

Results of operations for the 2016 Acquisition are reflected in the accompanying   condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss)   for   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   for the period subsequent to the acquisition date of the real estate investment. For the period from the acquisition date through   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded   $2,790,000   in revenues and a net income of   $67,000   for the 2016 Acquisition.

The total amount of all acquisition fees and costs is limited to   6.0%   of the contract purchase price of the property. The contract purchase price is the amount actually paid or allocated in respect of the purchase, development, construction or improvement of a property, exclusive of acquisition fees and acquisition expenses. For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , acquisition fees and costs did not exceed   6.0%   of the purchase price of the Company s acquisitions during such periods.

The Company pays the Advisor an annual asset management fee of   0.85%   of the aggregate asset value plus costs and expenses incurred by the Advisor in providing asset management services. The fee is payable monthly in an amount equal to   0.07083%   of the aggregate asset value as of the last day of the immediately preceding month. For the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company incurred   $5,036,000   and   $4,708,000  , respectively, and for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company incurred   $14,700,000   and   $13,274,000  , respectively, in asset management fees to the Advisor.  
  The Company reimburses the Advisor for all expenses it paid or incurred in connection with the services provided to the Company, subject to certain limitations. The Company will not reimburse the Advisor for personnel costs in connection with services for which the Advisor receives an acquisition and advisory fee or a disposition fee. For the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Advisor allocated   $511,000   and   $376,000  , respectively, and for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Advisor allocated   $1,368,000   and   $941,000  , respectively, in operating expenses incurred on the Company s behalf.  
  The Company has   no   direct employees. The employees of the Advisor and other affiliates provide services to the Company related to acquisitions, property management, asset management, accounting, investor relations, and all other administrative services. If the Advisor or its affiliates provides a substantial amount of services, as determined by a majority of the Company s independent directors, in connection with the sale of   one   or more properties, the Company will pay the Advisor a disposition fee up to the lesser of   1.0%   of the contract sales price and one-half of the brokerage commission paid if a third party broker is involved. In no event will the combined real estate commission paid to the Advisor, its affiliates and unaffiliated third parties exceed   6.0%   of the contract sales price. Notwithstanding the terms of the advisory agreement, the Advisor agreed to receive a reduced disposition fee payable to the Advisor or its affiliates in the event of a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, a sale of the Company, or a merger with a change of control of the Company, of up to the lesser of   50%   of the fees paid in the aggregate to third party investment bankers for such transaction, not to exceed   0.50%   of the transaction price. The disposition fee is otherwise payable in accordance with the advisory agreement. This reduction in the disposition fee would not impact a disposition fee paid in the event of a sale of an individual property or portfolio of properties. The reduced disposition fee in such situations was approved by the Company's board of directors on May 5, 2016. In addition, after investors have received a return on their net capital contributions and an   8.0%   cumulative non-compounded annual return, then the Advisor is entitled to receive   15.0%   of the remaining net sale proceeds. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has not incurred a disposition fee or a subordinated participation in net sale proceeds to the Advisor or its affiliates.

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has not incurred a subordinated incentive listing fee. 
  Upon termination or non-renewal of the advisory agreement, with or without cause, the Advisor will be entitled to receive distributions from the Operating Partnership equal to   15.0%   of the amount by which the sum of the Company s adjusted market value plus distributions exceeds the sum of the aggregate capital contributed by investors plus an amount equal to an annual   8.0%   cumulative, non-compounded return to investors. In addition, the Advisor may elect to defer its right to receive a subordinated distribution upon termination until either shares of the Company s common stock are listed and traded on a national securities exchange or another liquidity event occurs. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has not incurred any subordinated termination fees to the Advisor or its affiliates.

The Property Manager and its affiliates may subcontract the performance of their duties to third parties and pay all or a portion of the property management fee to the third parties with whom they contract for these services. If the Company contracts directly with third parties for such services at customary market fees, the Company may pay the Property Manager an oversight fee equal to   1.0%   of the gross revenues of the property managed. In no event will the Company pay the Property Manager, the Advisor or its affiliates both a property management fee and an oversight fee with respect to any particular property. The Company will pay the Property Manager a separate fee for the one-time initial rent-up, lease renewals or leasing-up of newly constructed properties.

Note 11     Segment Reporting    
  Management reviews the performance of individual properties and aggregates individual properties based on operating criteria into two reportable segments commercial real estate investments in data centers and healthcare and makes operating decisions based on these   two   reportable segments. The Company s commercial real estate investments in data centers and healthcare are based on certain underwriting assumptions and operating criteria, which are different for data centers and healthcare. There were   no   intersegment sales or transfers during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  The Company evaluates performance based on net operating income of the individual properties in each segment. Net operating income, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as total revenues, less rental expenses, which excludes depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, acquisition related expenses, asset management fees, change in fair value of contingent consideration, interest expense, net, loss on debt extinguishment, provision for loan losses, and other interest and dividend income. The Company believes that segment net operating income serves as a useful supplement to net income because it allows investors and management to measure unlevered property-level operating results and to compare operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies between periods on a consistent basis. Segment net operating income should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of financial performance, and accordingly, the Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results, segment net operating income should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the accompanying   condensed consolidated   financial statements and data included elsewhere in this   Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q  . 
  Real estate-related notes receivable interest income, general and administrative expenses, change in fair value of contingent consideration, acquisition related expenses, asset management fees, depreciation and amortization, provision for loan losses, other interest and dividend income and interest expense, net are not allocated to individual segments for purposes of assessing segment performance.

Note 13     Preferred Equity Investment    
  During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company invested an aggregate amount of   $127,147,000   in   7.875%   Series B Redeemable Cumulative Preferred Stock in a private healthcare real estate corporation, or the Preferred Equity Investment. The Preferred Equity Investment is stated at cost and consisted of a principal amount of   $125,000,000  , plus origination costs of   $2,772,000  , offset by closing fees of   $625,000  . For the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recognized   $2,461,000   and   $2,461,000  , respectively, and for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recognized   $7,383,000   and   $5,359,000  , respectively, of dividend income related to the Preferred Equity Investment. On October 4, 2016, the Company received proceeds for the redemption of the Preferred Equity Investment in   7.875%   Series B Redeemable Cumulative Preferred Stock for a total of approximately   $131,250,000  . Refer to Note 14  Fair Value  for further discussion. 
   
  Note 14     Fair Value    
  Notes payable   Fixed Rate   The estimated fair value of notes payable   fixed rate measured using quoted prices and observable inputs from similar liabilities (Level 2) was approximately   $118,865,000   and   $131,984,000   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, as compared to the outstanding principal of   $115,481,000   and   $131,233,000   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

     Table of Contents  

Notes payable   Variable   The estimated fair value of notes payable   variable rate fixed through interest rate swap agreements (Level 2) was approximately   $332,952,000   and   $364,478,000   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, as compared to the outstanding principal of   $332,199,000   and   $369,002,000   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The outstanding principal of the notes payable   variable was   $41,977,000   and   $43,097,000   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which approximated their fair value because they are interest rate adjustable. 
  Unsecured credit facility   The outstanding principal of the unsecured credit facility   variable was   $268,000,000   and   $238,000,000  , which approximated its fair value, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The interest on the unsecured credit facility   variable is calculated at LIBOR, plus an applicable margin. The interest rate resets to market on a monthly basis. The fair value of the Company's unsecured credit facility   variable is estimated based on the interest rates currently offered to the Company by financial institutions. The estimated fair value of the unsecured credit facility   variable rate fixed through interest rate swap agreements (Level 2) was approximately   $207,750,000   and   $52,054,000   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, as compared to the outstanding principal of   $210,000,000   and   $55,000,000   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Notes receivable   The outstanding principal of the notes receivable approximated the fair value as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The fair value of the Company s notes receivable is estimated using significant unobservable inputs not based on market activity, but rather through particular valuation techniques (Level 3). The fair value was measured based on the income approach valuation methodology, which requires certain judgments to be made by management. 
  Contingent consideration   The Company has a contingent obligation to pay a former owner in conjunction with a certain acquisition if specified future operational objectives are met over future reporting periods. Liabilities for contingent consideration will be measured at fair value each reporting period, with the acquisition-date fair value included as part of the consideration transferred, and subsequent changes in fair value recorded in earnings as change in fair value of contingent consideration. 
  The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration was   $5,710,000   and   $5,340,000   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which is reported in the accompanying   condensed consolidated balance sheets   in accounts payable and other liabilities. The Company uses an income approach to value the contingent consideration liability, which is determined based on the present value of probability-weighted future cash flows. The Company has classified the contingent consideration liability as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy due to the lack of relevant observable market data over fair value inputs such as probability-weighting for payment outcomes. Increases in the assessed likelihood of a high payout under a contingent consideration arrangement contributes to increases in the fair value of the related liability. Conversely, decreases in the assessed likelihood of a higher payout under a contingent consideration arrangement contributes to decreases in the fair value of the related liability. Changes in assumptions could have an impact on the payout of the contingent consideration arrangement with a maximum payout of   $8,450,000   and a minimum payout of   $0   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Derivative instruments   Considerable judgment is necessary to develop estimated fair values of financial instruments. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amount the Company could realize, or be liable for, on disposition of the financial instruments. The Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its interest rate swaps fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The credit valuation adjustments associated with these instruments utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and the respective counterparty. However, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions, and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its interest rate swaps. As a result, the Company determined that its interest rate swaps valuation in its entirety is classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  Preferred Equity Investment   The carrying value of the Preferred Equity Investment was   $127,147,000  , as compared to its fair value of   $131,250,000   and   $127,147,000  , respectively, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The fair value of the Preferred Equity Investment was determined based on proceeds received from a redemption of the Preferred Equity Investment on October 4, 2016.

Note 15     Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities    
  Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
  The Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish these objectives, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. 
  The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated, and that qualify, as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying   condensed consolidated statement of stockholders' equity   and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with variable rate debt. The ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings. During the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  ,   no   income or losses were recognized due to ineffectiveness of hedges of interest rate risk. During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company accelerated the reclassification of amounts in other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings as a result of a hedged forecasted transaction becoming probable not to occur due to a related debt extinguishment. The accelerated amount was a loss of   $728,000  . During the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  ,   no   income or losses were recognized due to ineffectiveness of hedges of interest rate risk. 
  Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s variable rate debt. During the next twelve months, the Company estimates that an additional   $3,178,000   will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss as an increase to interest expense. 
  See   Note 14 "Fair Value"   for a further discussion of the fair value of the Company s derivative instruments. 
  The following table summarizes the notional amount and fair value of the Company s derivative instruments (amounts in thousands): 

The notional amount under the agreements is an indication of the extent of the Company s involvement in each instrument at the time, but does not represent exposure to credit, interest rate or market risks. 
  Accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use and designation of the derivative instrument. The Company designated the interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of the anticipated cash flows on its variable rate notes payable. The change in fair value of the effective portion of the derivative instrument that is designated as a hedge is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), or OCI, in the accompanying   condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss)  .

The table below summarizes the amount of income and loss recognized on interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (amounts in thousands): 

Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features 
  The Company has agreements with each of its derivative counterparties that contain cross-default provisions, whereby if the Company defaults on certain of its unsecured indebtedness, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations, resulting in an acceleration of payment thereunder. 
  In addition, the Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by its derivative counterparties. The Company believes it mitigates its credit risk by entering into agreements with creditworthy counterparties. The Company records credit risk valuation adjustments on its interest rate swaps based on the respective credit quality of the Company and the counterparty. As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of derivatives in a net liability position, including accrued interest but excluding any adjustment for nonperformance risk related to these agreements, was   $6,348,000  . As of   September 30, 2016  , there was one termination event related to an early interest rate swap termination and no events of default related to the interest rate swaps.

  Overview 
  We were formed on December 16, 2009 under the laws of Maryland to acquire and operate a diversified portfolio of income-producing commercial real estate in data centers and healthcare. We may also invest in real estate-related investments that relate to such property types. We qualified and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, for federal income tax purposes. 
  On June 6, 2014, we terminated our initial public offering of up to $1,746,875,000 shares of common stock, or our Offering.   On November 25, 2015, we registered an additional 10,473,946 shares of common stock with a price per share of $9.5475 for a proposed maximum offering price of $100,000,000 in shares of common stock under the distribution reinvestment plan, or the DRIP, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3, or the Second DRIP Offering. The Second DRIP Offering includes shares of common stock previously registered under the DRIP pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3, or the First DRIP Offering, that the Company carried forward in the Second DRIP Offering. We refer to the First DRIP Offering and the Second DRIP Offering as the DRIP Offerings, and collectively with our Offering, our Offerings.   We will continue to issue shares of common stock under the Second DRIP Offering until such time as we sell all of the shares registered for sale under the Second DRIP Offering, unless we file a new registration statement with the SEC or the Second DRIP Offering is terminated by our board of directors. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had issued approximately   188,025,000   shares of common stock in our Offerings for gross proceeds of   $1,862,909,000  , before share repurchases of   $40,673,000   and offering costs, selling commissions and dealer manager fees of   $174,783,000  .

     Table of Contents  

On November 16, 2015, our board of directors established an estimated value of our common stock, or NAV per share, calculated as of September 30, 2015, of $10.05 per share for purposes of assisting broker-dealers that participated in our Offering in meeting their customer account statement reporting obligations under the National Association of Securities Dealers Conduct Rule 2340. We intend to publish an updated estimated NAV per share on at least an annual basis. The purchase price per share in the Second DRIP Offering is equal to 95% of $10.05, or $9.5475. 
  Substantially all of our operations are conducted through Carter/Validus Operating Partnership, LP, or our Operating Partnership. We are externally advised by Carter/Validus Advisors, LLC, or our Advisor, pursuant to an advisory agreement between us and our Advisor, which is our affiliate. Our Advisor supervises and manages our day-to-day operations and selects the properties and real estate-related investments we acquire, subject to the oversight and approval of our board of directors. Our Advisor also provides marketing, sales and client services on our behalf. Our Advisor engages affiliated entities to provide various services to us. Our Advisor is managed by, and is a subsidiary of our sponsor, Carter/Validus REIT Investment Management Company, LLC, or our Sponsor. We have no paid employees and rely upon our Advisor to provide substantially all of our services. 
  Carter Validus Real Estate Management Services, LLC, or our Property Manager, a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Sponsor, serves as our property manager. Our Advisor and our Property Manager received, and will continue to receive, fees during our acquisition and operational stages and our Advisor may be eligible to receive fees during the liquidation stage of the Company. 
  We currently operate through two reportable segments   commercial real estate investments in data centers and healthcare. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had completed acquisitions of   49   real estate investments (including   one     real estate investment owned through a consolidated partnership  ) consisting of   84   properties, comprised of 94 buildings and parking facilities and approximately 6,160,000 square feet of gross rentable area (excluding parking facilities), for an aggregate purchase price of   $2,189,062,000  .  
  Critical Accounting Policies

  Interim Unaudited Financial Data 
  Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by us in accordance with GAAP in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the SEC. Certain information and footnote disclosures required for annual financial statements have been condensed or excluded pursuant to SEC rules and regulations. Accordingly, our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are, in our view, of a normal recurring nature and necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim period. Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year; such full year results may be less favorable. Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  Qualification as a REIT 
  We qualified and elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and we intend to continue to be taxed as a REIT. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must continue to meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to currently distribute at least 90.0% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. 
  If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT in any taxable year, we would then be subject to federal income taxes on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and would not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost unless the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders.

The following discussion is based on our   condensed consolidated   financial statements for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  This section describes and compares our results of operations for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . We generate almost all of our net operating income from property operations. In order to evaluate our overall portfolio, management analyzes the net operating income of same store properties.   We define "same store properties" as operating properties that were owned and operated for the entirety of both calendar periods being compared and exclude properties under development. 
  By evaluating the property net operating income of our same store properties, management is able to monitor the operations of our existing properties for comparable periods to measure the performance of our current portfolio and determine the effects of our new acquisitions on net income. 
  We are not aware of any material trends and uncertainties, other than national economic conditions affecting real estate generally, that may be reasonably expected to have a material impact, favorable or unfavorable, on revenues or incomes from the acquisition, management and operation of properties other than those set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and in Part II, Item 1A.

    The Company had a loss on debt extinguishment for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   due to the associated early extinguishment of one hedged debt obligation. 
                
    Provision for loan losses increased due to a $1.7 million reserve of one note receivable.

Organization and Offering Costs 
  Prior to the termination of our Offering on June 6, 2014, we reimbursed our Advisor or its affiliates for organization and offering costs it incurred on our behalf, but only to the extent the reimbursement did not cause the selling commissions, dealer manager fees and the other organization and offering costs incurred by us to exceed 15% of gross offering proceeds as of the date of the reimbursement. Since inception and through the termination of our Offering on June 6, 2014, we paid approximately $156,519,000 in selling commissions and dealer manager fees to SC Distributors, LLC, or our Dealer Manager, which is an affiliate of our Advisor, we reimbursed our Advisor or its affiliates approximately $14,207,000 in offering expenses, and incurred approximately $3,900,000 of other organization and offering costs, which totaled approximately $174,626,000, or 10.2%, of total gross offering proceeds, which were approximately $1,716,046,000. 
  Subsequent to the termination of our Offering and as of   September 30, 2016  , we had incurred approximately   $157,000   in other offering costs related to the DRIP Offerings. 
  Other organization costs were expensed as incurred and selling commissions and dealer manager fees were charged to stockholders  equity as the amounts related to raising capital. For a further discussion of other organization and offering costs, see   Note 10 "Related-Party Transactions and Arrangements"   to the   condensed consolidated   financial statements that are a part of this   Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q  . 
  Preferred Equity Investment 
  During the year ended December 31, 2015, we invested an aggregate amount of   $127,147,000   in   7.875%   Series B Redeemable Cumulative Preferred Stock in a private healthcare real estate corporation. Our Preferred Equity Investment is stated at cost and consisted of a principal amount of   $125,000,000  , plus origination costs of   $2,772,000  , offset by closing fees of   $625,000  . On October 4, 2016, we received proceeds for the redemption of the Preferred Equity Investment for a total of $131,250,000. 
  Inflation 
  We are exposed to inflation risk as income from long-term leases is the primary source of our cash flows from operations. There are provisions in certain of our leases, with tenants, that are intended to protect us from, and mitigate the risk of, the impact of inflation. These provisions include scheduled increases in contractual base rent receipts, reimbursement billings for operating expenses, pass-through charges and real estate tax and insurance reimbursements. However, due to the long-term nature of our leases, among other factors, the leases may not reset frequently enough to adequately offset the effects of inflation. 
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our principal demands for funds are for real estate and real estate-related investments, the payment of acquisition related costs, capital expenditures, operating expenses, distributions and repurchases to stockholders and principal and interest on any current and any future indebtedness. Generally, cash needs for items other than acquisitions and acquisition related costs will be generated from operations of our current and future investments. We expect to utilize funds equal to amounts reinvested in the DRIP Offerings and future proceeds from secured and unsecured financings to complete future real estate-related investments. As our Offering terminated on June 6, 2014, we expect to meet future cash needs for real estate-related investments from cash flows from operations, funds equal to amounts reinvested in the DRIP Offerings and debt financings. In addition, cash paid for distributions will be reduced due to the DRIP Offerings. The sources of our operating cash flows will be primarily provided by the rental income received from current and future tenants of our leased properties. 
  We are required by the terms of applicable loan documents to meet certain financial covenants, such as coverage ratios and reporting requirements. In addition, certain loan agreements include cross-default provisions to financial covenants in lease agreements with our tenants so that a default in the financial covenant in the lease agreement is a default in our loan. We were in compliance with all financial covenant requirements as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  In the event we are not in compliance with these covenants in future periods and are unable to obtain a consent or waiver, the lender may choose to pursue remedies under the respective loan agreements, which could include, at the lender's discretion, declaring the loans to be immediately due and payable and payment of termination fees and costs incurred by the lender, among other potential remedies.

Short-term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  On a short-term basis, our principal demands for funds will be for the acquisition of real estate and real estate-related notes and investments and the payment of tenant improvements, acquisition related costs, operating expenses, distributions, and interest and principal payments on current and future debt financings. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through net cash flows provided by operations, borrowings on our unsecured credit facility, as well as secured and unsecured borrowings from banks and other lenders to finance our expected future acquisitions. 
  Long-term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  On a long-term basis, our principal demands for funds will be for the acquisition of real estate and real estate-related investments and payments of tenant improvements, acquisition related costs, operating expenses, distributions and repurchases to stockholders, and interest and principal payments on current and future indebtedness. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through proceeds from cash flow from operations, borrowings on our unsecured credit facility and proceeds from secured or unsecured borrowings from banks or other lenders. 
  We expect that substantially all cash flows from operations will be used to pay distributions to our stockholders after certain capital expenditures; however, we have used, and may continue to use other sources to fund distributions, as necessary, such as funds equal to amounts reinvested in the DRIP Offerings, borrowing on our unsecured credit facility and/or future borrowings on unencumbered assets. To the extent cash flows from operations are lower due to fewer properties being acquired or lower-than-expected returns on the properties held, distributions paid to stockholders may be lower. We expect that substantially all net cash flows from debt financings will be used to fund acquisitions, certain capital expenditures identified at acquisition, repayments of outstanding debt or distributions to our stockholders in excess of cash flows from operations. 
  Capital Expenditures 
  We estimate that we will require approximately   $30.4 million   in expenditures for capital improvements over the next 12 months. We cannot provide assurances, however, that actual expenditures will not exceed these estimated expenditure levels. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had $2.2 million of restricted cash in lender-controlled escrow reserve accounts for such capital expenditures. In addition, as of   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately   $41.4 million   in cash and cash equivalents. For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we had capital expenditures of   $55.1 million   that primarily related to two healthcare real estate investments and one data center real estate investment. 
  Unsecured Credit Facility 
  The proceeds of loans made under the unsecured credit facility may be used to finance the acquisition of real estate investments, for tenant improvements and leasing commissions with respect to real estate, for repayment of indebtedness, for capital expenditures with respect to real estate and for general corporate and working capital purposes. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a total unencumbered pool availability under the unsecured credit facility of   $514,575,000   and an aggregate outstanding principal balance of   $478,000,000  . As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $36,575,000   remained available to be drawn under the unsecured credit facility.

Cash Flows 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Operating Activities. 
             
    Net cash provided by operating activities increased due to annual rental increases at our same store properties and the acquisition of five operating properties and placing one property in service subsequent to September 30, 2015, partially offset by increased operating expenses. 
     Investing Activities. 
             
    Net cash used in investing activities decreased due to a decrease in investments in real estate of $52.8 million, an     increase in real estate deposits, net of $0.3 million, a decrease in real estate-related notes receivable advances of $0.2 million, a decrease in notes receivable advances of $7.0 million, and no additions to our preferred equity investment of $127.1 million, offset by an increase in capital expenditures of $10.9 million and a decrease of $9.5 million in collections of real estate-related notes receivable. 
     Financing Activities. 
             
    Net cash provided by financing activities decreased due to a decrease in draws on our unsecured credit facility of $50.0 million, a decrease in proceeds from notes payable of $64.3 million, an increase in payments on notes payable of $45.1 million, an increase in repurchases of our common stock of $20.6 million, an increase in distributions to our stockholders of $2.4 million, and an increase in use of escrow funds of $2.0 million, offset by a decrease in payments of deferred financing costs of $2.0 million, decrease in purchase of noncontrolling interests of $67.2 million, a decrease in distributions to noncontrolling interests of $0.1 million, a decrease in payments of offering costs of $0.1 million and a decrease in payments on our unsecured credit facility of $27.0 million.

Distributions 
  The amount of distributions payable to our stockholders is determined by our board of directors and is dependent on a number of factors, including funds available for distribution, financial condition, capital expenditure requirements and annual distribution requirements needed to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code. To the extent that funds are available, we intend to continue to pay monthly distributions to stockholders. Our board of directors must authorize each distribution and may, in the future, authorize lower amounts of distributions or not authorize additional distributions and, therefore, distribution payments are not assured. Our Advisor may also defer, suspend and/or waive fees and expense reimbursements if we have not generated sufficient cash flow from our operations and other sources to fund distributions. Additionally, our organizational documents permit us to pay distributions from unlimited amounts of any source, and we may use sources other than operating cash flows to fund distributions, including funds equal to amounts reinvested in the DRIP Offerings, which may reduce the amount of capital we ultimately invest in properties or other permitted investments. 
  We have funded distributions with operating cash flows from our properties, offering proceeds raised in our Offering and funds equal to amounts reinvested in the DRIP Offerings. To the extent that we do not have taxable income, distributions paid will be considered a return of capital to stockholders. The following table shows distributions paid during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(1) 
    Percentages were calculated by dividing the respective source amount by the total sources of distributions. 
     Total distributions declared but not paid as of   September 30, 2016   were   $10.6 million   for common stockholders. These distributions were paid on   October 3, 2016  . 
  For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we paid and declared distributions of approximately   $96.0 million   to common stockholders including shares issued pursuant to the DRIP Offerings, as compared to FFO (as defined below) for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   of   $88.3 million  . The payment of distributions from sources other than FFO may reduce the amount of proceeds available for investment and operations or cause us to incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds. 
  For a discussion of distributions paid subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , see   Note 17 "Subsequent Events"   to the   condensed consolidated   financial statements included in this   Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q  .

Contractual Obligations 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately   $967,657,000   of principal debt outstanding, of which   $489,657,000   related to notes payable and   $478,000,000   related to the unsecured credit facility. See   Note 7 "Notes Payable and Unsecured Credit Facility"   to the   condensed consolidated   financial statements that are a part of this   Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q   for certain terms of the debt outstanding. Our contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016   were as follows (amounts in thousands): 

(1) 
    As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $542.2 million   outstanding principal on notes payable and borrowings under the unsecured credit facility that were fixed through the use of interest rate swap agreements. 
              (2) 
    We used the fixed rates under our interest rate swap agreements as of   September 30, 2016   to calculate the debt payment obligations in future periods. 
               (4) 
    Of this amount,   $268,000,000   relates to the revolving line of credit under the unsecured credit facility. The maturity date on the revolving line of credit under the unsecured credit facility is   May 28, 2017  , subject to our right to a   12  -month extension. 
              (5) 
    Contingent consideration represents our best estimate of the cash payments we will be obligated to make under contingent consideration arrangements with a former owner of a property we acquired if specified objectives are achieved by the acquired entity.   Changes in assumptions could have an impact on the payout of contingent consideration arrangements with a maximum payout of   $8.5 million   and a minimum payout of   $0   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 
  Related-Party Transactions and Arrangements 
  We have entered into agreements with our Advisor and its affiliates, whereby we agree to pay certain fees to, or reimburse certain expenses of, our Advisor or its affiliates for acquisition fees and expenses, organization and offering expenses, asset and property management fees and reimbursement of operating costs. Refer to   Note 10 "Related-Party Transactions and Arrangements"   to our   condensed consolidated   financial statements that are a part of this   Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q   for a detailed discussion of the various related-party transactions and agreements.

Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations 
  One of our objectives is to provide cash distributions to our stockholders from cash generated by our operations. The purchase of real estate assets and real estate-related investments, and the corresponding expenses associated with that process, is a key operational feature of our business plan in order to generate cash from operations. Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, an industry trade group, has promulgated a measure known as funds from operations, or FFO, which we believe is an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure. FFO is not equivalent to our net income as determined under GAAP. 
  We define FFO, consistent with NAREIT s definition, as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property and asset impairment write-downs, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnership and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. 
  We, along with others in the real estate industry, consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a REIT s operating performance because it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that excludes non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization and asset impairment write-downs, which we believe provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to our management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy. 
  Historical accounting convention (in accordance with GAAP) for real estate assets requires companies to report its investment in real estate at its carrying value, which consists of capitalizing the cost of acquisitions, development, construction, improvements and significant replacements, less depreciation and amortization and asset impairment write-downs, if any, which is not necessarily equivalent to the fair market value of its investment in real estate assets. 
  The historical accounting convention requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, which could be the case if such assets are not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant circumstances and/or as requested or required by lessees for operational purposes in order to maintain the value disclosed. We believe that, since the fair value of real estate assets historically rises and falls with market conditions including, but not limited to, inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation could be less informative. 
  In addition, we believe it is appropriate to disregard asset impairment write-downs as they are a non-cash adjustment to recognize losses on prospective sales of real estate assets. Since losses from sales of real estate assets are excluded from FFO, we believe it is appropriate that asset impairment write-downs in advancement of realization of losses should be excluded. Impairment write-downs are based on negative market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions, which are independent of our operating performance, including, but not limited to, a significant adverse change in the financial condition of our tenants, changes in supply and demand for similar or competing properties, changes in tax, real estate, environmental and zoning law, which can change over time. When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of real estate and related assets may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability by estimating whether we will recover the carrying value of the asset through undiscounted future cash flows and eventual disposition (including, but not limited to, net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of property and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP). If based on this analysis, we do not believe that we will be able to recover the carrying value of the real estate asset, we will record an impairment write-down to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the real estate asset. Testing for indicators of impairment is a continuous process and is analyzed on a quarterly basis. Investors should note, however, that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance, because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows, are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and that we intend to have a relatively limited term of our operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges through the eventual sale of the property. No impairment losses have been recorded to date. 
  In developing estimates of expected future cash flow, we make certain assumptions regarding future market rental income amounts subsequent to the expiration of current lease arrangements, property operating expenses, terminal capitalization and discount rates, the expected number of months it takes to re-lease the property, required tenant improvements and the number of years the property will be held for investment. The use of alternative assumptions in the future cash flow analysis could result in a different determination of the property s future cash flows and a different conclusion regarding the existence of an asset impairment, the extent of such loss, if any, as well as the carrying value of the real estate asset.

Publicly registered, non-listed REITs, such as us, typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operations. While other start-up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, we believe that publicly registered, non-listed REITs are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases. We will use cash flows from operations and debt financings to acquire real estate assets and real estate-related investments, and we intend to begin the process of achieving a liquidity event (i.e., listing of our shares of common stock on a national securities exchange, a merger or sale, the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or another similar transaction) within five years after the completion of our offering stage, which is generally comparable to other publicly registered, non-listed REITs. Thus, we do not intend to continuously purchase real estate assets and intend to have a limited life. Due to these factors and other unique features of publicly registered, non-listed REITs, the Investment Program Association, or the IPA, an industry trade group, has standardized a measure known as modified funds from operations, or MFFO, which we believe to be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a publicly registered, non-listed REIT. MFFO is a metric used by management to evaluate sustainable performance and dividend policy. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income as determined under GAAP. 
  We define MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the IPA s definition: FFO further adjusted for the following items included in the determination of GAAP net income; acquisition fees and expenses; amounts related to straight-line rental income and amortization of above and below intangible lease assets and liabilities; accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income; nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, adjustments related to contingent purchase price obligations where such adjustments have been included in the derivation of GAAP net income, and after adjustments for a consolidated and unconsolidated partnership and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. Our MFFO calculation complies with the IPA s Practice Guideline, described above. In calculating MFFO, we exclude paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses that are reported in our   condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss)  , amortization of above and below-market leases, adjustments related to contingent purchase price obligations, gains or losses from the extinguishment of debt and hedges, amounts related to straight-line rents (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to closer to an expected to be received cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments); and the adjustments of such items related to noncontrolling interests in our Operating Partnership. The other adjustments included in the IPA s guidelines are not applicable to us. 
  Since MFFO excludes acquisition fees and expenses, it should not be construed as a historic performance measure. Acquisition fees and expenses are paid in cash by us, and we have not set aside or put into escrow any specific amount of proceeds from our offerings to be used to fund acquisition fees and expenses. Acquisition fees and expenses include payments to our Advisor or its affiliates and third parties. Such fees and expenses will not be reimbursed by our Advisor or its affiliates and third parties, and therefore if there are no further proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock to fund future acquisition fees and expenses, such fees and expenses will need to be paid from either additional debt, operational earnings or cash flows, net proceeds from the sale of properties, or from ancillary cash flows. As a result, the amount of proceeds available for investment and operations would be reduced, or we may incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds. Nevertheless, our Advisor or its affiliates will not accrue any claim on our assets if acquisition fees and expenses are not paid from the proceeds of our offerings. Under GAAP, acquisition fees and expenses related to the acquisition of properties determined to be business combinations are expensed as incurred, including investment transactions that are no longer under consideration, and are included in acquisition related expenses in the accompanying   condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss)   and acquisition fees and expenses associated with transactions determined to be an asset purchase are capitalized. 
  All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the real estate asset, these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property. In addition, MFFO may not be an indicator of our operating performance, especially during periods in which properties are being acquired. 
  In addition, certain contemplated non-cash fair value and other non-cash adjustments are considered operating non-cash adjustments to net income in determining cash flows from operations in accordance with GAAP.

     Table of Contents  

We use MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it in order to evaluate our performance against other publicly registered, non-listed REITs, which intend to have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies shortly thereafter. As noted above, MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance if we do not continue to operate in this manner. We believe that our use of MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it allow us to present our performance in a manner that reflects certain characteristics that are unique to publicly registered, non-listed REITs, such as their limited life, limited and defined acquisition period and targeted exit strategy, and hence the use of such measures may be useful to investors. For example, acquisition fees and expenses are intended to be funded from the proceeds of our offering and other financing sources and not from operations. By excluding acquisition fees and expenses, the use of MFFO provides information consistent with management s analysis of the operating performance of its real estate assets. Additionally, fair value adjustments, which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions, but can also result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates, may not be directly related or attributable to our current operating performance. By excluding such charges that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gains or losses, we believe MFFO provides useful supplemental information. 
  Presentation of this information is intended to assist management and investors in comparing the operating performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO and MFFO the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance, as an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other measurements as an indication of our performance. MFFO has limitations as a performance measure in an offering such as ours where the price of a share of common stock is stated value and there is no asset value determination during the offering stage and for a period thereafter. MFFO may be useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability of operating performance in future operating periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition stages are complete and net asset value is disclosed. MFFO is not a useful measure in evaluating net asset value since impairment write-downs are taken into account in determining net asset value but not in determining MFFO. 
  FFO and MFFO, as described above, should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operational performance. The method used to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operating performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP FFO and MFFO measures and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO. MFFO has not been scrutinized to the level of other similar non-GAAP performance measures by the SEC or any other regulatory body.

The following is a reconciliation of net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to FFO and MFFO for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (amounts in thousands, except share data and per share amounts): 

(1) 
    In evaluating investments in real estate assets, management differentiates the costs to acquire the investment from the operations derived from the investment. Such information would be comparable only for publicly registered, non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisitions activities and have other similar operating characteristics. By excluding expensed acquisition related expenses, management believes MFFO provides useful supplemental information that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management s analysis of the investing and operating performance of our properties. Acquisition fees and expenses include payments in cash to our Advisor and third parties. Acquisition fees and expenses incurred in a business combination, under GAAP, are considered operating expenses and as expenses are included in the determination of net income, which is a performance measure under GAAP. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to the property. 
              (2) 
    Under GAAP, certain intangibles are accounted for at cost and reviewed at least annually for impairment, and certain intangibles are assumed to diminish predictably in value over time and are amortized, similar to depreciation and amortization of real estate-related assets that are excluded from FFO. However, because real estate values and market lease rates historically rise or fall with market conditions, management believes that by excluding charges related to amortization of these intangibles, MFFO provides useful supplemental information on the performance of the real estate. 
              (3) 
    Under GAAP, rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related lease (including rent holidays if applicable). This may result in income recognition that is significantly different than the underlying contract terms. By adjusting for the change in deferred rent receivables, MFFO may provide useful supplemental information on the realized economic impact of lease terms, providing insight on the expected contractual cash flows of such lease terms, and aligns with our analysis of operating performance.

    Subsequent to the filing of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2015, we updated FFO and MFFO calculations to reflect an adjustment for depreciation and amortization related to the full amortization of lease intangibles associated with a lease termination. This resulted in additional positive impact to FFO and MFFO in the amount of $3,121,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
  Market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. In pursuing our business plan, the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk. 
  We have obtained variable rate debt financing to fund certain property acquisitions, and we are exposed to changes in the one-month LIBOR. Our objectives in managing interest rate risk seek to limit the impact of interest rate changes on operations and cash flows, and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we will borrow primarily at interest rates with the lowest margins available and, in some cases, with the ability to convert variable interest rates to fixed rates. 
  We have entered, and may continue to enter, into derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a given variable rate financial instrument. To the extent we do, we are exposed to credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes us, which creates credit risk for us. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, we owe the counterparty and, therefore, it does not possess credit risk. Market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in interest rates. We manage the market risk associated with interest rate contracts by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. We have not entered, and do not intend to enter, into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. We may also enter into rate-lock arrangements to lock interest rates on future borrowings. 
  The following table summarizes our principal debt outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   (amounts in thousands):  

As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $310.0 million   of the   $967.7 million   total principal debt outstanding was subject to variable interest rates with a weighted average interest rate of 2.8% per annum. As of   September 30, 2016  , an increase of 50 basis points in the market rates of interest would have resulted in a change in interest expense of $1.5 million per year. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had 18 interest rate swap agreements outstanding, which mature on various dates from   October 2017   through   August 2020  , with an aggregate notional amount under the swap agreements of   $542.2 million   and an aggregate settlement liability value of $6.3 million. The settlement value of these interest rate swap agreements is dependent upon existing market interest rates and swap spreads. As of   September 30, 2016  , an increase of 50 basis points in the market rates of interest would have resulted in a decrease to the settlement liability value of these interest rate swaps to $0.4 million. These interest rate swaps were designated as hedging instruments. 
  We do not have any foreign operations and thus we are not exposed to foreign currency fluctuations.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
  (a)   Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.   We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to us, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and we necessarily were required to apply our judgment in evaluating whether the benefits of the controls and procedures that we adopt outweigh their costs. 
  As required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this   Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q   was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of   September 30, 2016  , were effective at a reasonable assurance level. 
  (b)   Changes in internal control over financial reporting.   There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
  We are not aware of any material pending legal proceedings to which we are a party or to which our properties are the subject. 
   
  Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
  There have been no material changes from the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as filed with the SEC on March 28, 2016, except as noted below. 
  Distributions paid from sources other than our cash flows from operations will result in us having fewer funds available for the acquisition of properties and other real estate-related investments, which may adversely affect our ability to fund future distributions with cash flow from operations and may adversely affect your overall return. 
  We have paid, and may continue to pay, distributions from sources other than from our cash flows from operations. For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , our cash flows provided by operations of approximately   $86.9 million   was a shortfall of   $9.1 million  , or   9.5%  , of our distributions (total distributions were approximately   $96.0 million  , of which   $44.8 million   was cash and   $51.2 million   was reinvested in shares of our common stock pursuant to the DRIP Offerings) during such period and such shortfall was paid from proceeds from our DRIP Offerings. For the year ended   December 31, 2015  , our cash flows provided by operations of approximately $107.5 million was a shortfall of $17.1 million, or 13.7%, of our distributions (total distributions were approximately $124.6 million, of which $56.8 million was cash and $67.8 million was reinvested in shares of our common stock pursuant to the DRIP Offerings) during such period and such shortfall was paid from proceeds from our DRIP Offerings. Until we acquire additional properties or other real estate-related investments, we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to pay distributions. Our inability to acquire additional properties or other real estate-related investments may result in a lower return on your investment than you expect. 
  We may pay, and have no limits on the amounts we may pay, distributions from any source, such as from borrowings, the sale of assets, the sale of additional securities, advances from our Advisor, our Advisor s deferral, and suspension and/or waiver of its fees and expense reimbursements. Funding distributions from borrowings could restrict the amount we can borrow for investments, which may affect our profitability. Funding distributions with the sale of assets may affect our ability to generate cash flows. Funding distributions from the sale of additional securities could dilute your interest in us if we sell shares of our common stock to third party investors. Our inability to acquire additional properties or real estate-related investments may have a negative effect on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations from which to pay distributions. As a result, the return investors may realize on their investment may be reduced and investors who invested in us before we generated significant cash flow may realize a lower rate of return than later investors. Payment of distributions from any of the aforementioned sources could restrict our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, affect our profitability and/or affect the distributions payable upon a liquidity event, any or all of which may have an adverse effect on an investment in us. 
   
  Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we did not sell any equity securities that were not registered or otherwise exempt under the Securities Act. 
  Use of Public Offering Proceeds 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had issued approximately   188.0 million   shares of common stock in our Offerings for gross proceeds of   $1,862.9 million  , out of which we paid   $156.5 million   in selling commissions and dealer manager fees,   $18.3 million   in other offering costs and $54.6 million in acquisition related expenses to our Advisor or its affiliates. With the net offering proceeds and associated borrowings, we had acquired   $2,189.1 million   in real estate investments, $117.2 million in real estate-related notes receivable, $17.0 million in notes receivable and   $127.1 million   in a preferred equity investment as of   September 30, 2016  . In addition, as of   September 30, 2016  , we had invested   $144.0 million   in capital improvements related to certain real estate investments.

Share Repurchase Program 
  Our share repurchase program permits stockholders to sell their shares back to us after they have held them for at least one year, subject to certain conditions and limitations. We will limit the number of shares repurchased during any calendar year to 5.0% of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding on December 31st of the previous calendar year. In addition, the share repurchase program provides that all redemptions during any calendar year, including those upon death or a qualifying disability of a stockholder, are limited to those that can be funded with equivalent reinvestments pursuant to the DRIP, which terminated on June 6, 2014, and the DRIP Offerings during the prior calendar year and other operating funds, if any, as the board of directors, in its sole discretion, may reserve for this purpose. The prices at which we repurchase our shares of common stock are based on the most recent estimated value of our shares, which currently is $10.05, and the period of time each stockholder has held their shares. Our board of directors has the right, in its sole discretion, to waive such holding requirement in the event of the death or qualifying disability of a stockholder, or other involuntary exigent circumstances, such as bankruptcy, or a mandatory requirement under a stockholder s IRA. 
  During the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we fulfilled the following repurchase requests pursuant to our share repurchase program: 

During the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we repurchased approximately $9,150,000 of common stock, which represented all repurchase requests received in good order and eligible for repurchase during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   repurchase date.
