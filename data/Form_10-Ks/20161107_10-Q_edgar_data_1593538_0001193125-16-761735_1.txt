   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS        (Information at September 30, 2016 and for the three and nine months ended        September 30, 2016 and 2015 is unaudited)        

1.   
   Significant Accounting Policies           Basis of Presentation        The accompanying unaudited, consolidated
financial statements of Navient have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the
information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Navient and its majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries and those Variable Interest Entities
( VIEs ) for which we are the primary beneficiary, after eliminating the effects of intercompany accounts and transactions. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of the results for the
interim periods have been included. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the year ending December 31, 2016 or for any other period.
These unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the  2015 Form 10-K ).
Definitions for certain capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q can be found in our 2015 Form 10-K.        Reclassifications        Certain reclassifications have been made to the
balances as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 to be consistent with classifications adopted for 2016, and had no effect on net income, total assets, or total liabilities.   
    Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements         Revenue Recognition       On May 28, 2014, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers,  which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be
entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective. In July 2015, the FASB agreed to defer the mandatory effective date by one year.
Accordingly, the new standard is effective for the Company as of January 1, 2018. Early application is permitted as of January 2017. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We are
currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures, but expect it to be immaterial.   
   Classification and Measurement       On January 5, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,  which reconsiders the classification and measurement
of financial instruments. The objective of this project is to significantly improve the usefulness of financial instrument reporting for users of financial statements. It will be effective for the Company as of January 1, 2018. We are currently
assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures, but expect it to be immaterial.

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS        (Information at September 30, 2016 and for the three and nine months ended        September 30, 2016 and 2015 is unaudited) (Continued)        

1.   
   Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)          
    Leases       On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases,  which requires the identification of arrangements that should be accounted for as leases by lessees. In general, for
lease arrangements exceeding a twelve-month term, these arrangements must be recognized as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet of the lessee. A right-of-use asset and lease obligation will be recorded for all leases, whether operating or
financing, while the income statement will reflect lease expense for operating leases and amortization/interest expense for financing leases. The balance sheet amount recorded for existing leases at the date of adoption must be calculated using the
applicable incremental borrowing rate at the date of adoption. The standard requires the use of the modified retrospective transition method, which will require adjustment to all comparative periods presented. It will be effective for the Company as
of January 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures, but expect it to be immaterial.
      Stock Compensation       On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation,  which identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of
accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they
occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for the Company as of January 1, 2017. Early application is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting
standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures, but expect it to be immaterial.   
   Allowance for Loan Losses       On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments   Credit Losses,  which requires measurement and recognition of an allowance for loan loss that
estimates remaining expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date. Our current allowance for loan loss is an incurred loss model (see  Note 2  Significant Accounting Policies  in our 2015 Form 10-K for
further discussion of our current policy). The standard is to be applied through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The standard update is
effective for the Company as of January 1, 2020, and will primarily impact the allowance for loan losses related to our Private Education Loans and FFELP Loans. Early adoption is permitted on January 1, 2019 for the Company. We are
currently evaluating the impact of adopting this update on our consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.   
    Education Loan Interest Income        The Company has a net unamortized premium balance of $451 million in connection with its $115 billion education loan portfolio as of September 30, 2016. In the third quarter of 2016, the Company
corrected its policy for applying the interest method used to amortize premium and discounts on the education loan portfolio. Previously, the Company amortized premium and discounts by including in its prepayment assumption forecasted payments
in excess of contractually required payments as well as forecasted defaults and term extensions (deferment and forbearance or other payment modification programs). We have determined that only payments in excess of contractually required
payments should be included in the prepayment assumption. Including defaults in estimated future prepayments has the effect of accelerating the amortization of the net premium balance related to our education loan portfolio. Including term
extensions in estimated future prepayments has the effect of slowing down the amortization of the net premium balance related to our education loan portfolio. We believe this correction makes us more comparable to how others apply the interest
method.

1.   
   Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)          
   The net impact of this error is currently estimated to be a $2 million reduction to our
$451 million net unamortized premium balance as of September 30, 2016. The Constant Prepayment Rates ( CPR ) as of September 30, 2016 under our revised policy are 5 percent, 3 percent and 5 percent for FFELP Stafford Loans, FFELP
Consolidation Loans and Private Education Loans, respectively. Our prior policy s CPRs as of September 30, 2016 would have been 5 percent, 3 percent and 6 percent for FFELP Stafford Loans, FFELP Consolidation Loans and Private Education Loans,
respectively.     We have concluded this error has an immaterial impact to 2016 results as well as results for prior
years. Because the estimated $2 million reduction to the net premium balance (a $1 million reduction to net income) is immaterial, the Company will record such adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2016 once the updated prepayment rates have been
finalized. We do not expect the final impact to be materially different than the $1 million reduction to net income currently estimated.       

2.   
   Allowance for Loan Losses      
  Our provisions for loan losses represent the periodic expense of maintaining an allowance sufficient to absorb incurred probable losses,
net of expected recoveries, in the held-for-investment loan portfolios. The evaluation of the provisions for loan losses is inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes. We believe that the
allowance for loan losses is appropriate to cover probable losses incurred in the loan portfolios.      We segregate our Private
Education Loan portfolio into two classes of loans   traditional and non-traditional. Non-traditional loans are loans to (i) customers attending for-profit schools with an original Fair Isaac and Company ( FICO ) score
of less than 670 and (ii) customers attending not-for-profit schools with an original FICO score of less than 640. The FICO score used in determining whether a loan is non-traditional is the greater of the customer or cosigner FICO score at
origination. Traditional loans are defined as all other Private Education Loans that are not classified as non-traditional.

(1)    
    In the second quarter of 2015, the portion of the loan amount charged off at default on Private Education Loans increased from 73 percent to 79
percent. This did not impact the provision for loan losses as previously this had been reserved through the allowance for loan losses. This change resulted in a $330 million reduction to the balance of the receivable for partially charged-off loans.

    Key Credit Quality Indicators    
  FFELP Loans are substantially insured and guaranteed as to their principal and accrued interest in the event of default; therefore, the
key credit quality indicator for this portfolio is loan status. The impact of changes in loan status is incorporated quarterly into the allowance for loan losses calculation.      For Private Education Loans, the key credit quality indicators are school type, FICO scores, the existence of a cosigner, the loan status and loan seasoning. The school type/FICO score are assessed at
origination and maintained through the traditional/non-traditional loan designation. The other Private Education Loan key quality indicators can change and are incorporated quarterly into the allowance for loan losses calculation. The following
table highlights the principal balance (excluding the receivable for partially charged-off loans) of our Private Education Loan portfolio stratified by the key credit quality indicators.   

(1)    
    Defined as loans to customers attending for-profit schools (with a FICO score of less than 670 at origination) and customers attending not-for-profit

   Receivable for Partially Charged-Off Private Education Loans    
  At the end of each month, for loans that are 212 or more days past due, we charge off the estimated loss of a defaulted loan balance.
Actual recoveries are applied against the remaining loan balance that was not charged off. We refer to this remaining loan balance as the  receivable for partially charged-off loans.  If actual periodic recoveries are less than expected,
the difference is immediately charged off through the allowance for Private Education Loan losses with an offsetting reduction in the receivable for partially charged-off Private Education Loans. If actual periodic recoveries are greater than
expected, they will be reflected as a recovery through the allowance for Private Education Loan losses once the cumulative recovery amount exceeds the cumulative amount originally expected to be recovered. The financial crisis, which began in 2007,
impacted our collections on defaulted loans and as a result, Private Education Loans which defaulted from 2007 through March 31, 2015, experienced collection performance below our pre-financial crisis experience. For that reason, until we
gained enough data and experience to determine the long-term, post-default recovery rate of 21 percent in second-quarter 2015, we established a reserve for potential shortfalls in recoveries. In the second quarter of 2015, the portion of the loan
amount charged off at default increased from 73 percent to 79 percent. This did not impact the

provision for loan losses as previously this had been reserved through the allowance for loan losses. This change resulted in a $330 million reduction to the balance of the receivable for
partially charged-off loans. We no longer expect to have significant periodic recovery shortfalls as a result of this change; however, it is possible we may continue to experience such shortfalls.   
  The following table summarizes the activity in the receivable for partially charged-off Private Education Loans.

    Current period cash collections.          

(3)    
    Prior to second-quarter 2015, charge-offs represent the current period recovery shortfall   the difference between what was expected to
be collected and what was actually collected. In the second quarter of 2015, the portion of the loan amount charged off at default increased from 73 percent to 79 percent. This change resulted in a $330 million reduction to the balance of the
receivable for partially charged-off loans. These amounts are included in total charge-offs as reported in the  Allowance for Private Education Loan Losses  table.      
   Troubled Debt Restructurings ( TDRs )       We sometimes modify the terms of loans for certain customers when we believe such modifications may increase the ability and willingness of a customer to make payments and thus increase the ultimate
overall amount collected on a loan. These modifications generally take the form of a forbearance, a temporary interest rate reduction or an extended repayment plan. For customers experiencing financial difficulty, certain Private Education Loans for
which we have granted either a forbearance of greater than three months, an interest rate reduction or an extended repayment plan are classified as TDRs. Approximately 59 percent and 56 percent of the loans granted forbearance have qualified as a
TDR loan at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The unpaid principal balance of TDR loans that were in an interest rate reduction plan as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $2.7 billion and $2.5
billion, respectively.

(1)    
    Fair values reported are exclusive of collateral held and pledged and accrued interest. Assets and liabilities are presented without consideration of
master netting agreements. Derivatives are carried on the balance sheet based on net position by counterparty under master netting agreements, and classified in other assets or other liabilities depending on whether in a net positive or negative
position.          

(2)   
       Other  includes embedded derivatives bifurcated from
securitization debt as well as derivatives related to our Total Return Swap Facility.          

(3)    
    The following table reconciles gross positions without the impact of master netting agreements to the balance sheet classification:
         
    The above fair values include adjustments for counterparty credit risk both for when we are exposed to
the counterparty, net of collateral postings, and when the counterparty is exposed to us, net of collateral postings. The net adjustments decreased the overall net asset positions at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 by

  Our corporate derivatives contain credit contingent features. At our current unsecured credit rating, we have fully collateralized our
corporate derivative liability position (including accrued interest and net of premiums receivable) of $594 million with our counterparties. Downgrades in our unsecured credit rating would not result in any additional collateral requirements, except
to increase the frequency of collateral calls. Two counterparties have the right to terminate the contracts based on our current unsecured credit rating. We are currently in an asset position with these derivative counterparties (including accrued
interest and net of premiums receivable). Trust related derivatives do not contain credit contingent features related to our or the trusts  credit ratings.

   Business Combinations   Acquisition of Gila LLC and Xtend Healthcare      
  Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting as defined in ASC 805,  Business Combinations.  The
Company allocates the purchase price to the fair value of the acquired tangible assets, liabilities and identifiable intangible assets as of the acquisition date as determined by an independent appraiser.   
    Acquisition of Gila LLC        During February 2015, the Company acquired a 98 percent majority controlling interest in Gila LLC for approximately $185 million. Gila LLC is an asset recovery and business processing firm. The firm
provides receivables management services and account processing solutions for state governments, agencies, court systems and municipalities. The results of operations of Gila LLC have been included in Navient s consolidated financial statements
since the acquisition date and are reflected in Navient s Business Services segment. Navient has not disclosed the pro forma impact of this acquisition to the results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, as the pro
forma impact was deemed immaterial.      As of September 2015, the Company finalized its purchase price allocation for Gila LLC
which resulted in an excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, or goodwill, of $97 million.   
  Identifiable intangible assets at the acquisition date included the Gila LLC trade name, an indefinite life intangible asset, with an
aggregate estimated fair value of approximately $13 million as of the acquisition date as well as definite life intangible assets with an estimated aggregate fair value of approximately $71 million as of the acquisition date. These definite life
intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships which will be amortized over 2 to 16 years depending on the economic benefit derived from each of the underlying assets.        Acquisition of Xtend Healthcare        During October 2015, Navient
acquired an 89 percent controlling interest in Xtend Healthcare for approximately $164 million. Xtend Healthcare is a healthcare revenue cycle management company that provides health insurance claims billing and account resolution, as well as

   Earnings per Common Share      
  Basic earnings per common share ( EPS ) are calculated using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding

(1)    
    Includes the potential dilutive effect of additional common shares that are issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, non-vested restricted
stock, restricted stock units, and the outstanding commitment to issue shares under applicable ESPPs, determined by the treasury stock method.          

(2)    
    For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, stock options covering approximately 4 million and 6 million shares,
respectively, were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, stock options covering approximately 5 million and
4 million shares, respectively, were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive.

   Fair Value Measurements      
  We use estimates of fair value in applying various accounting standards in our financial statements. We categorize our fair value
estimates based on a hierarchical framework associated with three levels of price transparency utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value. Please refer to  Note 12   Fair Value Measurements  in our 2015 Form
10-K for a full discussion.      During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were no significant

The significant inputs that are unobservable or from inactive markets related to our level 3 derivatives
detailed in the table above would be expected to have the following impacts to the valuations:       

Consumer Price Index/LIBOR basis swaps   These swaps do not actively trade in the markets as indicated by a wide bid/ask spread. A wider
bid/ask spread will result in a decrease in the overall valuation.          

Prime/LIBOR basis swaps   These swaps do not actively trade in the markets as indicated by a wide bid/ask spread. A wider bid/ask spread
will result in a decrease in the overall valuation. In addition, the unobservable inputs include Constant Prepayment Rates of the underlying securitization trust the swap references. A decrease in this input will result in a longer weighted average
life of the swap which will increase the value for swaps in a gain position and decrease the value for swaps in a loss position, everything else equal. The opposite is true for an increase in the input.      

Cross-currency interest rate swaps   The unobservable inputs used in these valuations are Constant Prepayment Rates of the underlying
securitization trust the swap references. A decrease in this input will result in a longer weighted average life of the swap. All else equal in a typical currency market, this will result in a decrease to the valuation due to the delay in the cash
flows of the currency exchanges as well as diminished liquidity in the forward exchange markets as you increase the term. The opposite is true for an increase in the input.

   Commitments and Contingencies           Regulatory Matters        On May 2, 2014, Navient Solutions, Inc.
( NSI ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Navient, and Sallie Mae Bank entered into consent orders with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the  FDIC ) (respectively, the  NSI Order  and the  Bank Order 
collectively, the  FDIC Orders ) to resolve matters related to certain cited violations of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, including the disclosures and assessments of certain late fees, as well as alleged violations
under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (the  SCRA ). The FDIC Orders, which became effective upon the signing of the consent order with the United States Department of Justice (the  DOJ ) by NSI and SLM BankCo on May 13,
2014, required NSI to pay $3.3 million in civil monetary penalties. NSI paid its civil monetary penalties. In addition, the FDIC Orders required the establishment of a restitution reserve account totaling $30 million to provide restitution with
respect to loans owned or originated by Sallie Mae Bank, from November 28, 2005 until the effective date of the FDIC Orders. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement among SLM Corporation, SLM BankCo and Navient dated as of
April 28, 2014 (the  Separation Agreement ), Navient funded the restitution reserve account in May 2014.

   Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)          
   The NSI Order also required NSI to ensure proper servicing for service members and
proper application of SCRA benefits under a revised and broader definition of eligibility than previously required by the statute and regulatory guidance and to make changes to billing statements and late fee practices. These changes to billing
statements and late fee practices have already been implemented. NSI also decided to voluntarily make restitution of certain late fees to all other customers whose loans were neither owned nor originated by Sallie Mae Bank. They were calculated in
the same manner as that which was required under the FDIC Orders and are estimated to be $42 million. The process to refund these fees as well as amounts from the restitution fund is complete.   
  With respect to alleged civil violations of the SCRA, NSI and Sallie Mae Bank entered into a consent order with the DOJ in May 2014. The
DOJ consent order (the  DOJ Order ) covers all loans either owned by Sallie Mae Bank or serviced by NSI from November 28, 2005 until the effective date of the settlement. The DOJ Order required NSI to fund a $60 million settlement
fund, which represents the total amount of compensation due to service members under the DOJ agreement, and to pay $55,000 in civil penalties. The DOJ Order was approved by the United States District Court in Delaware on September 29, 2014.
Shortly thereafter, Navient funded the settlement fund and paid the civil penalties pursuant to the terms of the order. On April 15, 2015, the DOJ approved the distribution plan for the settlement fund and the funds were disbursed in the second
quarter of 2015.      The total reserves established by the Company in 2013 and 2014 to cover these costs were $177 million, and
as of September 30, 2016, substantially all of this amount had been paid or credited or refunded to customer accounts. The final cost of these proceedings will remain uncertain until all of the work under the various consent orders has been
completed and the consent orders are lifted.      As previously disclosed, the Company and various of its subsidiaries are subject
to the following investigations and inquiries:       

In December 2013, Navient received Civil Investigative Demands ( CIDs ) issued by the State of Illinois Office of Attorney General and the
State of Washington Office of the Attorney General and multiple other state Attorneys General. According to the CIDs, the investigations were initiated to ascertain whether any practices declared to be unlawful under the Consumer Fraud and Deceptive
Business Practices Act have occurred or are about to occur.          

In April 2014, NSI received a CID from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the  CFPB ) as part of the CFPB s separate
investigation regarding allegations relating to Navient s disclosures and assessment of late fees and other matters. Navient has received a series of supplemental CIDs on these matters. On August 19, 2015, NSI received a letter from the
CFPB notifying NSI that, in accordance with the CFPB s discretionary Notice and Opportunity to Respond and Advise ( NORA ) process, the CFPB s Office of Enforcement is considering recommending that the CFPB take legal action
against NSI. The NORA letter relates to a previously disclosed investigation into NSI s disclosures and assessment of late fees and other matters and states that, in connection with any action, the CFPB may seek restitution, civil monetary
penalties and corrective action against NSI. The Company responded to the NORA letter on September 10, 2015.          

In November 2014, Navient s subsidiary, Pioneer Credit Recovery, Inc. ( Pioneer ), received a CID from the CFPB as part of the
CFPB s investigation regarding Pioneer s activities relating to rehabilitation loans and collection of defaulted student debt. The CFPB has informed the Company that they have combined this matter with the aforementioned servicing matter.

   Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)          

In December 2014, NSI received a subpoena from the New York Department of Financial Services (the  NY DFS ) as part of the NY DFS s
inquiry with regard to whether persons or entities have engaged in fraud or misconduct with respect to a financial product or service under New York Financial Services Law or other laws.      
  We have been in discussions with each of these regulatory entities or bodies and are cooperating with these investigations, inquiries or
examinations and are committed to resolving any potential concerns. It is not possible at this time to estimate a range of potential exposure, if any, for amounts that may be payable in connection with these matters and reserves have not been
established.      In addition, Navient and its subsidiaries are subject to examination or regulation by the SEC, CFPB, FDIC, ED
and various state agencies as part of its ordinary course of business. Items or matters similar to or different from those described above may arise during the course of those examinations. We also routinely receive inquiries or requests from
various regulatory entities or bodies or government agencies concerning our business or our assets. The Company endeavors to cooperate with each such inquiry or request.      Under the terms of the Separation Agreement, Navient has agreed to indemnify SLM BankCo for all claims, actions, damages, losses or expenses that may arise from the conduct of all activities of
pre-Spin-Off SLM BankCo occurring prior to the Spin-Off other than those specifically excluded in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. As a result, all liabilities arising out of the regulatory matters mentioned above, other than fines or
penalties directly levied against Sallie Mae Bank, are the responsibility of, or assumed by, Navient or one of its subsidiaries, and Navient has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless Sallie Mae and its subsidiaries, including Sallie Mae Bank,
therefrom. Navient has no additional reserves related to indemnification matters with SLM BankCo as of September 30, 2016.   
    OIG Audit        The Office of the Inspector General (the  OIG ) of ED commenced an audit regarding Special Allowance Payments ( SAP ) on September 10, 2007. On September 25, 2013, we
received the final audit determination of Federal Student Aid (the  Final Audit Determination ) on the final audit report issued by the OIG on August 3, 2009 related to this audit. The Final Audit Determination concurred with the
final audit report issued by the OIG and instructed us to make adjustment to our government billing to reflect the policy determination. In August 2016, we filed our notice of appeal relating to this Final Audit Determination to the Administrative
Actions and Appeals Service Group of ED. This matter remains open. We continue to believe that our SAP billing practices were proper, considering then-existing ED guidance and lack of applicable regulations. The Company established a reserve for
this matter in 2014 as part of the total reserve for pending regulatory matters discussed previously and does not believe, at this time, that an adverse ruling would have a material effect on the Company as a whole.   
    Contingencies        In the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are defendants in or parties to pending and threatened legal actions and proceedings including actions brought on behalf of various classes of
claimants. These actions and proceedings may be based on alleged violations of consumer protection, securities, employment and other laws. In certain of these actions and proceedings, claims for substantial monetary damage are asserted against us
and our subsidiaries.

   Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)          
   In the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory
examinations, information gathering requests, inquiries and investigations. In connection with formal and informal inquiries in these cases, we and our subsidiaries receive numerous requests, subpoenas and orders for documents, testimony and
information in connection with various aspects of our regulated activities.      In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting
the outcome of such litigation and regulatory matters, we cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be, what the timing or the ultimate resolution of these matters will be, or what the eventual loss, fines or penalties
related to each pending matter may be.      We are required to establish reserves for litigation and regulatory matters where
those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. When loss contingencies are not both probable and estimable, we do not establish reserves.      Based on current knowledge, reserves have been established for certain litigation or regulatory matters where the loss is both probable and estimable. Based on current knowledge, management does not
believe that loss contingencies, if any, arising from pending investigations, litigation or regulatory matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity, results of operations or cash flows.   

FFELP Loans Segment        In the FFELP Loans segment, we acquire and finance FFELP Loans. Even though FFELP Loans are no longer originated due to changes in federal law that took effect in 2010, we continue to pursue acquisitions
of FFELP Loan portfolios that leverage our servicing scale and generate incremental earnings and cash flow. In this segment, we primarily earn net interest income on the FFELP Loan portfolio (after provision for loan losses). This segment is
expected to generate significant amounts of earnings and cash flow as the portfolio amortizes.      The following table includes
GAAP basis asset information for our FFELP Loans segment.       

(1)    
    Includes restricted cash and investments.           Private Education Loans Segment        In this segment, we acquire,
finance and service Private Education Loans. Even though we no longer originate Private Education Loans, we continue to pursue acquisitions of Private Education Loan portfolios that leverage our servicing scale and generate incremental earnings and
cash flow. In this segment, we primarily earn net interest income on the Private Education Loan portfolio (after provision for loan losses). This segment is expected to generate significant amounts of earnings and cash flow as the portfolio
amortizes.

   Segment Reporting (Continued)          
   The following table includes GAAP basis asset information for our Private Education
Loans segment.       

(1)    
    Includes restricted cash and investments.           Business Services Segment        Our Business Services segment generates
revenue from servicing, asset recovery and business processing activities. Within this segment, we primarily generate revenue from servicing our FFELP Loan portfolio as well as servicing education loans for Guarantors of FFELP Loans and other
institutions, including ED. We provide asset recovery services for loans and receivables on behalf of Guarantors of FFELP Loans, higher education institutions and federal, state, court and municipal clients. In addition, we provide business
processing services on behalf of municipalities, public authorities and hospitals.      At September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the Business Services segment had total assets of $638 million and $657 million, respectively, on a GAAP basis.        Other Segment        Our Other segment primarily consists of activities of
our holding company, including the repurchase of debt, our corporate liquidity portfolio, unallocated overhead and regulatory-related costs. We also include results from certain smaller wind-down operations within this segment. Overhead expenses
include costs related to executive management, the board of directors, accounting, finance, legal, human resources, stock-based compensation expense and certain information technology costs related to infrastructure and operations.
Regulatory-related costs include actual settlement amounts as well as third-party professional fees we incur in connection with regulatory matters.      At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Other segment had total assets of $2.6 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, on a GAAP basis.   
    Measure of Profitability        We prepare financial statements in accordance with GAAP. However, we also evaluate our business segments on a basis that differs from GAAP. We refer to this different basis of presentation as  Core
Earnings.  We provide this  Core Earnings  basis of presentation on a consolidated basis for each business segment because this is what we review internally when making management decisions regarding our performance and how we
allocate resources. We also refer to this information in our presentations with credit rating agencies, lenders and investors. Because our  Core Earnings  basis of presentation corresponds to our segment financial presentations, we are
required by GAAP to provide  Core Earnings  disclosure in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for our business segments.

11.   
   Segment Reporting (Continued)          
    Core Earnings  are not a substitute for reported results under GAAP. We use
 Core Earnings  to manage each business segment because  Core Earnings  reflect adjustments to GAAP financial results for three items, discussed below, that are either related to the Spin-Off or create significant volatility
mostly due to timing factors generally beyond the control of management. Accordingly, we believe that  Core Earnings  provide management with a useful basis from which to better evaluate results from ongoing operations against the business
plan or against results from prior periods. Consequently, we disclose this information because we believe it provides investors with additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely assessed by
management. When compared to GAAP results, the three items we remove to result in our  Core Earnings  presentations are:       

1.  
  The financial results attributable to the operations of SLM BankCo prior to the Spin-Off and related restructuring and other reorganization expense incurred in
connection with the Spin-Off, including the restructuring expenses related to the restructuring initiative launched in second-quarter 2015 to simplify and streamline the Company s management structure post-Spin-Off. For GAAP purposes, Navient
reflected the deemed distribution of SLM BankCo on April 30, 2014. For  Core Earnings,  we exclude the consumer banking business (SLM BankCo) as if it had never been a part of Navient s historical results prior to the deemed
distribution of SLM BankCo on April 30, 2014;         

2.  
  Unrealized mark-to-market gains/losses resulting from our use of derivative instruments to hedge our economic risks that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment
or do qualify for hedge accounting treatment but result in ineffectiveness; and         

3.  
  The accounting for goodwill and acquired intangible assets.        While GAAP provides a uniform, comprehensive basis of accounting, for the reasons described above, our  Core Earnings  basis of presentation does not.  Core Earnings  are subject to
certain general and specific limitations that investors should carefully consider. For example, there is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for management reporting. Our  Core Earnings  are not defined terms within GAAP and may not
be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Accordingly, our  Core Earnings  presentation does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Investors, therefore, may not be able to compare our performance
with that of other financial services companies based upon  Core Earnings.   Core Earnings  results are only meant to supplement GAAP results by providing additional information regarding the operational and performance
indicators that are most closely used by management, our board of directors, credit rating agencies, lenders and investors to assess performance.

(1)   
       SLM BankCo s operations and restructuring and other reorganization
expense in connection with the Spin-Off:  For  Core Earnings,  we have assumed the consumer banking business (SLM BankCo) was never a part of Navient s historical results prior to the deemed distribution of SLM BankCo on
April 30, 2014 and we have removed the restructuring and other reorganization expense incurred in connection with the Spin-Off, including the restructuring expenses related to the restructuring initiative launched in second-quarter 2015 to
simplify and streamline the Company s management structure post-Spin-Off. Excluding these items provides management with a useful basis from which to better evaluate results from ongoing operations against results from prior periods. The
adjustment relates to the exclusion of the consumer banking business and represents the operations, assets, liabilities and equity of SLM BankCo, which is comprised of Sallie Mae Bank, Upromise Rewards, the Insurance Business, and the Private
Education Loan origination functions. Included in these amounts are also certain general corporate overhead expenses related to the consumer banking business. General corporate overhead consists of costs primarily associated with accounting,
finance, legal, human resources, certain information technology costs, stock compensation, and executive management and the board of directors. These costs were generally allocated to the consumer banking business based on the proportionate level of
effort provided to the consumer banking business relative to SLM Corporation using a relevant allocation driver (e.g., in proportion to the number of employees by function that were being transferred to SLM BankCo as opposed to remaining at
Navient). All intercompany transactions between SLM BankCo and Navient have been eliminated. In addition, all preferred stock dividends have been removed as SLM BankCo succeeded SLM Corporation as the issuer of the preferred stock in connection with
the Spin-Off. The restructuring and other reorganization expense incurred in connection with the Spin-Off includes the restructuring expenses related to the restructuring initiative launched in second-quarter 2015 to simplify and streamline the
Company s management structure post-Spin-Off.          

(2)   
       Derivative accounting:   Core Earnings  exclude periodic
unrealized gains and losses that are caused by the mark-to-market valuations on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under GAAP as well as the periodic unrealized gains and losses that are a result of ineffectiveness
recognized related to effective hedges under GAAP. These unrealized gains and losses occur in our FFELP Loans, Private Education Loans and Other business segments. Under GAAP, for our derivatives that are held to maturity, the cumulative net
unrealized gain or loss over the life of the contract will equal $0 except for Floor Income Contracts where the cumulative unrealized gain will equal the amount for which we sold the contract. In our  Core Earnings  presentation, we
recognize the economic effect of these hedges, which generally results in any net settlement cash paid or received being recognized ratably as an interest expense or revenue over the hedged item s life.      

(3)   
       Goodwill and acquired intangible assets:  Our  Core
Earnings  exclude goodwill and intangible asset impairment and amortization of acquired intangible assets.          

(4)   
       Net tax effect:  Such tax effect is based upon our  Core
Earnings  effective tax rate for the year.

   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations      
  This report contains  forward-looking  statements and other information that is based on management s current expectations
as of the date of this report. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about our beliefs, opinions, or expectations and statements that assume or are dependent upon future events, are forward-looking statements and often
contain words such as  expect,   anticipate,   intend,   plan,   believe,   seek,   see,   will,   would,  or  target.  Forward-looking statements
are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from those reflected in such forward-looking statements.   
  For us, these factors include, among others, the risks and uncertainties associated with:   

increases in financing costs;          

the availability of financing;

changes in the terms of education loans and the educational credit marketplace (including changes resulting from new laws and the implementation of
existing laws).         We could also be affected by, among other things:   

unanticipated deferrals in our FFELP securitization trusts that would delay repayment of the bonds beyond their legal final maturity date;

reductions to our credit ratings, the credit ratings of asset-backed securitizations we sponsor or the credit ratings of the United States of America;

failures of our operating systems or infrastructure, or those of third-party vendors;      

risks related to cybersecurity including the potential disruption of our systems or potential disclosure of confidential customer information;

failures to successfully implement cost-cutting initiatives and adverse effects of such initiatives on our business;      

delays or errors in converting portfolio acquisitions to our servicing platform;      

risks associated with restructuring initiatives;          

changes in law and regulations with respect to the student lending business and financial institutions generally;

changes in the general interest rate environment, including the relationship between the relevant money-market index rate and the rate at which our
assets are priced;          

our ability to successfully effectuate any acquisitions and other strategic initiatives;

the other factors that are described in the  Risk Factors  section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015 (the  2015 Form 10-K ) and in our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).         The preparation of our consolidated financial statements also requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions including estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates or
assumptions may prove to be incorrect and actual results could differ materially. All forward-looking statements contained in this report are qualified by these cautionary statements and are made only as of the date of this document. We do not
undertake any obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements except as required by law.      Definitions for
certain capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Quarterly Report on  Form 10-Q  can be found in the  Glossary  section of our 2015 Form 10-K.   
  Through this discussion and analysis, we intend to provide the reader with some narrative context for how our management views our
consolidated financial statements, additional context within which to assess our operating results, and information on the quality and variability of our earnings, liquidity and cash flows.       Navient s Business       Navient is the nation s leading loan
management, servicing and asset recovery company, committed to helping customers navigate the path to financial success. Servicing more than $300 billion in education loans, Navient supports the educational and economic achievements of more than
12 million customers. A growing number of public and private sector clients rely on Navient for proven solutions to meet their financial goals. Navient began trading on NASDAQ as an independent company on May 1, 2014. Our website is
navient.com. Information contained or referenced on our website is not incorporated by reference into and does not form a part of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.      Navient holds the largest portfolio of education loans insured or guaranteed under the Federal Family Education Loan Program ( FFELP ), as well as the largest portfolio of Private Education
Loans. FFELP Loans are insured or guaranteed by state or not-for-profit agencies based on guaranty agreements among the United States Department of Education ( ED ) and these agencies. Private Education Loans are education loans to
students or their families that bear the full credit risk of the customer and any cosigner. Private Education Loans are made primarily to bridge the gap between the cost of higher education and the amount funded through financial aid, federal loans
or students  and families  resources.      Navient services its own portfolio of education loans, as well as education
loans owned by banks, credit unions, other financial institutions, non-profit education lenders and ED. Navient is one of four Title IV Additional Servicers ( TIVAS ) to ED under its Direct Student Loan Program ( DSLP ). Navient
also provides asset recovery services on its own portfolio (consisting of both education loans and other asset classes), and on behalf of guaranty agencies, higher education institutions, and federal, state, court and municipal clients. In addition,
we provide business processing services on behalf of municipalities, public authorities and hospitals.      As of
September 30, 2016, Navient s principal assets consisted of:       

$90.1 billion in FFELP Loans, with a net interest margin of 0.87 percent for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 on a  Core Earnings 
basis and a weighted average life of 7.1 years;      
         45   

Table of Contents  

$24.0 billion in Private Education Loans, with a net interest margin of 3.48 percent for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 on a  Core
Earnings  basis and a weighted average life of 6.5 years;          

a leading education loan servicing platform that services loans for more than 12 million DSLP Loan, FFELP Loan and Private Education Loan
customers (including cosigners), including 6.2 million customer accounts serviced under Navient s contract with ED; and          

a leading asset recovery and business processing platform where we currently provide services for over 1,000 public and private sector clients.
         Strengths and Opportunities       Navient possesses a number of competitive advantages that distinguish it from its competitors, including:        Large, high quality asset base generating significant and predictable cash flows.   At September 30, 2016, Navient s $114.2 billion education loan portfolio is 76 percent funded to
term and is expected to produce consistent and predictable cash flows over the remaining life of the portfolio. Navient s $90.1 billion portfolio of FFELP Loans bears a maximum 3 percent loss exposure due to the federal guaranty. Navient s
$24.0 billion portfolio of Private Education Loans bears the full credit risk of the borrower and any cosigner. Navient expects that cash flows from its FFELP Loan and Private Education Loan portfolios will significantly exceed future debt service
obligations.        Efficient and large scale operating platforms.   Navient is the largest servicer of education loans,
servicing over $300 billion in education loans for more than 12 million customers. Navient s inventory of contingent asset recovery receivables is $19.9 billion as of September 30, 2016 and provides services to over 1,000 public and
private sector clients. Navient has demonstrated scalable infrastructure with capacity to add volume at a low cost. Navient s market share and tested infrastructure make it well-positioned to expand its businesses to additional clients and
asset types.        Superior performance.   Navient has demonstrated superior default prevention performance and
industry-leading asset recovery services. The combined portfolio of federal loans serviced by Navient experienced a Cohort Default Rate ( CDR ) of 8 percent, which is 31 percent lower than peers, as calculated from the most recent CDR
released by ED in September 2016. We are consistently a top performer in our asset recovery business and deliver superior service to our public and private sector clients.        Commitment to compliance and customer centricity.   Navient fosters a robust compliance culture driven by a  customer first  approach. We invest in rigorous training programs,
internal and external auditing, escalated service tracking and analysis, and customer research to enhance our compliance and customer service.        Strong capital return.   As a result of our significant cash flow and capital generation, Navient expects to return excess capital to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. In
December 2014, Navient s board of directors authorized $1 billion to be utilized in a new common share repurchase program effective January 1, 2015, and in December 2015, our board authorized an additional $700 million for common share
repurchases. Navient increased its quarterly dividend amount from $0.15 per share to $0.16 per share effective for its first-quarter 2015 dividends. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we paid $154 million in dividends on shares of
our common stock and repurchased 47.1 million shares of our common stock for $575 million. As of September 30, 2016, the remaining common share repurchase authority was $180 million.   
    Meaningful growth opportunities.   Navient will pursue opportunistic acquisitions of FFELP and Private Education Loan
portfolios. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Navient acquired $2.8 billion of education loans. Navient will also pursue additional third-party servicing, asset recovery and business processing contracts. In February 2015,
Navient completed the acquisition of Gila LLC (commonly known as Municipal Services Bureau, or MSB), an asset recovery and business processing firm. The firm provides receivables management services and account processing solutions for state
governments, agencies, court systems and   
         46

municipalities. In October 2015, Navient completed the acquisition of Xtend Healthcare, a health care revenue cycle management company. The firm provides health insurance claims billing and
account resolution, as well as patient billing and customer service. The acquisition leverages Navient s asset recovery and business processing capabilities into the health care payments sector. Navient intends to leverage its large-scale
operating platforms, superior default prevention and asset recovery performance, operating efficiency and regulatory compliance and risk management infrastructure in growing these business lines and in pursuing other growth opportunities.
       Navient s Approach to Helping Education Loan Borrowers Achieve Success     
  Navient services loans for more than 12 million DSLP Loan, FFELP Loan and Private Education Loan customers, including
6.2 million customers whose accounts are serviced under Navient s contract with ED. We help our customers navigate the path to financial success through proactive outreach and emphasis on identifying the payment plan that best fits their
individual budgets and financial goals.      In our experience, customer success means making steady progress toward repayment,
instead of falling behind on or putting off payments. This experience has taught us that the transition from school to full repayment requires customer contact and counseling. For many customers, education loans are their first borrowing experience.
For new graduates, salaries grow over time, typically making payments easier to handle as their career progresses. It is also not uncommon for some borrowers to seek payment deferments if they return to school or encounter temporary interruptions in
earnings.      To help customers manage these realities, Navient makes customer success and default prevention top priorities. We
customize our outreach using data-driven approaches that draw from our more than 40 years of experience in helping customers successfully manage their loans. As a result, our customers experience higher rates of repayment success as evidenced by
lower delinquencies and defaults.      We have been a partner in ED s campaign to inform federal education loan customers
about various income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans, and have played a leadership role in helping customers understand their options so they can make an informed choice. We promote awareness of federal repayment plan options through more
than 170 million communications annually, including mail, email, phone calls, videos, and text messages. As of September 30, 2016, more than one in five federal borrowers and more than 40 percent of dollar volume serviced by Navient
(excluding Parent PLUS loans that are not eligible for IDR) were enrolled in an IDR plan.      We also find that customers who
have fallen behind benefit from our outreach and assistance. In fact, nine times out of 10 when we can reach federal loan customers who have missed payments, we can identify a solution to help them avoid default.   
  For those who need it, Navient launched its highly successful private loan modification program in 2009. As of September 30, 2016,
$2.7 billion of our Private Education Loans were enrolled in the interest rate reduction component of our modification program, helping customers have a more affordable monthly payment while making progress in repaying the principal loan balance.
     Our Private Education Loan charge-off rate fell to 1.9 percent for the third-quarter 2016 and we saw lower delinquency,
forbearance and default rates for the federal loans we service compared with third-quarter 2015. As of September 30, 2016, Navient s total delinquency rate for FFELP and charge-off rate for Private Education Loans were at their lowest
levels since 2006.     We continually make enhancements designed to help our customers, drawing from a variety of inputs including
customer surveys, analysis of customer inquiries and complaint data, regulator commentary, and website activity. We regularly use customer and employee research panels to gather real-time feedback to inform enhancements underway.

   Our Office of the Customer Advocate, established in 1997, offers escalated assistance to
customers who need it. We are committed to working with customers and appreciate customer comments, which, combined with our own customer communication channels, help us improve the ways we assist our customers.   
  Navient takes seriously its commitment to serve military customers and has developed what it believes is a best-in-class approach to
assist them. Navient was the first student loan servicer to launch a dedicated military benefits customer service team, and was also the first student loan servicer to launch a dedicated military benefits website, Navient.com/military, and a
toll-free number dedicated to military customers. Navient s military benefits team offers a single point of contact for all calls from service members and their families to help them access the benefits designed for them, including interest
rate benefits, deferment and other options.      We also continue to offer free resources to help customers and the general public
build knowledge on personal finance topics, and we make recommendations for reforms to enhance student loan repayment success. We offer  Path to Success,  a series of financial literacy videos. We also conduct a national research study,
 Money Under 35,  which measures the financial health of Americans ages 22 to 35.

    Selected Historical Financial Information and Ratios    

(1)   
       Core Earnings  are non-GAAP financial measures and do not
represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. For a greater explanation of  Core Earnings,  see the section titled   Core Earnings    Definition and Limitations  and subsequent sections.
         Overview       The following discussion and analysis presents a review of our business and operations as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.   
  We monitor and assess our ongoing operations and results based on the following four reportable segments: (1) FFELP Loans
(2) Private Education Loans, (3) Business Services and (4) Other.        FFELP Loans Segment
       In the FFELP Loans segment, we acquire and finance FFELP Loans. Even though FFELP Loans are no longer originated due
to changes in federal law that took effect in 2010, we continue to pursue acquisitions of   
         49   

Table of Contents  

FFELP Loan portfolios that leverage our servicing scale to generate incremental earnings and cash flow. In this segment, we primarily earn net interest income on the FFELP Loan portfolio (after
provision for loan losses). This segment is expected to generate significant amounts of earnings and cash flow as the portfolio amortizes.        Private Education Loans Segment        In this segment, we acquire,
finance and service our Private Education Loans. Even though we no longer originate Private Education Loans, we continue to pursue acquisitions of Private Education Loan portfolios that leverage our servicing scale to generate incremental earnings
and cash flow. In this segment, we primarily earn net interest income on the Private Education Loan portfolio (after provision for loan losses). This segment is expected to generate significant amounts of earnings and cash flow as the portfolio
amortizes.        Business Services Segment        Our Business Services segment generates revenue from servicing, asset recovery and business processing activities. Within this segment, we primarily generate revenue from servicing our FFELP Loan
portfolio as well as servicing education loans for Guarantors of FFELP Loans and other institutions, including ED. We provide asset recovery services for loans and receivables on behalf of Guarantors of FFELP Loans, higher education institutions and
federal, state, court and municipal clients. In addition, we provide business processing services on behalf of municipalities, public authorities and hospitals.        Other        Our Other segment primarily consists of activities of our
holding company, including the repurchase of debt, our corporate liquidity portfolio, unallocated overhead and regulatory-related costs. We also include results from certain smaller wind-down operations within this segment.   
   Key Financial Measures    
  Our operating results are primarily driven by net interest income, provisions for loan losses and expenses incurred in our education loan
portfolios; the revenues and expenses generated by our servicing, asset recovery and business processing businesses; and gains and losses on loan sales and debt repurchases. We manage and assess the performance of each business segment separately as
each is focused on different customers and each derives its revenue from different activities and services. A brief summary of our key financial measures (net interest income; provisions for loan losses; charge-offs and delinquencies; servicing,
asset recovery and business processing revenues; other income (loss); and operating expenses) can be found in Item 7.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our 2015 Form 10-K.
      Third-Quarter 2016 Summary of Results       We report financial results on a GAAP basis and also present certain  Core Earnings  performance measures. Our management, equity investors, credit rating agencies and debt capital providers use
these  Core Earnings  measures to monitor our business performance. See   Core Earnings    Definition and Limitations  for a further discussion and a complete reconciliation between GAAP net income and
 Core Earnings.       Third-quarter 2016 GAAP net income was $230 million ($0.73 diluted earnings per share), versus net
income of $237 million ($0.63 diluted earnings per share) in the third-quarter 2015. The changes in GAAP net income are impacted by the same items in  Core Earnings  that are discussed below, as well as changes in net income attributable
to (1) restructuring and reorganization expense incurred in connection with the Spin-Off of Navient from SLM Corporation on April 30, 2014, including the restructuring expenses related to the restructuring initiative launched in
second-quarter 2015 to simplify and streamline the Company s management structure post-Spin-Off, (2) unrealized, mark-to-market gains/losses on derivatives and (3) goodwill and acquired intangible asset amortization and impairment.
These items are recognized in GAAP but have not been included in

Core Earnings  results. Third-quarter 2016 GAAP results included gains of $139 million from derivative accounting treatment that are excluded from  Core Earnings  results,
compared with gains of $108 million in the year-ago period. See   Core Earnings    Definition and Limitations   Differences between  Core Earnings  and GAAP  for a complete reconciliation
between GAAP net income and  Core Earnings.        Core Earnings  for the quarter were $157 million ($0.50
diluted earnings per share), compared with $174 million ($0.47 diluted earnings per share) for the year-ago quarter. The increase in diluted  Core Earnings  per share was primarily the result of a $17 million reduction in the provision for
loan losses, a $12 million increase in asset recovery and business processing revenue, and common share repurchases, partially offset by a $55 million reduction in net interest income. Third-quarter 2016 and 2015 diluted  Core Earnings 
per share were $0.51 and $0.48, respectively, excluding regulatory-related costs of $6 million and $8 million, respectively.   
  During the first nine months of 2016, we:       

acquired $2.8 billion of education loans;          

issued $3.9 billion of FFELP asset-backed securities ( ABS ) and $488 million of Private Education Loan ABS;      

closed on a $478 million Private Education Loan ABS Repurchase Facility;      

increased our FFELP asset-backed commercial paper ( ABCP ) facility from $7.0 billion to $7.5 billion and extended its maturity date from
March 2017 to March 2018;          

extended our Private Education Loan ABCP facility from June 2016 to June 2017; the maximum financing amount decreased to $750 million from $1 billion;

issued $1.3 billion in unsecured debt;          

retired or repurchased $1.8 billion of our senior unsecured debt;      

repurchased 47.1 million common shares for $575 million on the open market; and      

paid $154 million in common dividends.          Results of Operations       We present the results of operations below first on
a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP. Following our discussion of consolidated earnings results on a GAAP basis, we present our results on a segment basis. We have four business segments: FFELP Loans, Private Education Loans, Business
Services and Other. Since these segments operate in distinct business environments and we manage and evaluate the financial performance of these segments using non-GAAP financial measures, these segments are presented on a  Core Earnings 
basis (see   Core Earnings    Definition and Limitations ).

    Consolidated Earnings Summary   GAAP basis    
   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, net income was $230 million, or $0.73 diluted earnings per common share, compared with
net income of $237 million, or $0.63 diluted earnings per common share, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in diluted earnings per share was primarily due to a $117 million increase in net gains (losses) on derivative
and hedging activities, a $17 million decrease in the provision for loan losses, a $12 million increase in asset recovery and business processing revenue, and common share repurchases. This was partially offset by a $141 million decrease in net
interest income.      The primary contributors to each of the identified drivers of changes in net income for the current quarter
compared with the year-ago quarter are as follows:       

Net interest income decreased by $141 million, as a result of the amortization of the education loan balance and a decline in the net interest margin.

Provisions for loan losses decreased $17 million from the year-ago quarter as a result of the overall improvement in Private Education Loans 
credit quality, delinquency and charge-off trends, all of which led to decreases in expected future charge-offs.         

Asset recovery and business processing revenue increased $12 million. This increase was primarily due to additional revenue from Gila LLC (acquired in
February 2015) and from Xtend Healthcare (acquired in October 2015), which was offset by a reduction in revenue related to a decrease in education loan-related asset recovery volume.     

Net gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities increased $117 million. The primary factors affecting the change were interest rate and foreign
currency fluctuations, which primarily affected the valuations of our Floor Income Contracts, basis swaps and foreign currency hedges during each period. Valuations of derivative instruments fluctuate based upon many factors including changes in
interest rates, credit risk, foreign currency fluctuations and other market factors. As a result, net gains and losses on derivative and hedging activities may continue to vary significantly in future periods.      

Third-quarter 2016 and 2015 expenses included regulatory-related costs of $6 million and $8 million, respectively. Excluding these regulatory-related
costs, third-quarter 2016 operating expenses were $222 million, a $2 million increase from the year-ago quarter. This increase was due to an increase in operating costs related to Gila LLC (acquired in February 2015) and to Xtend Healthcare
(acquired in October 2015). Excluding these acquisitions, operating expenses decreased 7 percent primarily as a result of a general reduction in costs related to the implementation of various efficiency initiatives.      
  We repurchased 14.3 million shares and 12.1 million shares of our common stock during the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively, as part of our common share repurchase program. Primarily as a result of ongoing common share repurchases, our average outstanding diluted shares decreased by 59 million common shares from the year-ago quarter.
      Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net income was $535 million, or $1.63 diluted earnings per common share, compared with
net income of $711 million, or $1.83 diluted earnings per common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in diluted earnings per share was primarily due to a $358 million decrease in net interest income, a $51 million
decrease in other income, a $28 million decrease in servicing revenue, a $23 million increase in operating expenses and a $12 million decrease in gains on sales of loans. This was partially offset by a $119 million decrease in the provision for loan
losses, a $38 million increase in net gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, a $32 million decrease in restructuring and other reorganization expenses, and a $15 million increase in asset recovery and business processing revenue.

   The primary contributors to each of the identified drivers of changes in net income for the
current nine-month period compared with the year-ago nine-month period are as follows:       

Net interest income decreased by $358 million, as a result of the amortization of the education loan balance and a decline in the net interest margin.

Provisions for loan losses decreased $119 million from the year-ago period as a result of the overall improvement in Private Education Loans 
credit quality, delinquency and charge-off trends, all of which led to decreases in expected future charge-offs. The provision for loan losses was elevated in the year-ago period due to an increase in the amount of loans exiting deferment status in
2014 over prior years and those loans experiencing unfavorable credit trends compared to loans that exited deferment in prior years.          

Servicing revenue decreased by $28 million primarily due to a benefit recorded in the year-ago period as a result of increasing our recovery
expectation on previously assessed servicing fees.          

Asset recovery and business processing revenue increased $15 million. This increase was primarily due to additional revenue from Gila LLC (acquired in
February 2015) and from Xtend Healthcare (acquired in October 2015), which was offset by a reduction in revenue related to a legislative reduction in certain education loan-related fees earned as well as a decrease in education loan-related asset
recovery volume.          

Other income decreased $51 million primarily due to a reduction in foreign currency translation gains. The foreign currency translation gains relate to
a portion of our foreign currency denominated debt that does not receive hedge accounting treatment. These gains were partially offset by the  gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net  line item on the income statement
related to the derivatives used to economically hedge these debt instruments.          

Gains on sales of loans and investments decreased $12 million as a result of $12 million in gains on the sale of $383 million of FFELP Loans in the
year-ago period. There were no sales in the current period.          

Net gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities increased $38 million. The primary factors affecting the change were interest rate and foreign
currency fluctuations, which primarily affected the valuations of our Floor Income Contracts, basis swaps and foreign currency hedges during each period. Valuations of derivative instruments fluctuate based upon many factors including changes in
interest rates, credit risk, foreign currency fluctuations and other market factors. As a result, net gains and losses on derivative and hedging activities may continue to vary significantly in future periods.      

In the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, we recorded regulatory-related costs of $14 million and $12 million, respectively. Excluding these
regulatory-related costs, operating expenses were $692 million, a $21 million increase from the year-ago period. This increase was due to an increase in operating costs related to Gila LLC (acquired in February 2015) and to Xtend Healthcare
(acquired in October 2015). Excluding these acquisitions, operating expenses decreased 7 percent primarily as a result of a general reduction in costs related to the implementation of various efficiency initiatives.      

Goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairment and amortization expense increased $15 million primarily as a result of the intangible assets and
related amortization from our acquisitions of Gila LLC and Xtend Healthcare.          

Restructuring and other reorganization expenses decreased $32 million, from $32 million to $0 million. During the year-ago quarter, the Company
launched a restructuring initiative to simplify and streamline its management structure post-Spin-Off to improve the operating efficiency and effectiveness of the organization, and as a result recorded $29 million of restructuring expense primarily
related to expected severance and other related costs.         We repurchased 47.1 million shares and
41.9 million shares of our common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as part of our common share repurchase program. Primarily as a result of ongoing common share repurchases, our average
outstanding diluted shares decreased by 60 million common shares from the year-ago period.

     Core Earnings    Definition and Limitations    
  We prepare financial statements and present financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, we also evaluate our business segments and
present financial results on a basis that differs from GAAP. We refer to this different basis of presentation as  Core Earnings.  We provide this  Core Earnings  basis of presentation on a consolidated basis for each business
segment because this is what we review internally when making management decisions regarding our performance and how we allocate resources. We also refer to this information in our presentations with credit rating agencies, lenders and investors.
Because our  Core Earnings  basis of presentation corresponds to our segment financial presentations, we are required by GAAP to provide  Core Earnings  disclosure in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for our
business segments.       Core Earnings  are not a substitute for reported results under GAAP. We use  Core
Earnings  to manage each business segment because  Core Earnings  reflect adjustments to GAAP financial results for three items, discussed below, that are either related to the Spin-Off or create significant volatility mostly due to
timing factors generally beyond the control of management. Accordingly, we believe that  Core Earnings  provide management with a useful basis from which to better evaluate results from ongoing operations against the business plan or
against results from prior periods. Consequently, we disclose this information because we believe it provides investors with additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely assessed by management.
When compared to GAAP results, the three items we remove to result in our  Core Earnings  presentations are:       

1.  
  The financial results attributable to the operations of SLM BankCo prior to the Spin-Off and related restructuring and reorganization expense incurred in connection
with the Spin-Off, including the restructuring expenses related to the restructuring initiative launched in second-quarter 2015 to simplify and streamline the Company s management structure post-Spin-Off. For GAAP purposes, Navient reflected
the deemed distribution of SLM BankCo on April 30, 2014. For  Core Earnings,  we exclude the consumer banking business (SLM BankCo) as if it had never been a part of Navient s historical results prior to the deemed distribution
of SLM BankCo on April 30, 2014;         

2.  
  Unrealized mark-to-market gains/losses resulting from our use of derivative instruments to hedge our economic risks that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment
or do qualify for hedge accounting treatment but result in ineffectiveness; and         

3.  
  The accounting for goodwill and acquired intangible assets.        While GAAP provides a uniform, comprehensive basis of accounting, for the reasons described above, our  Core Earnings  basis of presentation does not.  Core Earnings  are subject to
certain general and specific limitations that investors should carefully consider. For example, there is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for management reporting. Our  Core Earnings  are not defined terms within GAAP and may not
be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Accordingly, our  Core Earnings  presentation does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Investors, therefore, may not be able to compare our performance
with that of other financial services companies based upon  Core Earnings.   Core Earnings  results are only meant to supplement GAAP results by providing additional information regarding the operational and performance
indicators that are most closely used by management, our board of directors, credit rating agencies, lenders and investors to assess performance.

     Differences between  Core Earnings  and GAAP     
  The following discussion summarizes the differences between  Core Earnings  and GAAP net income and details each specific
adjustment required to reconcile our  Core Earnings  segment presentation to our GAAP earnings.       
    1)  SLM BankCo s operations and restructuring and other reorganization expense in connection with
the Spin-Off:  On April 30, 2014, the Spin-Off of Navient from SLM Corporation was completed and Navient became an independent, publicly-traded company. Due to the relative significance of Navient to SLM Corporation prior to the Spin-Off,
among other factors, for financial reporting purposes Navient is treated as the  accounting spinnor  and therefore is the  accounting successor  to SLM Corporation as constituted prior to the Spin-Off, notwithstanding the legal
form of the Spin-Off. Since Navient is treated for accounting purposes as the  accounting spinnor,  the GAAP financial statements of Navient reflect the deemed distribution of SLM BankCo to SLM BankCo s stockholders on April 30,
2014.      For  Core Earnings,  we have assumed SLM BankCo was never a part of Navient s historical results prior
to the deemed distribution of SLM BankCo on April 30, 2014 and we have removed the restructuring and other reorganization expense incurred in connection with the Spin-Off, including the restructuring expenses related to the restructuring
initiative launched in second-quarter 2015 to simplify and streamline the Company s management structure post-Spin-Off. Excluding these items provides management with a useful basis from which to better evaluate results from ongoing operations
against results from prior periods. The adjustment relates to the exclusion of the consumer banking business and represents the operations, assets, liabilities and equity of SLM BankCo, which is comprised of Sallie Mae Bank, Upromise Rewards, the
Insurance Business, and the Private Education Loan origination functions. Included in these amounts are also certain general corporate overhead expenses related to the consumer banking business. General corporate overhead consists of costs primarily
associated with accounting, finance, legal, human resources, certain information technology costs, stock compensation, and executive management and the board of directors. These costs were generally allocated to the consumer banking business based
on the proportionate level of effort provided to the consumer banking business relative to SLM Corporation using a relevant allocation driver (e.g., in proportion to the number of employees by function that were being transferred to SLM BankCo as
opposed to remaining at Navient). All intercompany transactions between SLM BankCo and Navient have been eliminated. In addition, all prior preferred stock dividends have been removed as SLM BankCo succeeded SLM Corporation as the issuer of the
preferred stock in connection with the Spin-Off.

   2)  Derivative Accounting:     Core Earnings  exclude periodic
unrealized gains and losses that are caused by the fair value adjustments on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under GAAP, as well as the periodic unrealized gains and losses that are a result of ineffectiveness
recognized related to effective hedges under GAAP. These unrealized gains and losses occur in our FFELP Loans, Private Education Loans and Other business segments. Under GAAP, for our derivatives that are held to maturity, the cumulative net
unrealized gain or loss over the life of the contract will equal $0 except for Floor Income Contracts, where the cumulative unrealized gain will equal the amount for which we sold the contract. In our  Core Earnings  presentation, we
recognize the economic effect of these hedges, which generally results in any net settlement cash paid or received being recognized ratably as an interest expense or revenue over the hedged item s life.   
  The accounting for derivatives requires that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in earnings,
with no fair value adjustment of the hedged item, unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. We believe that our derivatives are effective economic hedges, and as such, are a critical element of our interest rate and foreign currency risk
management strategy. However, some of our derivatives, primarily Floor Income Contracts and certain basis swaps, do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and the stand-alone derivative must be adjusted to fair value in the income statement with
no consideration for the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged item. These gains and losses recorded in  Gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net  are primarily caused by interest rate and foreign currency
exchange rate volatility and changing credit spreads during the period as well as the volume and term of derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment.      Our Floor Income Contracts are written options that must meet more stringent requirements than other hedging relationships to achieve hedge effectiveness. Specifically, our Floor Income Contracts do not
qualify for hedge accounting treatment because the pay down of principal of the education loans underlying the Floor Income embedded in those education loans does not exactly match the change in the notional amount of our written Floor Income
Contracts. Additionally, the term, the interest rate index, and the interest rate index reset frequency of the Floor Income Contract can be different than that of the education loans. Under derivative accounting treatment, the upfront contractual
payment is deemed a liability and changes in fair value are recorded through income throughout the life of the contract. The change in the fair value of Floor Income Contracts is primarily caused by changing interest rates that cause the amount of
Floor Income paid to the counterparties to vary. This is economically offset by the change in the amount of Floor Income earned on the underlying education loans but that offsetting change in fair value is not recognized. We believe the Floor Income
Contracts are economic hedges because they effectively fix the amount of Floor Income earned over the contract period, thus eliminating the timing and uncertainty that changes in interest rates can have on Floor Income for that period. Therefore,
for purposes of  Core Earnings,  we have removed the unrealized gains and losses related to these contracts and added back the amortization of the net contractual premiums received on the Floor Income Contracts. The amortization of the net
contractual premiums received on the Floor Income Contracts for  Core Earnings  is reflected in education loan interest income. Under GAAP accounting, the premiums received on the Floor Income Contracts are recorded as revenue in the
 gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net  line item by the end of the contracts  lives.      Basis
swaps are used to convert floating rate debt from one floating interest rate index to another to better match the interest rate characteristics of the assets financed by that debt. We primarily use basis swaps to hedge our education loan assets that
are primarily indexed to LIBOR or Prime. The accounting for derivatives requires that when using basis swaps, the change in the cash flows of the hedge effectively offset both the change in the cash flows of the asset and the change in the cash
flows of the liability. Our basis swaps hedge variable interest rate risk; however, they generally do not meet this effectiveness test because the index of the swap does not exactly match the index of the hedged assets as required for hedge
accounting treatment. Additionally, some of our FFELP Loans can earn at either a variable or a fixed interest rate depending on market interest rates and therefore swaps economically hedging these FFELP Loans do not meet the criteria for hedge
accounting treatment. As a result, under GAAP, these swaps are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected currently in the income statement.

    Reclassification of Realized Gains (Losses) on Derivative and Hedging Activities
      Derivative accounting requires net settlement income/expense on derivatives and realized gains/losses related to
derivative dispositions (collectively referred to as  realized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities ) that do not qualify as hedges to be recorded in a separate income statement line item below net interest income. Under our
 Core Earnings  presentation, these gains and losses are reclassified to the income statement line item of the economically hedged item. For our  Core Earnings  net interest margin, this would primarily include:
(a) reclassifying the net settlement amounts related to our Floor Income Contracts to education loan interest income and (b) reclassifying the net settlement amounts related to certain of our basis swaps to debt interest expense. The table
below summarizes the realized losses on derivative and hedging activities and the associated reclassification on a  Core Earnings  basis.       
     Cumulative Impact of Derivative Accounting under GAAP compared to  Core Earnings 
      As of September 30, 2016, derivative accounting has reduced GAAP equity by approximately $255 million as a result of
cumulative net unrealized losses (after tax) recognized under GAAP, but not in  Core Earnings.  The following table rolls forward the cumulative impact to GAAP equity due to these unrealized after tax net losses related to derivative
accounting.       

(1)    
    Net impact of net unrealized gains (losses) under derivative accounting is composed of the following:

    Hedging FFELP Loan Embedded Floor Income    
  Net Floor premiums received on Floor Income Contracts that have not been amortized into  Core Earnings  as of the respective
year-ends are presented in the table below. These net premiums will be recognized in  Core Earnings  in future periods. As of September 30, 2016, the remaining amortization term of the net floor premiums was approximately 5.2 years.
Historically, we have sold Floor Income Contracts on a periodic basis and depending upon market conditions and pricing, we may enter into additional Floor Income Contracts in the future. The balance of unamortized Floor Income Contracts will
increase as we sell new contracts and decline due to the amortization of existing contracts.      In addition to using Floor
Income Contracts, we also use pay fixed interest rate swaps to hedge the embedded Floor Income within FFELP Loans. These interest rate swaps qualify as GAAP hedges and are accounted for as cash flow hedges of variable rate debt. For GAAP, gains and
losses on the effective portion of these hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and gains and losses on the ineffective portion are recorded immediately to earnings. Hedged Floor Income from these cash flow hedges that has not
been recognized into  Core Earnings  and GAAP as of the respective period-ends is presented in the table below. This hedged Floor Income will be recognized in  Core Earnings  and GAAP in future periods and is presented net of
tax. As of September 30, 2016, the remaining hedged period is approximately 5.2 years. Historically, we have used pay fixed interest rate swaps on a periodic basis to hedge embedded Floor Income and depending upon market conditions and pricing,
we may enter into swaps in the future. The balance of unrecognized hedged Floor Income will increase as we enter into new swaps and decline as revenue is recognized.       

3)  Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets:  Our  Core Earnings  exclude goodwill and intangible asset impairment
and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. The following table summarizes the goodwill and acquired intangible asset adjustments.

securitization trusts or a similar rate if a loan is not in a term financing facility (which is presented as an intercompany charge from the Business Services segment who services the loans), the fees we pay for third-party loan servicing and costs
incurred to acquire loans. The intercompany revenue charged by the Business Services segment and included in those amounts was $96 million and $106 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $296
million and $324 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These amounts exceed the actual cost of servicing the loans. Operating expenses were 43 basis points and 44 basis points of average FFELP
Loans in the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 43 basis points and 44 basis points of average FFELP Loans in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in operating expenses
from the year-ago periods was primarily the result of the decrease in the balance of the portfolio and the average servicing rate paid.

  The following table includes  Core Earnings  results for our Private Education Loans segment.   
   
     Core Earnings for the segment were $60 million in third-quarter 2016, compared with the year-ago
quarter s $77 million. This decrease was primarily the result of a $51 million decrease in net interest income due to the amortization of the portfolio and a decrease in net interest margin, partially offset by a $25 million decrease in the
provision for loan losses.  Core Earnings  key performance metrics are as follows:

    In the second quarter of 2015, the portion of the loan amount charged off at default increased from 73 percent to 79 percent. This did not impact the
provision for loan losses as previously this had been reserved through the allowance for loan losses. This change resulted in a $330 million reduction to the balance of the receivable for partially charged-off loans.

        The Company acquired $66 million of Private Education Loans in third-quarter 2016. As of September 30,
2016, our Private Education Loan portfolio totaled $24.0 billion. The weighted-average life of this portfolio as of September 30, 2016 was 6.5 years assuming a CPR of 5 percent.   
    Private Education Loan Provision for Loan Losses        In establishing the allowance for Private Education Loan losses as of September 30, 2016, we considered several factors with respect to our Private Education Loan portfolio. Total loans delinquent
(as a percentage of loans in repayment) decreased to 6.9 percent from 7.4 percent in the year-ago quarter. Loans greater than 90 days delinquent (as a percentage of loans in repayment) decreased to 3.2 percent from 3.4 percent in the year-ago
quarter. The charge-off rate decreased to 1.9 percent from 2.3 percent in the year-ago quarter. Loans in forbearance (as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance) was 4.0 percent, unchanged from the year-ago quarter.   
  The Private Education Loan provision for loan losses was $92 million in the third quarter of 2016, down $25 million from the third
quarter of 2015 as a result of the overall improvement in credit quality, delinquency and charge-off trends, all of which led to decreases in expected future charge-offs.       Operating Expenses   Private Education Loans Segment     
  Operating expenses for our Private Education Loans segment include costs incurred to service and collect on our Private Education Loan
portfolio. Operating expenses were $40 million and $39 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $124 million and $127 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

    Business Services Segment       The following table includes  Core Earnings  results for our Business Services segment.       
     Core Earnings  were $81 million in third-quarter 2016, compared with $79 million in the
year-ago quarter. Key segment metrics are as follows:       
    Revenues related to services performed on FFELP Loans accounted for 66 percent and 71 percent,
respectively, of total Business Services segment revenues for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and 65 percent and 72 percent, respectively, of total Business Services segment revenues for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015.       Servicing Revenue       Our Business Services segment includes intercompany loan servicing fees from servicing the FFELP Loans in our FFELP Loans segment. The average balance of this portfolio was $91 billion and $98 billion for
the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $93 billion and $99 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decline in the intercompany loan servicing revenue from the year-ago
periods was the primary reason for the decline in servicing revenue and was due to the decrease in the average servicing rate paid as well as the decline in the average balance of FFELP Loans serviced.

   The Company services education loans for more than 12 million DSLP Loan, FFELP Loan and
Private Education Loan customers (including cosigners), including 6.2 million customer accounts under the ED Servicing Contract as of September 30, 2016, compared with 6.3 million customer accounts serviced at September 30, 2015.
Third-party loan servicing fees in the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 included $38 million and $35 million, respectively, of servicing revenue related to the ED Servicing Contract. On June 13, 2014, ED extended its servicing
contract with us to service Direct Student Loan Program federal loans for five more years.      On April 4, 2016, ED published the
first part of a two-part request for proposals ( RFP ) related to a new servicing platform for the Direct Student Loan Program. The first part of the RFP focused on screening candidates  capabilities relative to certain published
criteria. In July 2016, Navient was selected as one of three companies eligible to submit responses in the second part of the RFP process. On October 26, 2016, ED published the second part of the RFP. We are currently in the process of reviewing the
RFP to determine the scope of services to be delivered and the economics of the proposed contract.       Asset Recovery and
Business Processing Revenue       Our asset recovery and business processing revenue consists of fees we receive for asset
recovery of delinquent and defaulted debt on behalf of third-party clients performed on a contingent basis. Business processing revenue consists of fees we earn processing transactions on behalf of our municipal, public authority and hospital
clients. Asset recovery and business processing revenue increased $12 million from the year-ago quarter. This increase was primarily due to additional revenue from Gila LLC (acquired in February 2015) and from Xtend Healthcare (acquired in October
2015), which was offset by a reduction in revenue related to a decrease in education loan-related asset recovery volume, mostly related to the ED contract discussed below.      Since 1997, Navient has provided asset recovery services on defaulted education loans to ED. This contract expired by its terms on February 21, 2015 and our Pioneer Credit Recovery
( Pioneer ) subsidiary received no new account placements under the contract. We engaged with ED to learn more about their decision and address any questions or concerns they may have. In addition, on March 9, 2015, Pioneer filed a
bid protest with the U.S. Government Accountability Office ( GAO ). This bid protest was dismissed on March 13, 2015 from the GAO based upon overlapping jurisdiction. Following the bid protest dismissal, Pioneer filed its own
complaint with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, which complaint was consolidated with several similar cases filed by other private collection agencies. On April 16, 2015, Pioneer s complaint, together with the other plaintiffs 
consolidated complaints, was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. We appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and, on July 16, 2016, the Court of Appeals reversed the ruling of the Federal Court of
Claims and remanded the case for further proceedings.      Separately, we have submitted a response to ED s RFP in relation
to a new contract for similar services. There can be no assurances that Pioneer will be awarded an extension of the existing contract, or a new contract awarded to Pioneer or any other Navient subsidiary.   
    Operating Expenses   Business Services Segment     
  Operating expenses for our Business Services segment primarily include costs incurred to service our FFELP Loan portfolio, third-party
servicing and asset recovery and business processing costs, and other operating costs. The $1 million increase in operating expenses in the third quarter of 2016 compared with the year-ago quarter was due to operating costs related to Gila LLC,
which was acquired in February 2015, and to Xtend Healthcare, acquired in October 2015. This increase was partially offset by a general reduction in costs primarily related to the implementation of various efficiency initiatives.

    Ending total loans represents gross Private Education Loans, plus the receivable for partially charged-off loans.      
  As part of determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, we review key allowance and loan metrics. The most significant of
these metrics considered are the charge-off rate and delinquency and forbearance percentages and the resulting allowance coverage of charge-offs ratio, and the allowance as a percentage of total loans and of loans in repayment.   
   Receivable for Partially Charged-Off Private Education Loans    
  At the end of each month, for loans that are 212 or more days past due, we charge off the estimated loss of a defaulted loan balance.
Actual recoveries are applied against the remaining loan balance that was not charged off. We refer to this remaining loan balance as the  receivable for partially charged-off loans.  If actual periodic recoveries are less than expected,
the difference is immediately charged off through the allowance for Private Education Loan losses with an offsetting reduction in the receivable for partially charged-off Private Education Loans. If actual periodic recoveries are greater than
expected, they will be reflected as a recovery through the allowance for Private Education Loan losses once the cumulative recovery amount exceeds the cumulative amount originally expected to be recovered. The financial crisis, which began in 2007,
impacted our collections on defaulted loans and as a result, Private Education Loans which defaulted from 2007 through March 31, 2015, experienced collection performance below our pre-financial crisis experience. For that reason, until we
gained   
         80

enough data and experience to determine the long-term, post-default recovery rate of 21 percent in second-quarter 2015, we established a reserve for potential shortfalls in recoveries. In the
second quarter of 2015, the portion of the loan amount charged off at default increased from 73 percent to 79 percent. This did not impact the provision for loan losses as previously this had been reserved through the allowance for loan losses. This
change resulted in a $330 million reduction to the balance of the receivable for partially charged-off loans. We no longer expect to have significant periodic recovery shortfalls as a result of this change; however, it is possible we may continue to
experience such shortfalls.      The following table summarizes the activity in the receivable for partially charged-off Private
Education Loans.

    Prior to second-quarter 2015, charge-offs represent the current period recovery shortfall   the difference between what was expected to
be collected and what was actually collected. In the second quarter of 2015, the portion of the loan amount charged off at default increased from 73 percent to 79 percent. This change resulted in a $330 million reduction to the balance of the
receivable for partially charged-off loans. These amounts are included in total charge-offs as reported in the  Allowance for Private Education Loan Losses  table.      
   Use of Forbearance as a Private Education Loan Collection Tool    
  Forbearance involves granting the customer a temporary cessation of payments (or temporary acceptance of smaller than scheduled payments)
for a specified period of time. Using forbearance extends the original term of the loan. Forbearance does not grant any reduction in the total repayment obligation (principal or interest). While in forbearance status, interest continues to accrue
and is capitalized to principal when the loan re-enters repayment status. Our forbearance policies include limits on the number of forbearance months granted consecutively and the total number of forbearance months granted over the life of the loan.
In some instances, we require good-faith payments before granting forbearance. Exceptions to forbearance policies are permitted when such exceptions are judged to increase the likelihood of recovery of the loan. Forbearance as a recovery tool is
used most effectively when applied based on a customer s unique situation, including historical information and judgments. We leverage updated customer information and other decision support tools to best determine who will be granted
forbearance based on our expectations as to a customer s ability and willingness to repay their obligation. This strategy is aimed at mitigating the overall risk of the portfolio as well as encouraging cash resolution of delinquent loans.
     Forbearance may be granted to customers who are exiting their grace period to provide additional time to obtain employment
and income to support their obligations, or to current customers who are faced with a hardship and request forbearance time to provide temporary payment relief. In these circumstances, a customer s loan is placed into a forbearance status in
limited monthly increments and is reflected in the forbearance status at month-end during this time. At the end of their granted forbearance period, the customer will enter repayment status as current and is expected to begin making their scheduled
monthly payments on a go-forward basis.   
         81   

Table of Contents  

   Forbearance may also be granted to customers who are delinquent in their payments. In these
circumstances, the forbearance cures the delinquency and the customer is returned to a current repayment status. In more limited instances, delinquent customers will also be granted additional forbearance time.   
  The tables below show the composition and status of the Private Education Loan portfolio aged by the number of months for which a
scheduled monthly payment was received. As indicated in the tables, the percentage of loans that are in forbearance status, are delinquent greater than 90 days or that are charged off decreases the longer the loans have been making scheduled monthly
payments.      At September 30, 2016, loans in forbearance status as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance were
14.9 percent for loans that have made less than 25 monthly payments. The percentage drops to 1.9 percent for loans that have made more than 48 monthly payments. Approximately 44 percent of our Private Education Loans in forbearance status have made
less than 25 monthly payments.      At September 30, 2016, loans in repayment that are delinquent greater than 90 days as a
percentage of loans in repayment were 10.2 percent for loans that have made less than 25 monthly payments. The percentage drops to 1.7 percent for loans that have made more than 48 monthly payments. Approximately 33 percent of our Private Education
Loans in repayment that are delinquent greater than 90 days have made less than 25 monthly payments.      For the three months
ended September 30, 2016, charge-offs as a percentage of loans in repayment were 7 percent for loans that have made less than 25 monthly payments. The percentage drops to 1 percent for loans that have made more than 48 monthly payments.
Approximately 42 percent of our Private Education Loan charge-offs occurring in third-quarter 2016 made less than 25 monthly payments.

    Private Education Loan Repayment Options    
  Certain loan programs allow customers to select from a variety of repayment options depending on their loan type and their enrollment/loan
status, which include the ability to extend their repayment term or change their monthly payment. The chart below provides the optional repayment offerings in addition to the standard level principal and interest payments as of September 30,
2016.       

(1)   
       Deferred  includes loans for which no payments are required and
interest charges are capitalized into the loan balance.         The graduated repayment program that is part of
Signature and Other Loans includes an interest-only payment feature that may be selected at the option of the customer. Customers elect to participate in this program at the time they enter repayment following their grace period. This program is
available to customers in repayment, after their grace period, who would like a temporary lower payment from the required principal and interest payment amount. Customers participating in this program pay monthly interest with no amortization of
their principal balance for up to 48 payments after entering repayment (dependent on the loan product type). The maturity date of the loan is not extended when a customer participates in this program. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015,
customers in repayment owing approximately $1.0 billion (4 percent of loans in repayment) and $2.3 billion (9 percent of loans in repayment), respectively, were enrolled in the interest-only program.   
   Liquidity and Capital Resources         Funding and Liquidity Risk Management        The following  Liquidity
and Capital Resources  discussion concentrates on our FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans segments. Our Business Services and Other segments require minimal capital and funding.   
  We define liquidity as cash and high-quality liquid assets that we can use to meet our cash requirements. Our two primary liquidity needs
are: (1) servicing our debt and (2) our ongoing ability to meet our cash needs for running the operations of our businesses (including derivative collateral requirements) throughout market cycles, including during periods of financial
stress. Secondary liquidity needs, which can be adjusted as needed, include acquisitions of Private Education Loan and FFELP Loan portfolios, acquisitions of companies, the payment of common stock dividends and the repurchase of common stock under
common share repurchase programs. To achieve these objectives, we analyze and monitor our liquidity needs, maintain excess liquidity and access diverse funding sources including the issuance of unsecured debt and the issuance of secured debt
primarily through asset-backed securitizations and/or other financing facilities.      We define liquidity risk as the potential
inability to meet our obligations when they become due without incurring unacceptable losses or invest in future asset growth and business operations at reasonable market rates. Our primary liquidity risk relates to our ability to service our debt,
meet our other business obligations and to continue to grow our business. The ability to access the capital markets is impacted by general market and economic conditions, our credit ratings, as well as the overall availability of funding sources in
the marketplace. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including over-the-counter derivatives.   
         84   

Table of Contents  

   Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions subject to ongoing review by the ratings agencies
and may change, from time to time, based on our financial performance, industry and market dynamics and other factors. Other factors that influence our credit ratings include the ratings agencies  assessment of the general operating
environment, our relative positions in the markets in which we compete, reputation, liquidity position, the level and volatility of earnings, corporate governance and risk management policies, capital position and capital management practices. A
negative change in our credit rating could have a negative effect on our liquidity because it might raise the cost and availability of funding and potentially require additional cash collateral or restrict cash currently held as collateral on
existing borrowings or derivative collateral arrangements. It is our objective to improve our credit ratings so that we can continue to efficiently access the capital markets even in difficult economic and market conditions.   
  We have unsecured debt that totaled $14.5 billion at September 30, 2016. Three credit rating agencies currently rate our long-term
unsecured debt at below investment grade. From May 1, 2014 (Spin-Off) to September 30, 2016, we issued $2.8 billion of unsecured debt ($1.0 billion in fourth-quarter 2014, $500 million in first-quarter 2015 and $1.3 billion in
third-quarter 2016) at an average all-in cost of one-month LIBOR plus 4.79 percent and an average term to maturity of 6.8 years. Recent market conditions and other factors have adversely impacted the cost and availability of new unsecured debt
financing.      As of June 30, 2016, Moody s and Fitch had on credit watch $56.2 billion and $50.5 billion, respectively, of
non-recourse FFELP ABS sponsored by our affiliates due to concerns that trust cash flows may not be sufficient to pay all bonds by the legal final maturity date. The credit watch actions created dislocation in the FFELP ABS market, which has
impacted the cost and availability of FFELP ABS financing.      Since June 30, 2016, Moody s and Fitch have taken final
ratings action on $40.8 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively, of non-recourse FFELP ABS sponsored by our affiliates due to concerns that trust cash flows may not be sufficient to pay all bonds by the legal final maturity date. These actions have
resulted in downgrades to non-investment grade rating on $4.1 billion and $0.8 billion in FFELP ABS by Moody s and Fitch, respectively. Subsequent to the initial downgrade action, Fitch has upgraded $0.5 billion of FFELP ABS to investment
grade after the Company successfully extended the legal final maturity dates of these bonds. As of November 4, 2016, $12.9 billion and $39.5 billion, respectively, of non-recourse FFELP ABS sponsored by our affiliates remain on credit watch by
Moody s and Fitch.      Navient issued $3.9 billion of FFELP ABS from March 2016 to September 2016 (in five different
transactions). As of November 4, 2016, Navient has been successful in extending the legal final maturity dates for $7.3 billion of FFELP ABS bonds in various Navient-sponsored FFELP securitizations.   
  We expect to fund our ongoing liquidity needs, including the repayment of $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes that mature in the next
twelve months, primarily through our current cash, investments and unencumbered FFELP Loan portfolio, the predictable operating cash flows provided by operating activities ($1.1 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2016), the repayment of
principal on unencumbered education loan assets, and the distribution of overcollateralization from our securitization trusts. We may also, depending on market conditions and availability, draw down on our secured FFELP Loan and Private Education
Loan facilities, issue term ABS, enter into additional Private Education Loan ABS repurchase facilities, or issue additional unsecured debt.      We no longer originate Private Education Loans or FFELP Loans and therefore no longer have liquidity requirements for new originations, but we may purchase Private Education Loan and FFELP Loan portfolios
from third parties.

    Liquidity may also be available under secured credit facilities to the extent we have eligible collateral
and capacity available. Maximum borrowing capacity under the FFELP Loan   other facilities will vary and be subject to each agreement s borrowing conditions, including, among others, facility size, current usage and availability
of qualifying collateral from unencumbered FFELP Loans. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the maximum additional capacity under these facilities was $3.6 billion and $10.1 billion, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, the average maximum additional capacity under these facilities was $3.4 billion and $11.0 billion, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the average maximum additional capacity under these facilities was
$2.3 billion and $12.0 billion, respectively. The $6.5 billion reduction in the maximum additional capacity between September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2016 primarily related to a $7.1 billion reduction in the availability under the
facility with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines ( FHLB ). As previously disclosed, we received notice from FHLB that availability under the facility would be reduced and will mature in the first quarter of 2021. Both of these
actions were taken by the FHLB in relation to the publication in January 2016 of new rules by the Federal Home Finance Agency, the primary regulator of the FHLB, governing eligibility of, and borrowing capacity for, certain insurance companies who
are existing members of the Federal Home Loan Bank system. As of September 30, 2016, the maximum capacity and the amount outstanding under this facility was $3.5 billion and we do not expect to borrow more than this amount in the future.   
  In addition to the FFELP Loan   other facilities, liquidity may also be available from our Private Education Loan ABCP
facility. On June 27, 2016, this facility was renewed and extended from its original maturity date of June 30, 2016 to June 26, 2017. This facility s maximum financing amount, which was originally $1 billion, is now $750
million. At September 30, 2016, the available capacity under this facility was $405 million. Borrowing under this facility will vary and is subject to the availability of qualifying collateral from unencumbered Private Education Loans.
     At September 30, 2016, we had a total of $8.4 billion of unencumbered tangible assets inclusive of those listed in the table
above as sources of primary liquidity. Total unencumbered education loans comprised $3.9 billion of our unencumbered tangible assets of which $3.0 billion and $0.9 billion related to Private Education Loans and FFELP Loans, respectively. In
addition, as of September 30, 2016, we had $10.7 billion of encumbered net assets (i.e., overcollateralization) in our various financing facilities (consolidated variable interest entities). In fourth-quarter 2015, we closed on a $550 million

Facility and on April 15, 2016, we closed on a second $478 million Private Education Loan ABS Repurchase Facility. Both repurchase facilities are collateralized by Residual Interests in
previously issued Private Education Loan ABS trusts. These are examples of how we can effectively finance previously encumbered assets to generate additional liquidity in addition to the unencumbered assets we traditionally have encumbered in the
past. Additionally, these repurchase facilities have a cost of funds lower than that of a new unsecured debt issuance.      For
further discussion of our various sources of liquidity, our access to the ABS market, our asset-backed financing facilities, and our issuance of unsecured debt, see  Note 6   Borrowings  in our 2015 Form 10-K.

     Financing Transactions during the Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016       During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Navient issued $3.9 billion in
FFELP Loan ABS, $488 million in Private Education Loan ABS and $1.3 billion in unsecured debt.      In the first-quarter 2016,
Navient increased and extended its FFELP Loan ABCP facility. The facility s maturity date was extended to March 2018 from March 2017 and its maximum financing amount, which was originally scheduled to step down to $7 billion in March 2016, was
increased to $7.5 billion with a step down to $6.75 billion in March 2017. This facility provides liquidity for refinancing and acquisitions of FFELP Loans.      In the second-quarter 2016, Navient extended and reduced the capacity of its Private Education Loan ABCP facility. The maturity date on our Private Education Loan ABCP facility was extended from June 2016
to June 2017 and the maximum financing amount available under the facility was reduced from $1 billion to $750 million. This facility provides liquidity for Private Education Loans.   
  In the second-quarter 2016, we completed a $478 million Private Education Loan ABS repurchase transaction collateralized by Residual
Interests in three previously issued Private Education Loan ABS trusts.       Shareholder Distributions    
  In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we paid three quarterly common stock dividends of $0.16 per share.   
  We repurchased 47.1 million shares of common stock for $575 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The shares
were repurchased under our previously disclosed share repurchase program. As   
         87   

Table of Contents  

of September 30, 2016, the remaining repurchase authority was $180 million. In the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we repurchased 41.9 million shares for $775 million. Since the
Spin-Off, we repurchased 125.2 million shares.       Recent Fourth-Quarter 2016 Transactions    
  In October 2016, we issued $1.9 billion in FFELP Loan ABS.        Counterparty Exposure        Counterparty exposure related to financial
instruments arises from the risk that a lending, investment or derivative counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations to us. Risks associated with our lending portfolio are discussed in the section titled  Financial
Condition   FFELP Loan Portfolio Performance  and    Private Education Loan Portfolio Performance.       Our investment portfolio is composed of very short-term securities issued by a diversified group of highly rated issuers, limiting our counterparty exposure. Additionally, our investing activity is
governed by board of director approved limits on the amount that is allowed to be invested with any one issuer based on the credit rating of the issuer, further minimizing our counterparty exposure. Counterparty credit risk is considered when
valuing investments and considering impairment.      Related to derivative transactions, protection against counterparty risk is
generally provided by International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. ( ISDA ) Credit Support Annexes ( CSAs ). CSAs require a counterparty to post collateral if a potential default would expose the other party to a loss.
All corporate derivative contracts entered into by Navient are covered under such agreements and require collateral to be exchanged based on the net fair value of derivatives with each counterparty. Our securitization trusts require collateral in
all cases if the counterparty s credit rating is withdrawn or downgraded below a certain level. Additionally, securitizations involving foreign currency notes issued after November 2005 also require the counterparty to post collateral to the
trust based on the fair value of the derivative, regardless of credit rating. The trusts are not required to post collateral to the counterparties. In all cases, our exposure is limited to the value of the derivative contracts in a gain position net
of any collateral we are holding. We consider counterparties  credit risk when determining the fair value of derivative positions on our exposure net of collateral.      We have liquidity exposure related to collateral movements between us and our derivative counterparties. Movements in the value of the derivatives, which are primarily affected by changes in interest rate
and foreign exchange rates, may require us to return cash collateral held or may require us to access primary liquidity to post collateral to counterparties. See  Note 7   Derivative Financial Instruments  in our 2015 Form
10-K for more information on the amount of cash that has been received and delivered to derivative counterparties.      The table

      Core Earnings  Basis Borrowings     
  The following tables present the ending balances of our  Core Earnings  basis borrowings as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, and average balances and average interest rates of our  Core Earnings  basis borrowings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The average interest rates include derivatives that are
economically hedging the underlying debt but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. (See   Core Earnings    Definition and Limitations   Differences between  Core Earnings  and

       Other  primarily includes the obligation to return cash

  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations addresses our consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. A discussion of our critical accounting policies, which include allowance for loan losses, premium and discount amortization related to our loan portfolio, fair value measurement,
transfers of financial assets and the VIE consolidation model and derivative accounting can be found in our 2015 Form 10-K. There were no significant changes to these critical accounting policies during the first nine months of 2016. See discussion
below for a correction in our policy related to applying the interest method used to amortize premiums and discounts on the education loan portfolios.      The Company has a net unamortized premium balance of $451 million in connection with its $115 billion education loan portfolio as of September 30, 2016. In the third quarter of 2016, the Company
corrected its policy for applying the interest method used to amortize premium and discounts on the education loan portfolio. Previously, the Company amortized premium and discounts by including in its prepayment assumption forecasted payments in
excess of contractually required payments as well as forecasted defaults and term extensions (deferment and forbearance or other payment modification programs). We have determined that only payments in excess of contractually required payments
should be included in the prepayment assumption. Including defaults in estimated future prepayments has the effect of accelerating the amortization of the net premium balance related to our education loan portfolio. Including term extensions in
estimated future prepayments has the effect of slowing down the amortization of the net premium balance related to our education loan portfolio. We believe this correction makes us more comparable to how others apply the interest method.
     The net impact of this error is currently estimated to be a $2 million reduction to our $451 million net unamortized premium
balance as of September 30, 2016. The Constant Prepayment Rates ( CPR ) as of September 30, 2016 under our revised policy are 5 percent, 3 percent and 5 percent for FFELP Stafford Loans, FFELP Consolidation Loans and Private
Education Loans, respectively. Our prior policy s CPRs as of September 30, 2016 would have been 5 percent, 3 percent and 6 percent for FFELP Stafford Loans, FFELP Consolidation Loans and Private Education Loans, respectively.  
         90   

Table of Contents  

   We have concluded this error has an immaterial impact to 2016 results as well as results for
prior years. Because the estimated $2 million reduction to the net premium balance (a $1 million reduction to net income) is immaterial, the Company will record such adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2016 once the updated prepayment rates
have been finalized. We do not expect the final impact to be materially different than the $1 million reduction to net income currently estimated.       

Item 3.   
   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk          Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis       Our interest rate risk management seeks
to limit the impact of short-term movements in interest rates on our results of operations and financial position. The following tables summarize the potential effect on earnings over the next 12 months and the potential effect on fair values of
balance sheet assets and liabilities at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, based upon a sensitivity analysis performed by management assuming a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points and 300 basis points
while funding spreads remain constant. Additionally, as it relates to the effect on earnings, a sensitivity analysis was performed assuming the funding index increases 25 basis points while holding the asset index constant, if the funding index and
repricing frequency are different than the asset index. The earnings sensitivity is applied only to financial assets and liabilities, including hedging instruments that existed at the balance sheet date and does not take into account new assets,
liabilities or hedging instruments that may arise over the next 12 months.       

(1)    
    If an asset is not funded with the same index/frequency reset of the asset then it is assumed the funding index increases 25 basis points while
holding the asset index constant.          

(2)    
    Calculated based on  increase (decrease) in net income before taxes.       
         91   

Table of Contents  

A primary objective in our funding is to minimize our sensitivity to changing interest rates by generally
funding our floating rate education loan portfolio with floating rate debt. However, due to the ability of some FFELP loans to earn Floor Income, we can have a fixed versus floating mismatch in funding if the education loan earns at the fixed
borrower rate and the funding remains floating. In addition, we can have a mismatch in the index (including the frequency of reset) of floating rate debt versus floating rate assets.   
  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, certain FFELP Loans were earning Floor Income and we locked in a
portion of that Floor Income through the use of Floor Income Contracts. The result of these hedging transactions was to convert a portion of the fixed rate nature of education loans to variable rate, and to fix the relative spread between the
education loan asset rate and the variable rate liability.      In the preceding tables, under the scenario where interest rates
increase 100 and 300 basis points, the change in pre-tax net income before the unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities is primarily due to the impact of (i) our unhedged loans being in a fixed-rate mode due to Floor
Income, while being funded with   
         92   

Table of Contents  

variable rate debt in low interest rate environments; and (ii) a portion of our variable rate assets being funded with fixed rate liabilities and equity. Item (i) will generally cause
income to decrease when interest rates increase from a low interest rate environment, whereas item (ii) will generally cause income to increase when interest rates increase. In both 2015 and 2016 the loss of income is due almost entirely
to item (i) above. Item (ii) had very little impact in either period as the Company entered into derivative contracts in 2015 to convert a portion of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt as a part of its overall interest rate risk management
strategy, thereby better match-funding its floating rate assets with variable rate debt.      In the preceding tables, under the
scenario where interest rates increase 100 and 300 basis points, the change in unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities in 2015 and 2016 are primarily due to (1) the notional amount and remaining term of our derivative
portfolio and related hedged debt and (2) the interest rate environment. As of September 30, 2016 the Company s derivative portfolio has declined in size and has a shorter remaining term than the prior year period due to the natural
amortization of the education loan portfolios over the year. Both of these factors contribute to the Company losing less income in an increasing interest rate environment in the current period as compared to the prior year period.   
  Under the scenario in the tables above labeled  Impact on Annual Earnings If: Funding Indices Increase 25 Basis Points,  the
main driver of the decrease in pre-tax income before unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities in both the September 30, 2016 and 2015 analyses is primarily the result of one-month LIBOR-indexed FFELP Loans being funded
with three-month LIBOR and other non-discrete indexed liabilities. See  Asset and Liability Funding Gap  of this Item 3 for a further discussion. Increasing the spread between indices will also impact the unrealized gains (losses) on
derivative and hedging activities as it relates to basis swaps that hedge the mismatch between the asset and funding indices.   
  In addition to interest rate risk addressed in the preceding tables, we are also exposed to risks related to foreign currency exchange
rates. Foreign currency exchange risk is primarily the result of foreign currency denominated debt issued by us. When we issue foreign denominated corporate unsecured and securitization debt, our policy is to use cross currency interest rate swaps
to swap all foreign currency denominated debt payments (fixed and floating) to U.S. dollar LIBOR using a fixed exchange rate. In the tables above, there would be an immaterial impact on earnings if exchange rates were to decrease or increase, due to
the terms of the hedging instrument and hedged items matching. The balance sheet interest bearing liabilities would be affected by a change in exchange rates; however, the change would be materially offset by the cross currency interest rate swaps
in other assets or other liabilities. In the current economic environment, volatility in the spread between spot and forward foreign exchange rates has resulted in material mark-to-market impacts to current-period earnings which have not been
factored into the above analysis. The earnings impact is noncash, and at maturity of the instruments the cumulative mark-to-market impact will be zero.

    Asset and Liability Funding Gap    
  The tables below present our assets and liabilities (funding) arranged by underlying indices as of September 30, 2016. In the
following GAAP presentation, the funding gap only includes derivatives that qualify as effective hedges (those derivatives which are reflected in net interest margin, as opposed to those reflected in the  gains (losses) on derivatives and
hedging activities, net  line on the consolidated statements of income). The difference between the asset and the funding is the funding gap for the specified index. This represents our exposure to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk
and repricing risk, which is the risk that the different indices may reset at different frequencies or may not move in the same direction or at the same magnitude.      Management analyzes interest rate risk and in doing so includes all derivatives that are economically hedging our debt whether they qualify as effective hedges or not ( Core Earnings  basis).
Accordingly, we are also presenting the asset and liability funding gap on a  Core Earnings  basis in the table that follows the GAAP presentation.       GAAP Basis:        

(1)    
    FFELP Loans of $32.5 billion ($28.9 billion LIBOR index and $3.6 billion Treasury bill index) are currently earning a fixed rate of interest as a
result of the low interest rate environment.          

(2)    
    Funding (by index) includes all derivatives that qualify as hedges.      

(3)    
    Funding consists of auction rate ABS and ABCP facilities.      

(4)    
    Assets include restricted and unrestricted cash equivalents and other overnight type instruments. Funding includes the obligation to return cash
collateral held related to derivatives exposures.          

(5)    
    Assets include receivables and other assets (including goodwill and acquired intangibles). Funding includes other liabilities and stockholders 
equity.         The  Funding Gaps  in the above table are primarily interest rate mismatches in
short-term indices between our assets and liabilities. We address this issue typically through the use of basis swaps that typically convert quarterly reset three-month LIBOR to other indices that are more correlated to our asset indices. These
basis swaps do not qualify as effective hedges and, as a result, the effect on the funding index is not included in our interest margin and is therefore excluded from the GAAP presentation.   
         94

     Core Earnings  Basis:    

(1)    
    FFELP Loans of $14.9 billion ($13.2 billion LIBOR index and $1.7 billion Treasury bill index) are currently earning a fixed rate of interest as a
result of the low interest rate environment.          

(2)    
    Funding (by index) includes all derivatives that management considers economic hedges of interest rate risk and reflects how we internally manage our
interest rate exposure.          

(3)    
    Funding consists of auction rate ABS and ABCP facilities.      

(4)    
    Assets include restricted and unrestricted cash equivalents and other overnight type instruments. Funding includes the obligation to return cash
collateral held related to derivatives exposures.          

(5)    
    Assets include receivables and other assets (including goodwill and acquired intangibles). Funding includes other liabilities and stockholders 
equity.         We use interest rate swaps and other derivatives to achieve our risk management objectives. Our
asset liability management strategy is to match assets with debt (in combination with derivatives) that have the same underlying index and reset frequency or, when economical, have interest rate characteristics that we believe are highly correlated.
The use of funding with index types and reset frequencies that are different from our assets exposes us to interest rate risk in the form of basis and repricing risk. This could result in our cost of funds not moving in the same direction or with
the same magnitude as the yield on our assets. While we believe this risk is low, as all of these indices are short-term with rate movements that are highly correlated over a long period of time, market disruptions (which have occurred in prior
years) can lead to a temporary divergence between indices resulting in a negative impact to our earnings.       Weighted Average Life

   Controls and Procedures          Disclosure
Controls and Procedures       Our management, with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial
officers, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) as of September 30, 2016. Based on
this evaluation, our chief principal executive and principal financial officers concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (a) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (b) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
chief principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.   
   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting       No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

      PART II. OTHER INFORMATION    

Item 1.   
   Legal Proceedings         We and
our subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to various claims, lawsuits and other actions that arise in the normal course of business. We believe that these claims, lawsuits and other actions will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Most of these matters are claims including individual and class action lawsuits against our servicing and collection subsidiaries by borrowers and debtors
alleging the violation of state or federal laws in connection with servicing or collection activities on their education loans and other debts.      In the ordinary course of our business, the Company, our subsidiaries and affiliates may receive information and document requests and investigative demands from state attorneys general, U.S. Attorneys,
legislative committees and administrative agencies. These requests may be informational or regulatory in nature and may relate to our business practices, the industries in which we operate, or other companies with whom we conduct business. Our
practice has been and continues to be to cooperate with these bodies and to be responsive to any such requests.      These
inquiries and the volume of related information demands are increasing the costs and resources we must dedicate to timely respond to these requests and may, depending on their outcome, result in payments of additional amounts of restitution, fines
and penalties in addition to those described below.      On March 18, 2011, an education loan borrower filed a putative class
action complaint against SLM Corporation as it existed prior to the Spin-Off ( Old SLM ) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint was captioned  Tina M. Ubaldi v. SLM Corporation et. al.  The
plaintiff brought the complaint on behalf of a putative class consisting of other similarly situated California borrowers. The complaint alleged, among other things, that Old SLM s practice of charging late fees that were proportional to the
amount of missed payments constituted liquidated damages in violation of California law and that Old SLM engaged in unfair business practices by charging daily interest on private educational loans. Following additional amendments to the complaint,
which added usury claims under California state law and two additional defendants (Sallie Mae, Inc., now known as Navient Solutions, Inc. ( NSI ), and SLM PC Student Loan Trust 2004-A), plaintiff further amended her complaint to provide
for restitution of late charges and interest paid by members of the putative class, injunctive relief, cancellation of all future interest payments, treble damages as permitted by law, as well as costs and attorneys  fees, among other relief.
Named defendants in the case are subsidiaries of Navient and as such any liability arising from the Ubaldi litigation will remain the sole responsibility of Navient Corporation. In December 2014, the court granted plaintiffs  Motion for Class
Certification with regard to claims concerning late fees, but denied the motion as to the alleged usury claims. In March 2015, the Court denied the plaintiffs  motion to further amend the complaint. The case is still pending. It is not possible
at this time to estimate a range of potential exposure, if any, for amounts that may be payable in connection therewith.      On
November 26, 2014, Marlene Blyden filed a putative class action suit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California against Navient Corporation, Navient, LLC, Navient Solutions, Inc., Navient Credit Finance Corporation,
Navient Investment Corporation, SLM Corporation, The Bank of New York, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. ( BNY Mellon ). The amended complaint, captioned  Marlene Blyden v. Navient Corporation et. al.,  alleges that
plaintiff and members of the purported class were charged and/or paid interest at a rate above that permitted under California law. Plaintiff s Second Amended Complaint dropped SLM Corporation as a defendant, added various securitization trusts
as defendants, and added claims for conversion and for money received. In July 2015, the Court granted Defendants  Motions to Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint but permitted Plaintiff to make certain amendments to the complaint. Plaintiff
filed a Third Amended Complaint in August 2015 which removed all of the Defendants except the SLM PC Student Loan 2003-B Trust, BNY Mellon (in its capacity as a trustee), and Navient Solutions, Inc. The remaining defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss
the Third Amended Complaint which was granted in February 2016. While the court   
         97

granted leave for Plaintiff to file a further amended complaint, Plaintiff instead filed a Notice of Appeal to the Ninth Circuit, appealing the District Court s decision to dismiss the Third
Amended Complaint. Allegations similar to those asserted in the Ubaldi and Blyden cases are also raised in a putative class action complaint captioned  Jamie Beechum, et al. v. Navient Solutions, Inc . filed on October 21, 2015. In
September 2016, the District Court granted our motion to dismiss and dismissed the case with prejudice. The plaintiff s period to appeal the ruling remains open. It is not possible at this time to estimate a range of potential exposure, if any,
for amounts that may be payable in connection with either the Blyden or Beechum lawsuits.      During the first quarter, Navient
Corporation, certain Navient officers and directors, and the underwriters of certain Navient securities offerings have been sued in several putative securities class action lawsuits filed on behalf of certain investors in Navient stock or Navient
unsecured debt. These cases, which were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, are:  Menold v. Navient Corporation, et al.  (filed February 11, 2016);  Jagrelius v. Navient Corporation, et al.  (filed
February 16, 2016); and  Policemen s Annuity       Benefit Fund of Chicago v. Navient Corporation, et al.  (filed February 26, 2016). On April 11, 2016, various plaintiffs filed Motions to Appoint Lead
Counsel in the lawsuits. The Court has consolidated the three pending cases and appointed Lord Abbett Funds as Lead Plaintiff. The plaintiffs filed their amended and consolidated complaint on September 28, 2016. The Navient defendants intend to
vigorously defend against the allegations in this lawsuit. At this stage in the proceedings, we are unable to anticipate the timing of resolution or the ultimate impact, if any, that the legal proceedings may have on the consolidation financial
position, liquidity, results of operations or cash-flows of Navient and its affiliates.      The Company has been named as
defendant in a number of putative class action cases alleging violations of various state and federal consumer protection laws. On May 4, 2015, Randy Johnson filed a putative action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
Indiana,  Randy Johnson v. Navient Solutions, Inc.  alleging violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act ( TCPA ). In July 2016, the District Court granted Plaintiff s Motion for Class Certification. We are unable at this
point in time to anticipate the timing of resolution or the ultimate impact, if any, that the legal proceedings may have on the consolidation financial position, liquidity, results of operations or cash-flows of Navient Corporation and its
affiliates.        Regulatory Matters        On May 2, 2014, Navient Solutions, Inc. ( NSI ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Navient, and Sallie Mae Bank entered into consent orders, without admitting any wrongdoing, with the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (the  FDIC ) (respectively, the  NSI Order  and the  Bank Order  collectively, the  FDIC Orders ) to settle matters related to certain cited violations of Section 5 of the
Federal Trade Commission Act, including the disclosures and assessments of certain late fees, as well as alleged violations under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (the  SCRA ). The FDIC Orders, which became effective upon the signing of
the consent order with the United States Department of Justice (the  DOJ ) by NSI and SLM BankCo on May 13, 2014, required NSI to pay $3.3 million in civil monetary penalties. NSI paid its civil monetary penalties. In addition, the
FDIC Orders required the establishment of a restitution reserve account totaling $30 million to provide restitution with respect to loans owned or originated by Sallie Mae Bank, from November 28, 2005 until the effective date of the FDIC
Orders. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement among SLM Corporation, SLM BankCo and Navient dated as of April 28, 2014 (the  Separation Agreement ), Navient funded the restitution reserve account in May 2014.
     The NSI Order also required NSI to ensure proper servicing for service members and proper application of SCRA benefits under
a revised and broader definition of eligibility than previously required by the statute and regulatory guidance and to make changes to billing statements and late fee practices. These changes to billing statements and late fee practices have already
been implemented. NSI also decided to voluntarily make restitution of certain late fees to all other customers whose loans were neither owned nor originated by Sallie Mae Bank. They were calculated in the same manner as that which was required under
the FDIC Orders and are estimated to be $42 million. The process to refund these fees as well as amounts from the restitution fund is complete.   
         98   

Table of Contents  

   With respect to alleged civil violations of the SCRA, NSI and Sallie Mae Bank entered into a
consent order with the DOJ in May 2014. The DOJ consent order (the  DOJ Order ) covers all loans either owned by Sallie Mae Bank or serviced by NSI from November 28, 2005 until the effective date of the settlement. The DOJ Order
required NSI to fund a $60 million settlement fund, which represents the total amount of compensation due to service members under the DOJ agreement, and to pay $55,000 in civil penalties. The DOJ Order was approved by the United States District
Court in Delaware on September 29, 2014. Shortly thereafter, Navient funded the settlement fund and paid the civil money penalties pursuant to the terms of the order. On April 15, 2015, the DOJ approved the distribution plan for the
settlement fund and the funds were disbursed in the second quarter of 2015.      The total reserves established by the Company in
2013 and 2014 to cover these costs were $177 million, and as of September 30, 2016, substantially all of this amount had been paid or credited or refunded to customer accounts. The final cost of these proceedings will remain uncertain until all
of the work under the various consent orders has been completed and the consent orders are lifted.      As previously disclosed,
the Company and various of its subsidiaries are subject to the following investigations and inquiries:       

In December 2013, Navient received Civil Investigative Demands ( CIDs ) issued by the State of Illinois Office of Attorney General and the
State of Washington Office of the Attorney General and multiple other state Attorneys General. According to the CIDs, the investigations were initiated to ascertain whether any practices declared to be unlawful under the Consumer Fraud and Deceptive
Business Practices Act have occurred or are about to occur.          

In April 2014, NSI received a CID from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the  CFPB ) as part of the CFPB s separate
investigation regarding allegations relating to Navient s disclosures and assessment of late fees and other matters. Navient has received a series of supplemental CIDs on these matters. On August 19, 2015, NSI received a letter from the
CFPB notifying NSI that, in accordance with the CFPB s discretionary Notice and Opportunity to Respond and Advise ( NORA ) process, the CFPB s Office of Enforcement is considering recommending that the CFPB take legal action
against NSI. The NORA letter relates to a previously disclosed investigation into NSI s disclosures and assessment of late fees and other matters and states that, in connection with any action, the CFPB may seek restitution, civil monetary
penalties and corrective action against NSI. The Company responded to the NORA letter on September 10, 2015.          

In November 2014, Navient s subsidiary, Pioneer Credit Recovery, Inc. ( Pioneer ), received a CID from the CFPB as part of the
CFPB s investigation regarding Pioneer s activities relating to rehabilitation loans and collection of defaulted student debt. The CFPB has informed the Company that they have combined this matter with the aforementioned servicing matter.

In December 2014, NSI received a subpoena from the New York Department of Financial Services (the  NY DFS ) as part of the NY DFS s
inquiry with regard to whether persons or entities have engaged in fraud or misconduct with respect to a financial product or service under New York Financial Services Law or other laws.      
  We have been in discussions with each of these regulatory entities or bodies and are cooperating with these investigations, inquiries or
examinations and are committed to resolving any potential concerns. It is not possible at this time to estimate a range of potential exposure, if any, for amounts that may be payable in connection with these matters and reserves have not been
established.      In addition, Navient and its subsidiaries are subject to examination or regulation by the SEC, CFPB, FDIC, ED
and various state agencies as part of its ordinary course of business. Items or matters similar to or different from those described above may arise during the course of those examinations. We also routinely receive inquiries or requests from
various regulatory entities or bodies or government agencies concerning our business or our assets. The Company endeavors to cooperate with each such inquiry or request.   
         99

   Under the terms of the Separation Agreement, Navient has agreed to indemnify SLM BankCo for
all claims, actions, damages, losses or expenses that may arise from the conduct of all activities of pre-Spin-Off SLM BankCo occurring prior to the Spin-Off other than those specifically excluded in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. As a
result, all liabilities arising out of the regulatory matters mentioned above, other than fines or penalties directly levied against Sallie Mae Bank, are the responsibility of, or assumed by, Navient or one of its subsidiaries, and Navient has
agreed to indemnify and hold harmless Sallie Mae and its subsidiaries, including Sallie Mae Bank, therefrom. Navient has no additional reserves related to indemnification matters with SLM BankCo as of September 30, 2016.   
    OIG Audit        The Office of the Inspector General (the  OIG ) of ED commenced an audit regarding Special Allowance Payments ( SAP ) on September 10, 2007. On September 25, 2013, we
received the final audit determination of Federal Student Aid (the  Final Audit Determination ) on the final audit report issued by the OIG on August 3, 2009 related to this audit. The Final Audit Determination concurred with the
final audit report issued by the OIG and instructed us to make adjustment to our government billing to reflect the policy determination. In August 2016, we filed our notice of appeal relating to this Final Audit Determination to the Administrative
Actions and Appeals Service Group of ED. This matter remains open. We continue to believe that our SAP billing practices were proper, considering then-existing ED guidance and lack of applicable regulations. The Company established a reserve for
this matter in 2014 as part of the total reserve for pending regulatory matters discussed previously and does not believe, at this time, that an adverse ruling would have a material effect on the Company as a whole.   

Item 1A.   
   Risk Factors         We face a variety of risks
that are inherent to our business and our industry generally including operational, legal and regulatory risks. Such risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, expectations and historical trends.
Except for the risks discussed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.   
    Federal funding constraints and spending policy changes triggered by associated federal spending deadlines and ongoing lawmaker and regulatory
efforts to change the student lending sector may result in disruption of federal payments for services Navient provides to the government or result in changes in various programs or policies which could materially and adversely affect Navient s
business strategy or future business prospects.        Navient receives payments from the federal government on its FFELP
Loan portfolio and for other services it provides, including servicing loans under the DSLP and providing default aversion and contingency collections to ED. Payments for these services may be affected by various factors, including the
following:       

The Budget Act enacted on December 26, 2013 includes several provisions that will have or could have an effect on Navient s
business. First, the Budget Act reduced the amount paid to guaranty agencies for defaulted FFELP Loans rehabilitated under Section 428F of the HEA, beginning on July 1, 2014. In addition, the Budget Act eliminated funding for the
Direct Loan servicing performed by not-for-profit servicers. The Budget Act requires that all servicing funding be provided through the annual appropriations process which is subject to certain limitations. Although the payments for
Navient s DSLP servicing contract is already funded from annual appropriations, the requirement to fund all servicing from the limited appropriated funding could have an effect on its future business in ways the Company cannot predict at this
time.          

Other Higher Education Legislation: As Congress considers the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, it may consider legislation that would
reduce payments to Guarantors or change the consolidation program to incentivize and/or compel education loan borrowers to refinance their existing education loans, both private and federal. Such reforms could reduce Navient s cash flows
from servicing and interest income as well as its net interest margin.      
         100

Table of Contents  

   It is possible that the Administration and Congress in the future could engage in a
prolonged debate linking the federal deficit, debt ceiling and other budget issues. If U.S. lawmakers in the future fail to reach agreement on these issues, the federal government could stop or delay payment on its obligations, including those
on services Navient provides. The upcoming Presidential election in the United States could result in significant changes (or uncertainty) in governmental policies, regulatory environments, spending sentiment and many other factors and
conditions, some of which could adversely impact Navient s business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, legislation to address the federal deficit and spending could impose proposals that would adversely affect FFELP
and DSLP-related servicing businesses. A protracted reduction, suspension or cancellation of the demand for the services Navient provides, or proposed changes to the terms or pricing of services provided under existing contracts with the
federal government, including its contract with ED, could have a material adverse effect on Navient s revenues, cash flows, profitability and business outlook, and, as a result, could materially adversely affect its business, financial
condition and results of operations. Navient cannot predict how or what programs or policies will be impacted by any actions that the Administration, Congress or the federal government may take.
