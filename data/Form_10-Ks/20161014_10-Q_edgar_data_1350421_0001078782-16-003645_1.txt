SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  
   
 To the extent that the information presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended August 31, 2016 discusses financial projections, information or expectations about our products or markets, or otherwise makes statements about future events, such statements are forward-looking. We are making these forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties are described, among other places in this Quarterly Report, in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  
   
 In addition, we disclaim any obligations to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report. When considering such forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risks referenced above and the other cautionary statements in this Quarterly Report.

PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION  
   
  ITEM 1. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited).  
   
 The accompanying condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on September 15, 2015, as amended on September 17, 2015. All numbers provided in the condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  
   
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders 
HK eBus Corporation  
   
 We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of HK eBus Corporation and the related condensed statements of income and cash flows as of August 31, 2016, and for the three month periods then ended. These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. 
   
 We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of Public Company Auditing Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of Public Company Auditing Oversight Board, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. 
   
 Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
   
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of Public Company Auditing Oversight Board, the condensed balance sheet of HK eBus Corporation as of May 31, 2016, and the related condensed statements of income, retained earnings, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated September 12, 2016 we expressed an unqualified opinion on those condensed financial statements.  
   
 The Company s audited financial statements as of May 31, 2016 and for the year then ended discloses that the Company has accumulated deficit of $7,219,239 and negative cash flow from operations amounting $38,348 for the period ended May 31, 2016. These factors as well as the uncertain conditions that the Company faces in its day-to-day operations with respect to cash flows create an uncertainty as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Our auditor s report on those financial statements includes an explanatory paragraph referring to the matters in Note 3 of those financial statements and indicating that these matters raised substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying interim financial information does not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

  NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS  
   
 HK eBus Corporation, formerly known as Rambo Medical Group, Inc., was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 18, 2005. On October 14, 2009, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to increase its shares of authorized common stock from 100,000,000 to 300,000,000 and to change its name from Cobra Oil and Gas Company to Viper Resources, Inc. The Company was formed to engage in identifying, investigating, exploring, and where determined advantageous, developing, mining, refining, and marketing oil and gas. The Company may also engage in any other business permitted by law, as designated by the Board of Directors of the Company.  On April 25, 2011, the Company s previous management was replaced in its entirety. In May 2012, the Company s management determined to discontinue its oil and gas operations, and attempt to acquire other assets or business operations that will maximize shareholder value. On August 31, 2015, the Company changed its name to HK EBUS Corporation and changed its ticker symbol to HKEB. 
   
  NOTE 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
 A summary of significant accounting policies of HK eBus Corporation (hereinafter the  Company ), a company organized in the state of Nevada (A Development Stage Company) is presented to assist in understanding the Company s financial statements. The accounting policies presented in these footnotes conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements. These financial statements and notes are representations of the Company s management who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The Company has not realized significant revenues from its planned principal business purpose and is considered to be in its development state in accordance with ASC 915,  Development Stage Entities , formerly known as SFAS 7,   Accounting and Reporting by Development State Enterprises.   
   
  Basis of Presentation  
   
 Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).  The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect, among other areas, the reported amounts of trade receivable reserves and inventory reserves, impairment of long-lived assets, and recoverability of deferred tax assets.  These estimates and assumptions also impact revenues, expenses and the disclosures in our financial statements and accompanying notes.  Although these estimates are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions.   
   
  Development Stage  
   
 The Company is currently in the development stage and has no significant operations. On August 9, 2013, the Company effected a 1-for-100 reverse split of the outstanding common stock. The accompanying financial statements and notes to the financial statements give retroactive effect to the reverse stock split for all periods presented. 
   
  Fair Value Measurements  
   
 In January 2010, the FASB ASC Topic 825,  Financial Instruments , began requiring   disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in quarterly reports as well as in annual reports.  For the Company, this statement applies to certain investments and long-term debt.  Also, FASB ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,  clarifies the definition of fair value for financial reporting, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about the use of fair value measurements. 
   
 Various inputs are considered when determining the value of the Company s investments and long-term debt.  The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities.  These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below. 
   
 Level 1   observable market inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 
 Level 2   other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, credit risk, etc.). 
 Level 3   significant unobservable inputs (including the Company s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments). 

9 

The Company s adoption of FASB ASC Topic 825 effectively at the inception did not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. 
   
 The carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value is measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs. The Company had no financial assets or liabilities carried and measured on a nonrecurring basis during the reporting periods. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared. The Company does not have financial assets as an investment carried at fair value on a recurring basis as of August 31, 2016 and 2015. 
   
 The availability of inputs observable in the market varies from instrument to instrument and depends on a variety of factors including the type of instrument, whether the instrument is actively traded, and other characteristics particular to the transaction. For many financial instruments, pricing inputs are readily observable in the market, the valuation methodology used is widely accepted by market participants, and the valuation does not require significant management discretion. For other financial instruments, pricing inputs are less observable in the market and may require management judgment. As of August 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had assets and liabilities in cash, property and equipment that were fully depreciated, and various payables. Management believes that they are being presented at their fair market value. 
   
  Use of Estimates  
   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company is subject to uncertainty of future events, economic, environmental and political factors and changes in the Company's business environment; therefore, actual results could differ from these estimates. Accordingly, accounting estimates used in the preparation of the Company's financial statements will change as new events occur and that more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the Company's operating environment changes. Changes are made in estimates as circumstances warrant. Such changes in estimates and refinement of estimation methodologies are reflected in the statements. 
   
  Cash and Cash Equivalents  
   
 Cash and cash equivalents include short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities of less than three months when acquired. The Company had $10,874 and $14,624 in cash on August 31, 2016 and May 31, 2016, respectively. The Company had no cash equivalent on August 31, 2016 and May 31, 2016. 
   
  Accounts Payable  
   
 Services and goods received from vendors and billed but not yet paid are recorded as accounts payable in periods when the services and goods were received. As of August 31, 2016, $791 was recorded as accounts payable. The balance of accounts payable was $791 and $791 as of August 31, 2016 and May 31, 2016, respectively. 
   
  NOTE 3. GOING CONCERN  
   
 Under the going concern assumption, an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation, ceasing trading, or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. 
   
 The future of the Company is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from the development of its planned business. Management has plans to seek additional capital through a public or private offering of equity or debt securities, or by other means. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty. 
   
 There can be no assurance that sufficient funds required during the next year or thereafter will be generated from operations or that funds will be available from external sources such as debt or equity financings or other potential sources. The lack of additional capital resulting from the inability to generate cash flow from the operations or to raise capital from external sources would force the Company to substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have a material adverse effect on its business. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any such required funds, if available, will be available on attractive terms or that they will not have a significant dilutive effect on the Company's existing stockholders. 

10 

The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  
   
  This report contains forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including without limitation, statements in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations regarding our financial position, estimated working capital, business strategy, the plans and objectives of our management for future operations and those statements preceded by, followed by or that otherwise include the words,  believe,   expects,   anticipates,   intends,   estimates,   projects,   target,   goal,   plans,   objective,   should,  or similar expressions or variations on such expressions are forward-looking statements. We can give no assurances that the assumptions upon which the forward-looking statements are based will prove to be correct. Because forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties including those related to changes in economic conditions, new business opportunities and general financial and business conditions, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.  
   
   The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
   
 The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed elsewhere in this quarterly report. 
   
 We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 18, 2005 to purchase, operate and develop oil and gas properties. We never achieved any revenues from our oil and gas operations and in May of 2012 determined to discontinue all such operations. We are presently attempting to acquire other assets or business operations that will maximize shareholder value. Except as discussed below, no specific assets or businesses have been definitively identified. There is no certainty that any such assets or businesses will be identified or any transactions will be consummated. 
   
 We are currently in negotiations to acquire or combine with a company that operates in the medical diagnostics industry. No definitive agreement has been reached and no assurance can be given that we will successfully complete and close the proposed acquisition or business combination. Should we fail to do so, we may seek alternative acquisitions with other companies engaged in the medical diagnostics industry or other industries. 
   
 Our plan is to locate a viable business venture in which we can participate. The selection of a business opportunity in which we may want to participate is complex and extremely risky and will be made by management in the exercise of its business judgment. There is no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire any business opportunity that will ultimately prove to be beneficial to us and our shareholders. 
   
 We are pursuing our search for a business opportunity primarily through our officers and directors, although other sources, such as professional advisors, securities broker-dealers, venture capitalists, members of the financial community, and others, may present unsolicited proposals. Our activities are subject to several significant risks that arise primarily as a result of the fact that we have no specific business and may acquire or participate in a business opportunity based on the decision of management which will, in all probability, act without the consent, vote, or approval of our shareholders. A description of the manner in which we will pursue the search for and participation in a business venture is described above. 
   
 We expect that we will need to raise funds in order to effectuate our business plans. We intend initially to seek additional investors to purchase our stock to provide us with working capital to fund our operations. Thereafter, we will seek to establish or acquire businesses or assets with additional funds raised either via the issuance of shares or debt. There can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us. We may seek to raise the required capital by other means. We may have to issue debt or equity or enter into a strategic arrangement with a third party. We currently have no agreements, arrangements or understandings with any person to obtain funds through bank loans, lines of credit or any other sources. Our inability to raise funds will have a severe negative impact on our ability to remain a viable company. In pursuing the foregoing goals, we may seek to expand or change the composition of our Board of Directors or make changes to our current capital structure, including issuing additional shares or debt and adopting a stock option plan. 
   
 Unless we complete a business combination with a revenue producing entity, we do not expect to generate any revenues over the next twelve months. Our principal business objective for the next twelve months will be to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, engage in a business combination with a private entity whose business presents an opportunity for our shareholders. 

13 

During the next twelve months, we anticipate incurring costs related to filing of reports required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), and costs relating to consummating an acquisition. We believe we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds in our treasury and additional amounts, as necessary, to be loaned by or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors, although no assurance can be given that this will prove to be the case. We have no specific plans, understandings or agreements with respect to the raising of such funds, and we may seek to raise the required capital by the issuance of equity or debt securities or by other means. We estimate that the level of working capital needed for these general and administrative costs for the next twelve months will be approximately $150,000. However, this estimate is subject to change, depending on the number of transactions in which we ultimately become involved. 
   
 In its report dated September 12, 2016, our auditor, Dave Banerjee CPA, a Professional Accountancy Corporation, expressed an opinion that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. We have generated no operating revenues since our inception. We had an accumulated deficit of $7,222,989 as of August 31, 2016. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon future events, including our ability to raise additional capital and to generate positive cash flows. 
   
 Presently, we have four full-time employees consisting of our executive officers, Dianwen Ju, Jimmy Wang, Xiao Chen and Guofeng Xu. Changes in the number of employees during the next twelve months will be a function of the level of business activity. 
   
 We intend to contract out certain technical and administrative functions on an as-needed basis in order to conduct our operating activities. Our management team will select and hire these contractors and manage and evaluate their work performance. 
             
  Results of Operations  
   
   Three Months Ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015   
   
  Revenues  
   
 We have had no revenues since our inception. 
   
  Expenses  
   
 Due to a decrease in general and administrative expenses, our operating expenses during the three month period ended August 31, 2016 decreased to $3,750 from $4,159 during the three month period ended August 31, 2015. 
   
  Net Loss  
   
 We incurred a net loss for the three month period ended August 31, 2016 of $3,750. We incurred a net loss for the three month period ended August 31, 2015 of $4,159. The decrease in net loss was directly attributable to the decrease in general and administrative expenses. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
   
 At August 31, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $178,777 compared to the working capital deficit of $175,027 at May 31, 2016. Current assets decreased to $10,874 at 167,463, 2016 from $14,624 at May 31, 2016, due to a decrease in cash. 
   
 Management will attempt to raise capital for its current operational needs through loans from related parties, debt financing, equity financing or a combination of financing options. However, there are no existing understandings, commitments or agreements for extension of outstanding notes or an infusion of capital, and there are no assurances to that effect. Moreover, the Company's need for capital may change dramatically if it acquires an interest in a business opportunity. Unless the Company can obtain additional financing, its ability to continue as a going concern is doubtful. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
   
 We have never entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements and have not formed any special purpose entities. We have not guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities or entered into any options on non-financial assets.

  ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  
   
  Evaluation of Our Disclosure Controls

Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the information relating to us, required to be disclosed in our SEC reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
   
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
   
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended August 31, 2016 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. 

15 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION  
   
    ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.  
   
 From time to time we may be involved in claims arising in connection with our business. There can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any such claim. The amount of reasonably possible losses in connection with any actions that may be brought against us could be material to our consolidated financial condition, operating results and/or cash flows. 
   
 As of the date of this Report, there are no material pending legal proceedings to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any of their property is the subject, nor are there any such proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities.
