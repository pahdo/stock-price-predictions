NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
    
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc. may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward-looking statements are characterized by future or conditional verbs such as  may,   will,   expect,   plan   intend,   anticipate,  believe,   estimate  and  continue  or similar words. You should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss future expectations and plans, which contain projections of future results of operations or financial condition or state other forward-looking information. Such statements are only predictions and our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. We do not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements as circumstances change and thus you should not unduly rely on these statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
    
  We believe that it is important to communicate future expectations to readers. However, there may be events in the future that we are not able to accurately predict or control. Risk factors that may cause such differences between predicted and actual results include, but are not limited to, those discussed in our Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
    
  These risk factors include the uncertainties associated with product development, the risk that products that appeared promising in early clinical trials do not demonstrate safety and efficacy in larger-scale clinical trials, the risk that we will not obtain approval to market our products, the risks associated with dependence upon key personnel and the need for additional financing.

1. Business Overview 
    
  Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc. ("the Company" or "Synergy") is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel gastrointestinal (GI) therapies. The Company has pioneered discovery, research and development efforts around analogs of uroguanylin, a naturally occurring human GI peptide, for the treatment of GI diseases and disorders. Synergy discovered, is developing and controls 100% worldwide rights to its proprietary uroguanylin analog platform that includes   two   lead product candidates - plecanatide and dolcanatide. Plecanatide is Synergy's first uroguanylin analog currently being evaluated for use as a once-daily tablet for chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C). Dolcanatide is Synergy's second uroguanylin analog currently being explored for ulcerative colitis.  
    
  Net cash used in operating activities was approximately   $92.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , Synergy had approximately   $109.1 million   of cash and cash equivalents. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , Synergy incurred losses from operations of   $102.9 million  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , Synergy had working capital of approximately   $87.3 million  . 
    
  On   May 5, 2016  , Synergy announced that it had entered into definitive agreements with certain institutional investors to sell   29,948,334   shares of common stock at a price of   $3.00   per share.  The shares were offered and sold directly to institutional investors by the Company in a registered direct offering conducted without an underwriter or placement agent.  The gross  proceeds from the offering were approximately   $89.8 million  .  The offering closed on May 6, 2016. 

2. Basis of Presentation 
    
  These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include Synergy and its wholly-owned subsidiaries:  (1) Synergy Advanced Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and (2) IgX, Ltd (Ireland inactive). These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared following the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim reporting. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly Synergy s interim financial information. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements as of and for the year ended   December 31, 2015   contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on   February 25, 2016  . All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
    
  Notwithstanding the Company's recent equity financing, Synergy will be required to raise additional capital within the next year to continue the development and commercialization of current product candidates and to continue to fund operations at the current cash expenditure levels. Synergy cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. To the extent that Synergy raises additional funds by issuing equity securities, Synergy s stockholders may experience significant dilution. Any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that impact Synergy s ability to conduct business. If Synergy is unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, Synergy may have to (i) significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and/or commercialization of one or more product candidates; (ii) seek collaborators for product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable and on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available; or (iii) relinquish or otherwise dispose of rights to technologies, product candidates or products that Synergy would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves on unfavorable terms. 
  Synergy's consolidated financial statements as of   December 31, 2015   and its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of   September 30, 2016   have been prepared under the assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern for the next twelve months. Synergy's independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report as of   December 31, 2015   that includes an explanatory paragraph referring to the Company's recurring and continuing losses from operations and expressing substantial doubt in the Company's ability to continue as a going concern without additional capital becoming available. Synergy's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing, attain further operating efficiencies, reduce expenditures, and, ultimately, to generate revenue. Synergy's consolidated financial statements as of   December 31, 2015   and its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of   September 30, 2016   do not include any adjustments that might result from the unfavorable outcome of this uncertainty.

3. Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ). The standard is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including the income tax impact, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02  Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 ). The FASB issued ASU 2016-02 to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Under ASU 2016-02, a lessee will recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-to-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The amendments of this ASU are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. An entity will be required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. Management is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 

4. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Available-for-sale Securities 
    
  All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the amount of cash and cash equivalents was   $109.1 million   and   $61.7 million  , respectively and consists of checking accounts and short-term U.S. Treasury money market mutual funds. Checking accounts are held at U.S. commercial banks, and balances were in excess of the FDIC insurance limit. 
    
  The Company had   no   available-for-sale securities as of   September 30, 2016   and   $50.1 million   of available-for-sale securities as of   December 31, 2015  . Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates the available-for-sale designations as of each balance sheet date. 

5. Senior Convertible Notes 
    
  On November 3, 2014, Synergy closed a private offering of   $200 million   aggregate principal amount of   7.50%   Convertible Senior Notes due 2019, (the "Notes"), including the full exercise of the over-allotment option granted to the initial purchasers to purchase an additional   $25 million   aggregate principal amount of the Notes, interest payable semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on May 1, 2015. The net proceeds from the offering were   $187.3 million   after deducting the initial purchasers  discounts and offering expenses. 
    
  The Notes are unsecured. Interest expense, not including amortization of deferred debt costs, for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $1.5 million   and   $5.9 million  , respectively. Interest expense not including amortization of deferred debt costs for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   was   $2.7 million   and   $9.9 million  , respectively. Accrued interest payable was   $2.5 million   and   $2.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   respectively.  
    
   The Notes will mature on November 1, 2019, unless earlier purchased or converted. The Notes are convertible, at any time, into shares of Synergy s common stock at an initial conversion rate of   321.5434   shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to the original conversion price of   $3.11   per share. Subsequent to the exchange described below, the principal balance of the Notes at   September 30, 2016   was   $79.2 million   as compared to   $159.0 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  Debt costs associated with the sale of the Notes of   $12.7 million   have been deferred and are being recognized as expense over the expected term of the Notes, calculated using the effective interest rate method. Amortization expense, including amortization associated with reduction of the principal due to the conversion and exchanges of the debentures on a prorated basis for   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $0.3 million   and   $4.7 million  , respectively, and for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   was   $1.5 million   and   $4.1 million  , respectively. The remaining deferred debt costs have been presented as a reduction of the Notes in accordance with the newly adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-3    Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   . 
    
  On March 18, 2016 Synergy entered into an agreement (the "Exchange") for the exchange of   $79.8 million   in aggregate principal amount of the Notes, representing approximately   50%   of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of Notes, for   35.3 million   shares of Synergy's common stock, with a total of   25.6 million   shares representing the conversion price of   $3.11

     Table of Contents  

pursuant to the existing terms of the Notes. Synergy also issued approximately   872,000   shares at the five day average share price of   $2.81   in payment of accrued and unpaid interest of   $2.4 million   on Notes accepted in the Exchanges, from the applicable last interest payment date to, but not including, March 28, 2016.  The amortization of deferred debt costs was accelerated consistent with the   50%   reduction of aggregate principal amount this transaction represented, and resulted in additional interest expense of approximately   $3.6 million  . GAAP requires that such conversions be treated as induced conversions with an expense recognized equal to the fair value of the   9.6 million   shares transferred in the transaction in excess of the fair value of the securities issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms, with such fair value being measured as of the date the inducement offer is accepted by the convertible debt holder. Accordingly, the Company recognized a debt conversion expense of   $25.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  A summary of quarterly activity and balances associated with the Notes and related deferred debt costs is presented below ($ in thousands):

6. Accounting for Share-based Payments 
    
  Stock Options 
    
  ASC Topic 718    Compensation Stock Compensation    requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the award of equity instruments based on the estimated fair value of the award at the date of grant. The expense is to be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award.  Synergy accounts for shares of common stock, stock options and warrants issued to employees based on the fair value of the stock, stock option or warrant, if that value is more reliably measurable than the fair value of the consideration or services received. 
    
  The Company accounts for stock options issued and vesting to non-employees in accordance with ASC Topic 505-50     Equity -Based Payment to Non-Employees    and accordingly the value of the stock compensation to non-employees is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached, or b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Accordingly the fair value of these options is being  marked to market  quarterly until the measurement date is determined.

     Table of Contents  

Synergy adopted the 2008 Equity Compensation Incentive Plan (the  Plan ) during the quarter ended September 30, 2008. Stock options granted under the Plan typically vest after   three years   of continuous service from the grant date and have a contractual term of   ten years  . On June 8, 2015, Synergy amended its 2008 Equity Compensation Incentive Plan and increased the number of shares of its common stock reserved for issuance under the Plan from   15,000,000   to   30,000,000  . 
    
  Stock-based compensation has been recognized in operating results as follows: 

The unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options outstanding at   September 30, 2016  , net of expected forfeitures, was approximately   $18.8 million   to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining vesting period of approximately   1.3 years  . This unrecognized compensation cost does not include amounts related to   2,159,500   shares of stock options which vest and will be measured upon a change of control. 
    
  The estimated fair value of stock option awards was determined on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model with the following weighted-average assumptions during the periods indicated. 

A summary of stock option activity and of changes in stock options outstanding under the Plan is presented below: 

__________________________ 
  (1)   Number of options represented above includes   2,159,500   options vesting upon a change of control, granted between November 20, 2009 and June 22, 2010. The fair value at the date of grant was approximately   $28.6 million  . Because the probability of a change of control transaction is not predictable   no   stock based compensation expense associated with these options has been recognized since the grant date.

7. Stockholders  Equity/(Deficit) 
    
  On March 18, 2016, Synergy entered into an exchange agreement for the exchange of   $79.8 million   in aggregate principal amount of the Notes, representing approximately   50%   of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of Notes, for   35.3 million   shares of Synergy's common stock, with a total of   25.6 million   shares representing the conversion price of   $3.11   pursuant to the existing terms of the Notes. Synergy also issued approximately   872,000   shares at the five day average share price of   $2.81   in payment of accrued and unpaid interest of   $2.4 million   on Notes accepted in the Exchanges. In addition, Synergy issued   9.6 million   shares of common stock as an inducement for Note holders to convert. 
       
  On   May 5, 2016  , Synergy announced that it had entered into definitive agreements with certain institutional investors to sell   29,948,334   shares of common stock at a price of   $3.00   per share.  The shares were offered and sold directly to institutional investors by the company in a registered direct offering conducted without an underwriter or placement agent.  The gross proceeds from the offering were approximately   $89.8 million  .  The offering closed on May 6, 2016. 

8. Research and Development Expense 
    
  Research and development costs include expenditures in connection with an in-house research and development laboratory, salaries and staff costs, application and filing for regulatory approval of proposed products, regulatory and scientific consulting fees, as well as contract research, patient costs, drug formulation and tableting, data collection, monitoring, and clinical insurance. 
    
  In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 730-10-55,   Research and Development  , Synergy recorded prepaid research and development costs of approximately   $1.4 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $3.1 million   as of   December 31, 2015  , for nonrefundable advances for production of drug substance and analytical testing services for its drug candidates. In accordance with this guidance, Synergy expenses these costs when drug compound is delivered and services are performed. 
    
  The Company will record inventory, manufactured for sale of a product candidate, when the product candidate is considered to have a high likelihood of regulatory approval and the related costs are expected to be recoverable through sales. In determining whether or not to record such inventories, the Company evaluates, among other factors, information regarding the product candidate's safety and efficacy, the status of regulatory submissions and communications with regulatory authorities and the outlook for commercial sales.  As of September 30, 2016, all costs associated with batches of inventory, manufactured for sale of a product candidates, had not met the inventory capitalization criteria and have been charged to research and development expense as incurred.

ASC Topic 815-40 clarifies the determination of whether an instrument issued by an entity (or an embedded feature in the instrument) is indexed to an entity s own stock, which would qualify as a scope exception under ASC Topic 815-10. 
    
  Based upon the Company s analysis of the criteria contained in ASC Topic 815-40, Synergy has determined that certain warrants issued in connection with sale of its common stock must be classified as derivative instruments. In accordance with ASC Topic 815-40, these warrants are also being re-measured at each balance sheet date based on estimated fair value, and any resultant changes in fair value are being recorded in the Company s statement of operations. The Company estimates the fair value of certain warrants using the   Black-Scholes   option pricing model in order to determine the associated derivative instrument liability and change in fair value described above. The range of assumptions used to determine the fair value of the warrants at each period end was: 

Fair value of stock is the closing market price of the Company s common stock at the end of each reporting period when the derivative instruments are marked to market. Expected volatility is a management estimate of future volatility, over the expected warrant term, based on historical volatility of Synergy s common stock. The warrants have a transferability provision and based on guidance provided in SAB 107 for instruments issued with such a provision, Synergy used the full contractual term as the expected term of the warrants. The risk free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury security rates for maturities consistent with the expected remaining term of the warrants at the date quarterly revaluation. 
    
  The following table sets forth the components of changes in the Synergy s outstanding warrants which were deemed derivative financial instruments and the associated liability balance for the periods indicated: 

10. Fair Value Measurements 
    
  Financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities, accounts payable and derivative instruments. These financial instruments are stated at their respective historical carrying amounts, which approximate fair value due to their short term nature, except for available-for-sale securities and derivative instruments which are marked to market at the end of each reporting period. 
    
  The value of Senior Convertible Notes is stated at its carrying value at   September 30, 2016  . The Company believes it could obtain borrowings at   September 30, 2016   at comparable interest rates as the November 2014 Notes, therefore, the carrying value approximates fair value.

  ($ in thousands) 

The unrealized gains or losses on the derivative liabilities are recorded as a change in fair value of derivative liabilities in the Company s statement of operations. A financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. At each reporting period, Synergy reviews the assets and liabilities that are subject to ASC Topic 815-40. At each reporting period, all assets and liabilities for which the fair value measurement is based on significant unobservable inputs or instruments which trade infrequently and therefore have little or no price transparency are classified as Level 3. 

11. Loss per Share 
    
  Basic and diluted net loss per share is presented in conformity with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share, ( ASC Topic 260 ) for periods presented. In accordance with ASC Topic 260, basic and diluted net loss per common share was determined by dividing net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted weighted-average shares are the same as basic weighted-average shares because shares issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options and warrants would be antidilutive. 
    
  The following table sets forth potential common shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options, the exercise of warrants, and the conversion of the Senior Convertible Notes, all of which have been excluded from the computation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding as they would be anti-dilutive, including the impact on dilutive net loss per share of in-the-money warrants as per ASC 260-10-45-35 through  ASC 260-10-45-37:

  Business Overview 
    
  Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel gastrointestinal (GI) therapies. We have pioneered discovery, research and development efforts around analogs of uroguanylin, a naturally occurring human GI peptide, for the treatment of GI diseases and disorders. We discovered, are developing and control 100% worldwide rights to our proprietary uroguanylin analog platform that includes two lead product candidates - plecanatide and dolcanatide. 
    
  Plecanatide 
    
  Plecanatide is our first uroguanylin analog currently being evaluated for use as a once-daily tablet for chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C). Plecanatide is a peptide made up of 16 amino acids and, with the exception of a single amino acid substitution, it is identical to uroguanylin. Plecanatide is the first investigational drug designed to replicate the function of uroguanylin, a naturally occurring and endogenous human GI peptide which acts in a pH-dependent manner targeting guanylate cyclase-C (GC-C) receptors primarily in the proximal small intestine. Plecanatide stimulates fluid secretion and promotes stool consistency necessary to support normal bowel function. 
    
  The plecanatide new drug application (NDA) in CIC is currently under review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the FDA Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date is January 29, 2017. In addition, patient enrollment has been completed in the two double-blind placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trials with plecanatide in IBS-C. Top-line data from both trials are expected by the end of this year. Pending approval in the CIC indication, we plan to file a New Drug Application Supplement with Clinical Data (sNDA) for plecanatide in IBS-C in the first quarter of 2017. 
    
  Dolcanatide 
    
   Dolcanatide is our second uroguanylin analog currently being explored for ulcerative colitis. Dolcanatide is designed to replicate the activity of uroguanylin with enhanced resistance to standard digestive breakdown by proteases in the intestine. In January 2016, we announced positive proof-of-concept with dolcanatide in a phase 1b trial evaluating 28 patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. We are planning to meet with regulatory agencies to discuss phase 2 clinical development plans for dolcanatide in mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. In November 2014, we reported successful proof-of-concept with dolcanatide in a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial in 289 patients with OIC, demonstrating the utility of our uroguanylin analog platform in OIC.

Recent Developments 
    
  Plecanatide CIC Development Update 

The plecanatide new drug application (NDA) in chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) is currently under review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date is January 29, 2017.  Plecanatide is the first investigational therapy designed to replicate the activity of uroguanylin, a naturally occurring human GI peptide, by working locally primarily in the proximal small intestine to stimulate digestive fluid movement and support regular bowel function.  

The late-cycle review meeting with the FDA was completed and no significant issues were identified. The FDA previously informed us that there are no plans at this time for an advisory committee meeting in connection with the review of the plecanatide NDA in CIC. The plecanatide NDA in CIC is supported by two double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trials and one long-term open-label safety study. Over 3,500 patients have been exposed to plecanatide in the CIC clinical development program.  

Two posters were presented on the plecanatide CIC clinical data at the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) annual scientific meeting in October 2016.   
                
    Safety and Tolerability of Plecanatide in Patients with Chronic Idiopathic Constipation: Long-term Evidence from an Open-Label Study 
                
    Data presented from the long-term open-label safety study showed plecanatide was associated with low adverse events and low discontinuation rates in patients with CIC who received plecanatide (3 mg or 6 mg) once-daily for up to 72 weeks. The most common adverse events were diarrhea (7.1%) and urinary tract infection (2.2%). The remainder of adverse events occurred in less than 2% of patients treated with plecanatide. Adverse events leading to discontinuation occurred in 5.3% of patients treated with plecanatide, with discontinuation due to diarrhea occurring in 3.1% of patients. In addition, this study asked patients about level of treatment satisfaction and desire to continue treatment. The median score for treatment satisfaction was 4.0 (4=quite satisfied) and for continuation of treatment was 4.0 (4=quite likely).  
                
    Efficacy and Safety of Plecanatide in the Treatment of Chronic Idiopathic Constipation (CIC): Pooled Results from Two Phase 3 Studies 
                
    Pooled results from two previously reported double-blind placebo-controlled phase 3 CIC trials confirmed patients treated with plecanatide showed a significantly greater response rate of durable overall complete spontaneous bowel movements compared to placebo (20.5% in 3 mg and 19.8% in 6mg dose groups compared to11.5% in placebo; p 0.001 for both doses). This is the primary endpoint defined by the FDA for regulatory approval in CIC. This integrated analysis also showed consistent safety data with adverse event rates similar across plecanatide-treatment groups and placebo (30.6% in 3 mg and 31.1% in 6 mg dose groups compared to 28.7% in placebo). Diarrhea was the most common adverse event (4.6% in 3 mg and 5.1% in 6 mg compared to 1.3% in placebo). Discontinuation rates were low across all treatment groups (4.1% in 3.0 mg and 4.5% in 6.0 mg dose groups compared to 2.2% in placebo). 
       
  Plecanatide IBS-C Development Update 

Patient enrollment has been completed in the two double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trials with plecanatide in IBS-C patients. Top-line data in both trials are expected by the end of this year. The primary endpoint in both trials is the percentage of patients who are Overall Responders during the 12-week treatment period. An Overall Responder, as defined by the FDA, is a patient who is a weekly responder (i.e. meets both a 30% abdominal pain intensity reduction and stool frequency increase criteria in the same week) for at least 6 of the 12 treatment weeks. Plecanatide previously met this endpoint in a phase 2b trial with 424 IBS-C patients that was completed in 2014. 

The IBS-C pre-NDA meeting with the FDA was completed in September 2016. Pending approval of plecanatide in the CIC indication, we plan to file a New Drug Application Supplement with Clinical Data (sNDA) for plecanatide in IBS-C in the first quarter of 2017 and expect a 10-month review period from submission.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016   AND   SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 
    
  We had   no   revenues during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and three corresponding months in   2015   because we do not have any commercial biopharmaceutical products.

     Table of Contents  

Research and development expenses for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   ( Current Year Quarter ) increased approximately   $4.2 million   or   20.6%  , to approximately   $24.6 million   from approximately   $20.4 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   ( Prior Year Quarter ). This increase in research and development expenses was due primarily to greater spending on IBS-C studies, additional Technical Operations headcount and consulting services, and plecanatide API and drug product costs of validation batches manufactured in preparation for our anticipated commercial launch. 
    
  The following table sets forth our research and development expenses directly related to our product candidates, as well as indirect costs, for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Direct expenses include external costs associated with chemistry, manufacturing and controls including costs of drug substance and product formulation, as well as preclinical studies and clinical trial costs. 

Indirect research and development costs which are comprised of in-house staff compensation, facilities, depreciation, stock-based compensation and research and development support services, are not directly allocated to specific drug candidates. Indirect costs were approximately   $3.7 million   in the Current Year, as compared to approximately   $2.3 million   during the Prior Year representing an increase of approximately   $1.4 million   which was primarily due to higher stock based compensation and employee compensation expenses. The increase in employee compensation reflects the cost of  building a Technical Operations function fully prepared for the anticipated commercial launch of plecanatide during first quarter 2017. 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately   $11.2 million   or   414.8%  , to   $13.9 million   for the Current Quarter from approximately   $2.7 million   for the Prior Quarter. These increased expenses primarily reflect the cost of building a Commercial Organization prepared to launch plecanatide during the first quarter of 2017. These costs include approximately a   $5.1 million   increase in commercial preparedness and planning expenses, a   $4.3 million   increase in stock compensation expense, and a   $1.3 million   increase in employee compensation and benefits costs. 
    
  Net loss for the Current Year Quarter was   $40.2 million   as compared to a net loss of a   $26.0 million   for the Prior Year Quarter. In addition to the operating items discussed above, this increase in our net loss of   $14.2 million   or   54.6%   was a result of a   $1.5 million   increase in the fair value of our derivative instruments, partially offset by approximately a   $1.2 million   decrease in the amortization of our deferred debt costs and   $1.2 million   decrease in interest expense, both related to the conversion of our convertible debt. 
    
  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016   AND   SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 
    
  We had   no   revenues during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and nine corresponding months in   2015   because we do not have any commercial biopharmaceutical products. 
    
  Research and development expenses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   ( Current Year Period ) increased approximately   $14.3 million   or   24.6%  , to approximately   $72.4 million   from approximately   $58.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   ( Prior Year Period ). This increase in research and development expenses was due primarily to greater spending on IBS-C studies, expenses related to filing our CIC NDA in January 2016, additional compensation, consulting services, and plecanatide API and drug product manufacturing costs for validation batches prepared in anticipation of our commercial launch of plecanatide for CIC during the first quarter of 2017. The increase in compensation reflects the cost of  building a Technical Operations function fully prepared for the anticipated commercial launch of plecanatide during first quarter 2017.

Indirect research and development costs are comprised of in-house staff compensation, facilities, depreciation, stock-based compensation and research and development support services which are not directly allocated to specific drug candidates. Indirect costs were approximately   $11.0 million   in the Current Year Period, as compared to approximately   $7.1 million   during the Prior Year Period representing an increase of approximately   $3.9 million   which were primarily due to an increase in employee compensation of   $1.8 million  , higher stock based compensation of   $0.9 million   and $1.0 million increase in consulting services related to systems and packaging design. The increase in compensation reflects the cost of  building a Technical Operations function fully prepared for the anticipated commercial launch of plecanatide during first quarter 2017. 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately   $15.8 million   or   107.5%  , to   $30.5 million   for the Current Year Period from approximately   $14.7 million   for the Prior Year Period. These increased expenses primarily reflect the cost of building a Commercial Organization prepared to launch plecanatide during first quarter 2017. These costs included approximately a   $10.6 million   increase in commercial preparedness and planning expenses, a   $1.2 million   increase in consulting, and a   $2.8 million   increase in compensation and benefit costs. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   we had 61 full-time employees compared to 44 full-time employees at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Net loss for the Current Year Period was   $138.7 million   compared to a net loss of   $87.1 million   for the Prior Year Period. In addition to the operating items discussed above, this increase in our net loss of   $51.6 million   or   59.2%   was primarily a result of debt conversion expense of approximately   $25.6 million   resulting from our March 2016 convertible notes exchange and an increase in the amortization of our deferred debt costs of   $0.6 million  , partially offset by a decrease of approximately   $4.0 million   in interest expense related to our convertible notes and a decrease of   $0.6 million   in the fair value of our derivative instruments. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately   $109.1 million   in cash and cash equivalents, compared to approximately   $111.8 million   in cash, cash equivalents and available for sale securities as of   December 31, 2015  . Net cash used in operating activities was   $92.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   $70.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . As of   September 30, 2016   we had working capital of   $87.3 million  , as compared to working capital of   $95.5 million   on   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  On   May 5, 2016   we announced that we had entered into definitive agreements with certain institutional investors to sell   29,948,334   shares of common stock at a price of   $3.00   per share.  The shares were offered and sold directly to institutional investors by us in a registered direct offering conducted without an underwriter or placement agent.  The gross proceeds from the offering were approximately   $89.8 million  .  The offering closed on May 6, 2016. 
    
  On March 28, 2016, we announced the closing of separate, privately-negotiated exchanges with eligible holders of approximately   50%   of our outstanding   7.50%   Convertible Senior Notes ( Notes ) due 2019. At the closing, and in satisfaction of the consideration for   $79.8 million   in aggregate principal amount of the Notes, we issued   35.3 million   shares of our common stock (the  Shares ). We also issued approximately   872,000   Shares in payment of accrued and unpaid interest on Notes accepted in the Exchanges from the applicable last interest payment date to, but not including, March 28, 2016. A total of   25.6 million   shares carried a conversion price of   $3.11   pursuant to the existing terms of the Notes.    $79.2 million   of the Notes remain outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  .

Notwithstanding our May 2016 sale of common stock, we will be required to raise additional capital to continue the development and commercialization of current product candidates and to continue to fund operations at the current cash expenditure levels. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Recently worldwide economic conditions and the international equity and credit markets have significantly deteriorated and may remain difficult for the foreseeable future. These developments may make it more difficult to obtain additional equity or credit financing, when needed. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution. Any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that impact our ability to (i) conduct, delay, scale back or discontinue the development and/or commercialization of one or more product candidates; (ii) seek collaborators for product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable and on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available; or (iii) relinquish or otherwise dispose of rights to technologies, product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves on unfavorable terms. 
  Our consolidated financial statements as of   December 31, 2015   and our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of   September 30, 2016   have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern for the next twelve months. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report as of   December 31, 2015   that includes an explanatory paragraph referring to our recurring and continuing losses from operations and expressing substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern without additional capital becoming available. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing, attain further operating efficiencies, reduce expenditures, and, ultimately, to generate revenue. Our consolidated financial statements as of   December 31, 2015   and our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of   September 30, 2016   do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Financial Reporting Release No. 60 requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements. Our accounting policies are described in ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA of our Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for year ended   December 31, 2015  , filed with the SEC on   February 25, 2016  . There have been no other changes to our critical accounting policies since   December 31, 2015  . 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
    
  We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of   September 30, 2016  . 

ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  Our exposure to market risk on the fair values of certain assets is related to credit risk associated with bank checking accounts and securities held in money market mutual funds. As of    September 30, 2016  , we held   $109.1 million   in checking and U.S. Treasury based mutual funds. Our cash and cash equivalents balances are in excess of Federally insured limits. We believe our cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities do not contain excessive risk, however we cannot provide absolute assurance that in the future our investments will not be subject to adverse changes in market value. 

ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Based on an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) required by paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that as of    September 30, 2016  , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitations, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only

reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
    
  As required by Rule 13a-15(d) of the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that could significantly affect internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  .
