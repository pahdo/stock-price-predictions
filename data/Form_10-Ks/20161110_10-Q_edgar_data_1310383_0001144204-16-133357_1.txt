NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  

  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  

  (Unaudited)  

1. Organization  

Summit Healthcare REIT, Inc. ( Summit )
is a real estate investment trust that owns 100% of five properties, 95% of six properties and a 10% equity interest in an investment
that holds 17 properties. Summit is a Maryland corporation, formed in 2004 under the General Corporation Law of Maryland for
the purpose of engaging in the business of investing in and owning real estate. As used in these notes, the  Company ,
 we ,  us  and  our  refer to Summit and its consolidated subsidiaries, except where the context
otherwise requires. 

Generally, we conduct substantially all
of our operations through Summit Healthcare Operating Partnership, L.P. (the  Operating Partnership ), which is a Delaware
limited partnership. As of September 30, 2016, we own a 99.88% general partner interest in the Operating Partnership, and
Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC ( CRA ), owns a 0.12% limited partnership interest. Our financial statements
and the financial statements of the Operating Partnership are consolidated in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements. 

Cornerstone Healthcare Partners LLC   

We own 95% of Cornerstone Healthcare Partners
LLC ( CHP LLC ), which was formed in 2012, and the remaining 5% non-controlling interest is owned by Cornerstone Healthcare
Real Estate Fund, Inc. ( CHREF ), an affiliate of CRA. CHP LLC is consolidated with our financial statements and owns
six properties (the  JV Properties ). 

As of September 30, 2016, we own a 95.3%
interest in five of the JV Properties, and CHREF owns a 4.7% interest. We continue to own a 95% interest in the sixth JV Property,
and CHREF owns a 5% interest. See Note 12 for further information regarding the sale of one of the JV Properties in October 2016. 

Friendswood TRS   

Friendswood TRS ( Friendswood TRS )
is our wholly-owned, taxable REIT subsidiary ( TRS ), which is the licensed operator and tenant of Friendship Haven
Healthcare and Rehabilitation Center ( Friendship Haven ) (see Note 3). 

Summit Union Life Holdings, LLC   

On April 29, 2015, through our Operating
Partnership, we entered into a limited liability company agreement (as such agreement may be amended from time to time, the  SUL
LLC Agreement ) with Best Years, LLC ( Best Years ), an unrelated entity and a U.S.-based affiliate of Union
Life Insurance Co, Ltd. (a Chinese corporation), and formed Summit Union Life Holdings, LLC (the  SUL JV ). The SUL
JV is not consolidated in our condensed consolidated financial statements and is accounted for under the equity-method in the Company s
condensed consolidated financial statements (see Note 5). As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we have a 10% interest
in the SUL JV. As of September 30, 2016, the SUL JV owned 17 properties and as of December 31, 2015, the SUL JV owned 14 properties. 

Summit Fantasia Holdings, LLC   

On September 27, 2016, through
our Operating Partnership, we entered into a limited liability company agreement ( Fantasia LLC Agreement )
with Fantasia Investment III LLC ( Fantasia ), an unrelated entity and a U.S.-based affiliate of Fantasia
Holdings Group Co., Limited (a Chinese corporation), and formed Summit Fantasia Holdings, LLC (the  Fantasia
JV ). The Fantasia JV is not consolidated in our condensed consolidated financial statements and will be accounted for
under the equity-method in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. There were no activities
conducted by the Fantasia JV from September 27, 2016 through September 30, 2016. See Note 12.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

For more information regarding our significant
accounting policies and estimates, please refer to  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  contained in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC )
on March 18, 2016. There have been no material changes to our policies since that filing, except as noted below under Recently
Adopted Accounting Pronouncements. 

The accompanying condensed consolidated
balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date. We assume
that users of these condensed consolidated financial statements have read or have access to the audited December 31, 2015 consolidated
financial statements and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 18, 2016 and that the adequacy
of additional disclosure needed for a fair presentation, except in regard to material contingencies, may be determined in that
context. Accordingly, footnotes and other disclosures which would substantially duplicate those contained in our most recent Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 have been omitted in this report. 

Principles of Consolidation and Basis
of Presentation   

The accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and CHP LLC (of which the Company owns 95%).
All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

The accompanying financial information
reflects all adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management, of a normal recurring nature and necessary for a fair presentation
of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods. Interim results of operations are not
necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Operating results for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. 

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements   

On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted
the     Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No.
2015-03,  Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.  The amendments
in this ASU require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct
deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The Company s condensed consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 has been retroactively restated for the effect of adopting this ASU, which resulted in a
decrease to total assets of approximately $1.3 million and a decrease in loans payable, net of debt discounts, and total liabilities
of approximately $1.3 million. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

In November 2016, the FASB has issued ASU No. 2016-17,  Consolidation
(Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control.  The amendments affect reporting entities
that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate a variable interest entity in certain situations involving entities
under common control. Specifically, the amendments change the evaluation of whether a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary
of a variable interest entity by changing how a reporting entity that is a single decision maker of a variable interest entity
treats indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity. 

The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted 

The FASB
has issued ASU No. 2016-15,    Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of
Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ,   to address diversity in how certain cash
receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  

The amendments provide guidance on the
following eight specific cash flow issues: 

Debt Prepayment or Debt Extinguishment Costs;   

Settlement of Zero-Coupon Debt Instruments or Other Debt Instruments with Coupon Interest Rates
That Are Insignificant in Relation to the Effective Interest Rate of the Borrowing;   

Contingent Consideration Payments Made after a Business Combination;   

Proceeds from the Settlement of Insurance Claims;   

Proceeds from the Settlement of Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Policies, including Bank-Owned;
Life Insurance Policies;   

Distributions Received from Equity Method Investees;   

Beneficial Interests in Securitization Transactions; and   

Separately Identifiable Cash Flows and Application of the Predominance Principle.   

The amendments are effective for public
business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption
is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. 

The amendments should be applied using
a retrospective transition method to each period presented. If it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for
some of the issues, the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements when adopted. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,
 Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  ( ASU
2016-13 ). ASU 2016-13 requires that a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis
be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted
from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected
on the financial asset. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 are an improvement because they eliminate the probable initial recognition
threshold in current GAAP and, instead, reflect an entity s current estimate of all expected credit losses. Previously, when
credit losses were measured under GAAP, an entity generally only considered past events and current conditions in measuring the
incurred loss. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2019,
with early adoption permitted as of the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. An entity will apply the amendments in
this update through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which
the guidance is effective (that is, a modified-retrospective approach). The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance
will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements when adopted. 

The FASB has issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation
- Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  The amendments are intended
to improve the accounting for employee share-based payments and affect all organizations that issue share-based payment awards
to their employees. 

Several aspects of the accounting for share-based
payment award transactions are simplified, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards
as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. 

For public companies, the amendments are
effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption
is permitted for any organization in any interim or annual period. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption
of the new standard on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

The FASB has issued ASU No. 2016-07,  Investments
- Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting.  The amendments
affect all entities that have an investment that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting as a result of an increase
in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. 

The amendments eliminate the requirement
that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or
degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step
basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The amendments
require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis
of the investor s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes
qualified for equity method accounting. Therefore, upon qualifying for the equity method of accounting, no retroactive adjustment
of the investment is required. 

The amendments require that an entity that
has an available-for-sale equity security that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting recognize through earnings
the unrealized holding gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for
use of the equity method. 

The amendments are effective for all entities
for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments should be applied
prospectively upon their effective date to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that result in the
adoption of the equity method. Earlier application is permitted. The Company has evaluated the impact of this new standard and
does not expect it to have a significant effect on the condensed consolidated financial statements, when adopted. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-02,  Leases . The new standard requires a lessor to classify leases as either sales-type, finance or operating. A lease
will be treated as a sale if it transfers all of the risks and rewards, as well as control of the underlying asset, to the lessee.
If risks and rewards are conveyed without the transfer of control, the lease is treated as a financing. If the lessor doesn t
convey risks and rewards or control, an operating lease results. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required
for lessors for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest
comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. We are currently evaluating
the impact of our pending adoption of the new standard on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

The FASB has issued ASU No. 2015-14,  Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date.  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).  The amendments in ASU 2015-14 defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities
by one year. Public business entities should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. We are currently
evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our condensed consolidated financial statements which we will adopt
in 2018. 

Reclassifications   

Certain amounts in the Company s
condensed consolidated financial statements for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
Based on the intended use of the restricted cash, we have classified changes in restricted cash within the statements of cash flows
as operating and investing activities and the prior period presentation has been revised to conform to this classification. These
reclassifications had no effect on previously reported results of operations.  Additionally, see Recently Adopted Accounting
Pronouncements above. 

3. Investments in Real Estate Properties  

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, our investments in real estate properties, including those acquired through our subsidiaries and CHP, LLC, but excluding

was approximately $2.7 million and $3.0 million, respectively.

Upon becoming the licensed operator and tenant of the facility, we entered into a two-year management agreement with an affiliate of Stonegate Senior Living ( Stonegate ), whereby Stonegate will receive a management fee equal to 6% of the adjusted gross revenues as defined, from operations of the facility. In October 2015, we amended the management agreement with Stonegate to increase the term from two years to 12 years (see Note 10).

to the SUL JV in December 2015 (see Notes 5 and 11). 

Littleton, New Hampshire  

On November 17, 2015, through a wholly-owned
subsidiary, we acquired Riverglen House, a 59-bed assisted living facility located in Littleton, New Hampshire, ( Riverglen )
for a purchase price of $8.5 million, which was funded through cash on hand plus the proceeds from the loan assumed and described
in Note 4 under Housing and Healthcare Finance, LLC ( HHF ). Riverglen is leased pursuant to a 15-year triple net lease. 

On February 29, 2016, we received an executed
commitment from Best Years, our SUL JV partner, of its intent to participate in the contribution of Riverglen to the SUL JV. On
April 28, 2016, we completed the process of executing a modified transfer of physical assets ( TPA ) agreement for
the loan agreement with HHF (see Note 4), a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) insured loan.
We legally could not complete the contribution of Riverglen to the SUL JV until we received approval from HUD and then the TPA
process was completed. 

As of April 29, 2016, Riverglen was contributed
to the SUL JV and is no longer consolidated in our condensed consolidated financial statements (see Note 11). 

Leasing Commissions   

Leasing commissions paid to CRA prior to
termination of our advisory agreement with CRA on April 1, 2014 are capitalized at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis
over the related lease term. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, total costs incurred were $2.2 million and the unamortized
balance of capitalized leasing commissions was approximately $1.6 million. Amortization expense for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 was $40,000 and $40,000, respectively. Amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 was $121,000 and $121,000, respectively.   

4. Loans Payable  

In April 2015, we formed the SUL JV with
Best Years and contributed six properties ( JV 2 Properties ) to the SUL JV. As part of the contribution of the JV
2 Properties, approximately $30.4 million of loans payable were transferred to the SUL JV upon disposition of the JV 2 Properties
(approximately $10.6 million from GE Capital Corporation and $19.8 million from The PrivateBank and Trust Company). In April 2016,
we contributed Riverglen, including the related loan payable of approximately $4.7 million, to the SUL JV. See Notes 5 and 11 for
further information regarding the contribution and disposition of real estate properties. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, loans payable
consisted of the following: 

We have total debt obligations of approximately
$60.5 million that will mature between 2018 and 2051. See Note 3 for loans payable balance for each property. All of the loans
payable have certain financial and non-financial covenants, including ratios and financial statement considerations. As of September
30, 2016 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants or have received waivers. 

In connection with our loans payable, we
incurred debt issuance costs. The unamortized balance of the debt discounts totals $2.1 million and $2.3 million, as
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (retrospectively reclassified as of January 1, 2016   see Note 2), respectively.
These debt discounts are being amortized over the life of their respective financing agreements using the straight-line basis which
approximates the effective interest rate method. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $34,000 and $42,000,
respectively, of debt discounts were amortized and included in interest expense in our condensed consolidated statements of
operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $103,000 and $172,000, respectively, of debt discounts
were amortized and included in interest expense in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

During the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred approximately $0.7 million and $0.7 million, respectively, of interest expense
(excluding debt discounts amortization) related to our loans payable. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, we incurred approximately $2.2 million and $2.5 million, respectively, of interest expense (excluding debt
discounts amortization) related to our loans payable.    

The principal payments due on the
loans payable (excluding debt discounts) for the period from  October 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016 and for each of the four
following years and thereafter ending December 31 are as follows: 

Healthcare Financial Solutions, LLC (formerly known as
GE Capital Corporation ( GE ))   

On October 6, 2015, we refinanced our existing
GE loan for the Friendship Haven facility with a secured term loan agreement with Oxford Finance, LLC ( Oxford ) (see
below for further information   Oxford Finance, LLC) and the funds received were used to pay off the outstanding principal
balance for this property. 

On October 6, 2015, we refinanced our existing
GE loan for the Brookstone of Aledo facility with Lancaster Pollard (see below for further information   Lancaster Pollard)
and the funds received were used to pay off the outstanding principal balance for this property. 

On October 30, 2015, the GE loan agreement
for the Sundial Assisted Living property located in Redding was amended and restated. The amended loan is with Healthcare Financial
Solutions, LLC ( HFS  (formerly GE)). The loan is interest only through January 2017 and then the loan payments increase
to approximately $15,000 a month, including interest. 

The PrivateBank and Trust Company ( PrivateBank )   

On December 21, 2015, we refinanced our
existing loan for the Danby House facility with Lancaster Pollard (see below for further information   Lancaster Pollard)
and the funds received were used to pay off the outstanding principal balance for this property. 

As of December 31, 2015, we had no borrowings
under the PrivateBank loans. 

Lancaster Pollard Mortgage Company, LLC    

In 2015 and 2014, we refinanced certain
properties with HUD insured loans from the Lancaster Pollard Mortgage Company, LLC ( Lancaster Pollard ). See table
above for further information. HUD requires that our lender hold certain reserves for property tax, insurance, and capital expenditures.
These reserves are included in restricted cash on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

Oxford Finance, LLC   

On October 6, 2015, we refinanced our existing
GE loan for the Friendship Haven facility with a secured term loan agreement with Oxford. The loan is interest only through October
2016 and then the loan payments increase to approximately $51,000 a month, including interest. 

Housing and Healthcare Finance, LLC ( HHF )   

On November 17, 2015, in conjunction with
the purchase of Riverglen (see Note 3), we entered into a Modification, Release, and Assumption Agreement with HHF and assumed
the outstanding HUD insured loan. On April 29, 2016, Riverglen was contributed to the SUL JV (see Notes 3, 5 and 11). 

5. Equity-Method Investment   

SUL JV   

In April 2015, we formed the SUL JV, which
is owned 10% by the Operating Partnership and 90% by Best Years. The SUL JV will continue until an event of dissolution occurs,
as defined in the SUL LLC Agreement. We account for our investment using the equity-method. 

In conjunction with the formation of the
SUL JV, the Operating Partnership contributed to the SUL JV all of the JV 2 Properties (see Note 11). This contribution increased
our equity-method investment by approximately $1.0 million. 

In April 2015, the Operating Partnership
recorded a receivable for approximately $362,000 for distributions that could not be paid prior to the contribution of the JV 2
Properties due to cash restrictions related to the loans payable for the contributed JV 2 Properties. As of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, the receivable of $362,000 due from the JV 2 properties is included in tenant and other receivables on our
condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

In October 2015, the SUL JV acquired four
additional properties located in Texas which increased our equity-method investment by approximately $0.8 million. 

On December 24, 2015, we contributed the
Cottage Properties, which we had acquired in November 2015, to the SUL JV (see Notes 3, 4 and 11). This contribution increased
our equity-method investment by approximately $0.5 million. 

On April 29, 2016, we contributed Riverglen
located in Littleton, New Hampshire (see Note 3) to the SUL JV. This contribution resulted in the SUL JV owning Riverglen and,
therefore, Riverglen is no longer consolidated in our condensed consolidated financial statements as of April 29, 2016. The aggregate
net value of Riverglen at the date of the contribution was approximately $3.9 million, which approximated the Operating Partnership s
carrying value on the date of contribution (total assets were approximately $9.2 million less liabilities of approximately $5.3
million, which included approximately $4.7 million in a HUD insured loan payable (see Note 4)). Concurrent with the contribution
of Riverglen, Best Years contributed cash to the SUL JV in the amount of approximately $3.4 million and the Operating Partnership
received cash of approximately $3.4 million from the SUL JV, not including approximately $0.2 million we had received in 2015 for
reimbursed acquisition costs related to Riverglen. This contribution increased our equity-method investment by approximately $0.3
million. 

On September 2, 2016, the SUL JV acquired
two additional properties located in Delaware which increased our equity-method investment by approximately $1.8 million. 

Under the SUL LLC Agreement, as amended,
net operating cash flow of the SUL JV will be distributed monthly, first to the Operating Partnership and Best Years  pari passu 
up to a 9% to 10% annual return, as defined, and thereafter to Best Years 75% and the Operating Partnership 25%. All capital proceeds
from the sale of the properties held by the SUL JV, a refinancing, or another capital event will be paid first to the Operating
Partnership and Best Years  pari passu  until each has received an amount equal to its accrued but unpaid 9% to 10% return
plus its total contribution, and thereafter to Best Years 75% and the Operating Partnership 25%. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the Operating Partnership has recorded distributions receivable from the SUL JV of approximately $298,000 and $179,000, respectively.
This is included in tenant and other receivables on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. For the nine months ended September
30, 2016, we received approximately $340,000 in cash distributions, of which $167,000 is included in our cash flows from operating
activities in tenant and other receivables and $173,000 is included in our cash flows from investing activities. 

We serve as the manager of the SUL JV and
provide management services in exchange for fees and reimbursements (see Note 7). Total acquisition and asset management fees earned
in connection with the SUL JV were approximately $0.2 million and $25,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, and are included in acquisition and asset management fees in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
Total acquisition and asset management fees earned in connection with the SUL JV were approximately $0.3 million and $0.4 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are included in acquisition and asset management fees
in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the balance of our equity-method investment was approximately $4.0 million and $2.2 million, respectively. 

6. Receivables  

Notes Receivable  

Fernhill Note   

In September 2014, we loaned approximately
$140,000 to the operator of the Fernhill facility for certain property improvements at a fixed rate of interest of 6% payable in
monthly installments through January 2019. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the balance on the note was approximately
$0.1 million. 

Nantucket Note - Sale of VIE   

On January 7, 2015, through our Operating
Partnership, we sold Sherburne Commons to The Residences at Sherburne Commons, Inc. ( Sherburne Buyer ), an unaffiliated
Massachusetts non-profit corporation, in exchange for $5.0 million, as evidenced by a purchase money note from Sherburne Buyer
to us as the lender. During January 2015, we recorded a loss on disposition of approximately $1.7 million related to this previously
consolidated VIE, which is included in loss on discontinued operations on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

The $5.0 million purchase money note is
collateralized by the Sherburne Commons property, bears an annual interest rate of 3.5% and matures on December 31, 2017. Interest
payments on the note are due monthly and are recorded as payments are received. Outstanding and unpaid principal due shall be paid
from the net proceeds payable to Sherburne Buyer from the sale of the residential cottages in Sherburne Commons. We may also participate
in additional interest of up to $1 million from 50% of the net proceeds of cottage sales through December 31, 2018. 

As of September 30, 2016, we have not collected
any funds related to the principal on the note and the balance on the note receivable was $4.7 million. For the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, we received interest payments from the note of approximately $43,000 and $0, which is recorded as
interest income from notes receivable in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, we received interest payments from the note of approximately $115,000 and $0, which is recorded as interest
income from notes receivable in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.

7. Related Party Transactions   

CRA   

Prior to the termination of our advisory
agreement on April 1, 2014 with CRA (our former advisor, a related party), we incurred costs related to fees paid and costs reimbursed
for services rendered to us by CRA through March 31, 2014. Some of the fees we had paid to CRA were considered to be in excess
of allowed amounts and, therefore, CRA was required to reimburse us for the amount of the excess costs we paid to them. The fees
and expense reimbursements payable to CRA under our advisory agreement are described in more detail in our Annual Report filed
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 18, 2016.  As of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, the receivables from CRA are fully reserved due to the uncertainty of collectability and are included in tenant and other
receivables in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, we had the following receivables and reserves: 

SUL JV   

See Note 5 for further discussion of distributions
and acquisition and asset management fees related to the SUL JV.    

8. Concentration of Risk  

Our cash is generally invested in investment-grade
short-term instruments. As of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalent accounts in excess of FDIC-insured limits. However,
we do not believe the risk associated with this excess is significant.  

As of September 30, 2016, we owned one
property in California, four properties in Oregon, four properties in North Carolina, one property in Texas, and one property in
Illinois. Accordingly, there is a geographic concentration of risk subject to economic conditions in certain states. 

Additionally, for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, we leased our 11 healthcare properties to five different tenants under long-term triple net leases, two of
which comprise 51% and 30% percent of our tenant rental revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, we leased our 11
healthcare properties to five different tenants under long-term triple net leases, two of which comprise 49% and 29% of our tenant
rental revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we leased our 11 healthcare properties to five different tenants
under long-term triple net leases, two of which comprise 48% and 28% percent of our tenant rental revenue. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, we leased our 11 healthcare properties to five different tenants under long-term triple net leases, two
of which comprise 49% and 29% of our tenant rental revenue. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, we have one tenant that constitutes a significant asset concentration, as the net assets of the tenant exceeds 20% of our
total assets. 

9. Fair Value Measurements of Financial
Instruments  

Our condensed consolidated balance sheets
include the following financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, notes receivable (except as noted below),
deferred costs and deposits, tenant and other receivables, deferred leasing commissions, certain other assets, accounts payable
and accrued liabilities, accrued salaries and benefits, security deposits and loans payable. With the exception of the Nantucket
note receivable (see Note 6) and loans payable discussed below, we consider the carrying values to approximate fair value for such
financial instruments because of the short period of time between origination of the instruments and their expected payment. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the fair value of the Nantucket note receivable (see Note 6) was $4.9 million compared to the carrying value of $4.7 million.
The fair value of the note receivable was estimated based on cash flow analysis at an assumed market rate of interest. As the inputs
to our valuation estimate are neither observable in nor supported by market activity, our notes receivable are classified as Level
3 assets within the fair value hierarchy. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the fair value of loans payable was $61.4 million and $67.3 million compared to the carrying value of $60.5 million
and $65.9 million, respectively. The fair value of loans payable is estimated using lending rates available to us for financial
instruments with similar terms and maturities. To estimate fair value as of September 30, 2016, we utilized a discount rate ranging
from 4.4% to 7.3% and a weighted-average discount rate of 4.7%. As the inputs to our valuation estimate are neither observable
in nor supported by market activity, our loans payable are classified as Level 3 assets within the fair value hierarchy. 

As a result of our ongoing analysis for
potential impairment of our investments in real estate, we may be required to adjust the carrying value of certain assets to their
estimated fair values, or estimated fair value less selling costs, under certain circumstances. No impairments were recorded during
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

At September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, we do not have any financial assets or financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis in our
condensed consolidated financial statements. 

10. Commitments and Contingencies  

We inspect our properties for the presence
of hazardous or toxic substances. While there can be no assurance that a material environmental liability does not exist, we are
not currently aware of any environmental liability with respect to the properties that would have a material effect on our consolidated
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, we are not aware of any environmental liability or any unasserted
claim or assessment with respect to an environmental liability that we believe would require additional disclosure or the recording
of a loss contingency. 

Our commitments and contingencies include
the usual obligations of real estate owners and licensed operators in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management,
these matters are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows. We are also subject to contingent losses resulting from litigation against the Company. 

On April 1, 2014, CRA and Cornerstone Ventures,
Inc. filed a complaint in the Superior Court of California for the County of Orange-Central Justice Center, Case No. 30-2014-00714004-CU-BT-CJC,
naming the Company, its directors and two of its officers as defendants, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and compensatory
and punitive damages. On April 17, 2014, Judge Nakamura denied in its entirety plaintiffs  ex parte application for a temporary
restraining order to show cause why a preliminary injunction against the defendants should not issue.  On May 19, 2014, the
Company filed a counter claim against plaintiffs and certain individuals affiliated with CRA and affiliated entities. The
Company continues to believe that all of plaintiffs  claims are without merit and will continue to vigorously defend itself.
Plaintiffs and defendants are conducting discovery. 

A bankruptcy petition was filed against
Healthcare Real Estate Partners, LLC ( HCRE ) by the investors in Healthcare Real Estate Fund, LLC or Healthcare Real
Estate Qualified Purchasers Fund, LLC. Following the dismissal of the involuntary bankruptcy petition filed against it, in the
United States Bankruptcy Court of the District of Delaware HCRE filed a motion for attorneys  fees and damages and a separate
complaint for violation of the automatic stay against the petitioning creditors and the Company. At a status hearing, the Bankruptcy
Court expressed concern about HCRE commencing this litigation and urged the parties to mediate the issues. A mediation has been
set for December 2016. The Company believes that all of HCRE s claims are without merit and will vigorously defend itself. 

Friendship Haven and Stonegate Management Agreement   

In October 2015, as part of the amended
Stonegate management agreement (see Note 3) the lease is cancellable by either party with written notice, as defined in the agreement.
However, if we terminated the agreement before October 6, 2016, we could have been obligated to pay a termination fee up to three
times the highest monthly management fee paid to Stonegate prior to the termination. As of October 6, 2016, we did not terminate
the agreement and therefore there is no longer any obligation. On October 31, 2016, we notified Stonegate of the termination of
our management agreement, which will be effective as of February 28, 2017, or earlier, if approved. 

Medford Purchase Option   

Our property, Farmington Square in Medford,
Oregon, which has a book value of approximately $7.3 million as of September 30, 2016, is subject to a purchase option that
became exercisable on September 14, 2014. The option provides the option holder with the right to purchase the property at increasing
exercise price intervals based on elapsed time, starting at $10.8 million through October 2016, then increasing to $11.0 million
from November 2016 through July 2017 and then to $11.3 million until the option expires on August 13, 2022. In September 2016,
the option holder provided notice to exercise its option. See Note 12 for further information. 

Purchase Agreement   

In November 2013, a limited liability company
entered into a build-to-suit purchase agreement whereby it agreed to purchase a 70-unit assisted living facility in Athens, Georgia
for approximately $12.4 million upon substantial completion of the facility. In the event the limited liability company did not
purchase the building as provided for in the purchase agreement, it would be required to lease the facility from the seller for
a ten-year term at an annual rent amount equal to 8% of the cost of the facility. Summit was obligated to guarantee the payments
associated with that lease, however, in June 2016, the building was purchased by an independent third-party, the guarantee was
terminated and Summit is no longer under any obligation to this purchase agreement. 

Indemnification and Employment Agreements   

The Company has entered into
indemnification agreements with certain officers and directors of the Company against all judgments, penalties, fines and
amounts paid in settlement and all expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with any proceeding.
Additionally, in September 2015, the Company entered into three-year employment agreements with its officers which include
customary terms relating to salary, bonus, position, duties and benefits (including eligibility for equity compensation), as
well as a cash payment following a change in control of the Company, as defined in such agreements. In September 2016, the
compensation committee approved the 2016 executive compensation plan. For additional information, see the Company s
Form 8-K filed on September 29, 2016. 

Management of the SUL JV and the Fantasia JV   

As the manager of the SUL JV and the Fantasia
JV, we are responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the SUL JV and the Fantasia JV and are, thus, subject to contingencies
that may arise in the normal course of the their operations. 

11. Dispositions  

In accordance with ASC 360,  Property,
Plant   Equipment , we report results of operations from real estate assets that meet the definition of a component
of an entity that have been sold, or meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale, as discontinued operations. 

On January 7, 2015, we sold the Sherburne
Commons property. We recorded approximately $1.7 million as a loss on disposition during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
See Note 6 for further information. 

Disposal of real estate   

In April 2015, we contributed the JV 2
Properties to the SUL JV (see Notes 3, 4 and 5). 

The transaction had the following effect
to reduce our consolidated assets and liabilities: 

We recorded a partial gain of approximately
$1.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2015 related to the disposition of the JV 2 Properties contributed to the SUL
JV. 

In December 2015, we contributed the Cottage
Properties to the SUL JV which were acquired by us in November 2015 (see Notes 3, 4 and 5). The aggregate net value of the Cottage
Properties that were contributed was approximately $5.4 million, which approximated the Operating Partnership s carrying
value on the date of contribution (total assets were approximately $19.5 million less liabilities of approximately $14.1 million,
which included approximately $13.5 million in loans payable).   

On April 29, 2016, we contributed Riverglen
to the SUL JV (see Note 3). This contribution resulted in the SUL JV owning Riverglen and, therefore, Riverglen is no longer consolidated
in our condensed consolidated financial statements as of April 29, 2016. The aggregate net value of Riverglen at the date of the
contribution was approximately $3.9 million, which approximated the Operating Partnership s carrying value on the date of
contribution (total assets were approximately $9.2 million less liabilities of approximately $5.3 million, which included approximately
$4.7 million in a HUD insured loan payable (see Note 4)). Concurrent with the contribution of Riverglen, Best Years contributed
cash to the SUL JV in the amount of approximately $3.4 million and the Operating Partnership received cash of approximately $3.4
million from the SUL JV, not including approximately $0.2 million we had received in 2015 for reimbursed acquisition costs related
to Riverglen. This contribution increased our equity-method investment by approximately $0.3 million. 

12. Subsequent Events  

Medford Purchase Option and Sale   

In September 2016, the option
holder for our Medford property (see Note 10) provided notice to purchase the property. As of September 30, 2016, Medford was
not considered as an asset held for sale as all of the criteria for such classification was not met. On October 31, 2016, we
closed the sale of the Medford property. The total sale price was $10.8 million, of which we received approximately $3.8
million in cash. The aggregate carrying value of Medford at the date of the sale was approximately $1.3 million, (total
assets were approximately $8.0 million less liabilities of approximately $6.7 million, which included approximately $6.7
million in a HUD insured loan payable). As a result of the sale, as of November 1, 2016, Medford will no longer be
consolidated in our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, in October 2016, we recorded an estimated gain of
approximately $2.6 million related to the sale. 

Summit Fantasia Holdings, LLC   

On September 27, 2016, through our Operating
Partnership, we entered into a limited liability company agreement (as such agreement may be amended from time to time, the  Fantasia
LLC Agreement ) with Fantasia Investment III LLC ( Fantasia ), an unrelated entity and a U.S.-based affiliate
of Fantasia Holdings Group Co., Limited (a Chinese corporation), and formed Summit Fantasia Holdings, LLC (the  Fantasia
JV ). The Fantasia JV is not consolidated in our condensed consolidated financial statements and will be accounted for under
the equity-method in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 

On October 31, 2016, through
the Fantasia JV, we acquired a 20% interest in two senior housing facilities, an AL/MC facility located in Citrus
Heights, California and an MC facility located in Corvallis, Oregon, for an aggregate purchase price of $23 million, which
was funded through capital contributions from the members of the Fantasia JV plus the proceeds from a collateralized loan.
The facilities consist of a total of 126 licensed beds, and will be operated by and leased to a third party operator. 

Under the Fantasia LLC Agreement, net operating
cash flow of the Fantasia JV will be distributed quarterly, first to the Operating Partnership and Fantasia  pari passu  until
each member has received an amount equal to its accrued, but unpaid 8% return, and thereafter 70% to Fantasia and 30% to the Operating
Partnership. All capital proceeds from the sale of the properties held by the Fantasia JV, a refinancing or another capital event,
will be paid first to the Operating Partnership and Fantasia  pari passu  until each has received an amount equal to its accrued
but unpaid 8% return plus its total capital contribution, and thereafter 70% to Fantasia and 30% to the Operating Partnership. 

We serve as the manager of the Fantasia
JV and provide management services in exchange for fees and reimbursements. Under the Fantasia LLC Agreement, as the manager, we
are paid an acquisition fee upon closing of an acquisition, as defined in the agreement, based on the purchase price paid for the
properties. Additionally, we are paid on a quarterly basis an annual asset management fee equal to 0.75% of the initial capital
contribution of the members. 

We expect that the acquisition, through
the Fantasia JV, of the two senior housing facilities in Citrus Heights, California and Corvallis, Oregon, will increase our equity-method
investment as of October 31, 2016, by approximately $1.3 million. 

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

The following  Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  should be read in conjunction with our unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report. This section contains forward-looking
statements, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results,
and the assumptions upon which those statements are based. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words
 believes,   project,   expects,   anticipates,   estimates,   intends, 
 strategy,   plan,   may,   will,   would,   will be, 
 will continue,   will likely result,  and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on
current expectations and assumptions that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ
materially from the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements that were true at the time made may ultimately prove
to be incorrect or false. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a
result of new information, future events or otherwise. All forward-looking statements should be read in light of the risks identified
in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on March 18, 2016. 

Overview  

As of September 30, 2016, our ownership
interests in senior housing facilities were as follows: 100% ownership of five properties, a 95% interest in a consolidated joint
venture that owns six properties, and a 10% interest in an unconsolidated equity-method investment that owns 17 properties. As
used in this report, the  Company,   we,   us  and  our  refer to Summit Healthcare
REIT, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, except where the context otherwise requires. 

Our revenues are comprised largely of rental
income, including rents reported on a straight-line basis over the initial term of each lease and fees earned for resident care
from Friendship Haven (see Note 3 to the accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). Our growth depends,
in part, on our ability to acquire new healthcare properties at attractive prices, increase rental income from leases by increasing
rental rates and by controlling our expenses. Our operations are impacted by property-specific, market-specific, general economic,
regulatory and other conditions. 

We believe that investing in senior housing
facilities is accretive to earnings and stockholder value. Senior housing facilities include independent living facilities ( IL ),
skilled-nursing facilities ( SNF ), assisted living facilities ( AL ), memory care ( MC ) and
continuing care retirement communities ( CCRC ). Each of these types of facilities caters to different segments of
the senior population. Our strategy includes purchasing SNF, AL, IL MC, and CCRC facilities. 

Joint Venture Portfolio Properties   

SUL JV   

As part of our strategy to joint venture
with institutional capital to grow the Company s senior housing portfolio, through our operating partnership ( Operating
Partnership ), in April 2015, we formed Summit Union Life Holdings, LLC ( SUL JV ) with Best Years, LLC ( Best
Years ), an unrelated entity and a U.S.-based affiliate of Union Life Insurance Co, Ltd. (a Chinese corporation) and contributed
six wholly-owned limited liability companies (collectively, the  JV 2 Properties ) to the SUL JV. In October 2015,
through the SUL JV, we acquired a 10% interest in four separate SNFs in Texas ( Creative Properties ) and Best Years
acquired a 90% interest. In December 2015, we contributed four wholly-owned limited liability companies, which we acquired
in November 2015, that each own a senior housing facility (collectively, the  Cottage Properties ) to the SUL JV. On
April 29, 2016, we contributed our limited liability company interest in Riverglen to the SUL JV. See Notes 3, 5 and 11 to the
accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. In September 2016, through the SUL JV, we acquired a 10% interest
in two separate SNFs in Delaware ( Delaware Properties ) and Best Years acquired a 90% interest. 

The following reconciles our 10% equity
investment in the SUL JV from inception through September 30, 2016: 

During the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded distributions of approximately $163,000 and $91,000, respectively, and received cash of approximately
$126,000 and $23,000, respectively, from the SUL JV. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded distributions
of approximately $458,000 and $151,000, respectively, from the SUL JV and received cash of approximately $340,000 and $23,000,
respectively, from the SUL JV. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we have a distribution receivable of approximately
$298,000 and $179,000, respectively, from the SUL JV. 

We serve as the manager of the SUL JV
and provide management services in exchange for fees and reimbursements. Under the SUL JV agreement, as the manager, we are
paid an acquisition fee, as defined in the SUL JV agreement, based on the original purchase price paid for the properties.
Additionally, we are paid an annual asset management fee equal to 0.25% of the original purchase price paid for the
properties. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded approximately $0.2 million and $25,000,
respectively, in acquisition and asset management fees. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded
approximately $0.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively, in acquisition and asset management fees. 

A summary of the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial data for the balance sheets and statements of income (operations commenced on May 1, 2015) for the unconsolidated SUL
JV, of which we own a 10% equity interest, is as follows: 

Fantasia JV   

On September 27, 2016, through our Operating
Partnership, we entered into a limited liability company agreement (as such agreement may be amended from time to time, the  Fantasia
LLC Agreement ) with Fantasia Investment III LLC ( Fantasia ), an unrelated entity and a U.S.-based affiliate
of Fantasia Holdings Group Co., Limited (a Chinese corporation), and formed Summit Fantasia Holdings, LLC ( Fantasia JV ).
Fantasia JV is not consolidated in our condensed consolidated financial statements and will be accounted for under the equity-method
in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 

On October 31, 2016, through the Fantasia
JV, we acquired a 20% interest in two senior housing facilities, an AL/MC facility located in Citrus Heights, California and an
MC facility located in Corvallis, Oregon, for a total purchase price of $23 million. The facilities consist of a total of 126 licensed
beds, and will be operated by and leased to a third party operator. 

Under the Fantasia LLC Agreement, net operating
cash flow of the Fantasia JV will be distributed quarterly, first to the Operating Partnership and Fantasia  pari passu  until
each member has received an amount equal to its accrued, but unpaid 8% return, and thereafter 70% to Fantasia and 30% to the Operating
Partnership. All capital proceeds from the sale of the properties held by the Fantasia JV, a refinancing or another capital event,
will be paid first to the Operating Partnership and Fantasia  pari passu  until each has received an amount equal to its accrued
but unpaid 8% return plus its total capital contribution, and thereafter 70% to Fantasia and 30% to the Operating Partnership. 

We serve as the manager of the Fantasia
JV and provide management services in exchange for fees and reimbursements. Under the Fantasia LLC Agreement, as the manager, we
are paid an acquisition fee upon closing of an acquisition, as defined in the agreement, based on the purchase price paid for the
properties. Additionally, we are paid on a quarterly basis, an annual asset management fee equal to 0.75% of the initial capital
contribution of the members. 

We expect that the acquisition, through
the Fantasia JV, of the two senior housing facilities in Citrus Heights, California and Corvallis, Oregon, will increase our equity-method
investment as of October 31, 2016, by approximately $1.3 million. 

Summit Portfolio Properties   

At September 30, 2016, our portfolio consisted
of 11 properties, five of which are 100% owned by us and six of which are owned by us through our 95% interest in Cornerstone Healthcare
Partners LLC. All of the properties are 100% leased on a triple net basis. The following table (excluding the 17 properties held
by the SUL JV, our unconsolidated 10% equity-method investment) provides summary information regarding these properties as of September
30, 2016: 

1  Represents year-to-date through
September 30, 2016 revenue based on in-place leases, including straight-line rent. 

2  Rent due under a lease between
the Company and a wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary ( Friendswood TRS ) was approximately $1.2 million year-to-date
through September 30, 2016. Such rental income is eliminated in consolidation. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

There have been no material changes to
our critical accounting policies as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015 as filed with the SEC on March 18, 2016, except as noted under Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements in Note 2 to the
accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Results of Operations  

Our results of operations are described
below: 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three
Months Ended September 30, 2015   

(1)  
      Net operating income ( NOI ) is a non-GAAP supplemental measure used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate properties. We define NOI as rental revenues, tenant reimbursements and other income, resident services and fee income, less property operating and resident services costs. NOI excludes acquisition and asset management fees, interest income from notes receivable, general and administrative expense, depreciation and amortization, income from equity-method investee, other income, interest expense, and loss from discontinued operations. We believe NOI provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the operating performance of the REIT s real estate at the property level on an unleveraged basis. We use NOI to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess and compare property-level performance. We believe that net income (loss) is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to NOI. NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income (loss) as defined by GAAP since it does not reflect the aforementioned excluded items. Additionally, NOI as we define it may not be comparable to NOI as defined by other REITs or companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating NOI.   

Total rental revenue for our properties
includes rental revenues and tenant paid and/or reimbursements for property taxes and insurance. Property operating expenses include
insurance, property taxes and other operating expenses, including management fees. Resident service and fee income and resident
services costs are generated from Friendswood TRS. Net operating income decreased by approximately $0.2 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 mainly due to the decrease in resident services and fee income with a corresponding decrease in resident
services costs as a result of decreased occupancy at the facility. 

The increase in the acquisition and asset
management fees of approximately $0.2 million is due to the $135,000 in acquisition fees earned on the SUL JV properties acquired
by the SUL JV in September 2016 and an increase in asset management fees due to the SUL JV owning 17 properties as of September
2016 and owning six properties as of September 2015. 

The net increase in general and administrative
expenses is mainly due to approximately $0.3 million in legal expenses associated with the CRA litigation and $0.3 million in
executive bonuses paid out for the September 2016 SUL JV acquisition offset by a decrease in other professional and board fees. 

The increase in interest income from notes
receivable increased due to the collection of interest income on the Nantucket Note (see Note 6 to the accompanying Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements). 

The loss from discontinued operations
was a result of the sale of Sherburne Commons on January 7, 2015 (see Note 11 to the accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements). 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2015   

(1)  
      Net operating income ( NOI ) is a non-GAAP supplemental measure used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate properties. We define NOI as rental revenues, tenant reimbursements and other income, and resident services and fee income, less property operating costs and resident services costs. NOI excludes acquisition and asset management fees, interest income from notes receivable, general and administrative expense, depreciation and amortization, income from equity-method investee, other income, interest expense, gain on disposition of real estate properties, and loss from discontinued operations. We believe NOI provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the operating performance of the REIT s real estate at the property level on an unleveraged basis. We use NOI to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess and compare property-level performance. We believe that net income (loss) is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to NOI. NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income (loss) as defined by GAAP since it does not reflect the aforementioned excluded items. Additionally, NOI as we define it may not be comparable to NOI as defined by other REITs or companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating NOI.   

Total rental revenue for our properties
includes rental revenues and tenant reimbursements for property taxes and insurance. Property operating expenses include insurance,
property taxes and other operating expenses, including management fees. Resident services and fee income and resident services
costs are generated from Friendswood TRS. Net operating income decreased by approximately $1.5 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. Of that amount, $1.4 million is due to the contribution of the JV 2 properties to the SUL JV in April 2015
as we recorded four months of rental revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and none for the nine months ended September
30, 2016. Additionally, $0.5 million of the decrease in net operating income is due to the decrease in resident service and fee
income with a corresponding decrease in resident services costs as a result of decreased occupancy at the facility. 

The decrease in the acquisition and asset
management fees of approximately $0.1 million is due to the acquisition fees earned on the JV2 properties acquired by the SUL
JV in April 2015 of $0.4 million for the JV 2 properties vs. $156,000 for SUL JV acquisitions in 2016, offset by the increase
in asset management fees due to the SUL JV owning 17 properties as of September 2016 and owning 6 properties as of September 2015. 

The increase in interest income from notes
receivable increased due to collection of interest income on the Nantucket Note (see Note 6 to the accompanying Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements). 

The net increase in general and administrative
expenses is due to $0.4 million in legal expenses associated with the CRA litigation and $0.1 million in write off of acquisition
costs offset by a decrease in other professional and board fees. 

Depreciation and amortization decreased
by approximately $0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 mainly due to the contribution of the JV 2 properties
to the SUL JV in April 2015. 

Interest expense decreased by approximately
$0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 mainly due to the contribution of the JV 2 properties to the SUL JV
in April 2015. 

In April 2015, as a result of the disposition
of the JV 2 Properties contributed to the SUL JV, we recorded a partial gain on disposition of approximately $1.0 million related
to the disposition of these properties (see Note 11 to the accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). 

The loss from discontinued operations was
a result of the sale of Sherburne Commons on January 7, 2015 (see Note 11 to the accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements). 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

As of September 30, 2016, we had approximately
$7.3 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand. Based on current conditions, we believe that we have sufficient capital resources
for the next twelve months. 

Going forward, we expect our primary sources
of cash to be rental revenues, tenant reimbursements, joint venture equity and distributions, and refinancing of existing debt.
In addition, we may increase cash through the sale of additional properties, which may result in the deconsolidation of properties
we already own, or borrowing against currently-owned properties. For the foreseeable future, we expect our primary uses of cash
to be for the repayment of principal on loans payable, funding future acquisitions, operating expenses, and interest expense on
outstanding indebtedness. We may also incur expenditures for renovations of our existing properties, such as increasing the size
of the properties by developing additional rentable square feet and/or making the space more appealing. 

We continue to pursue options for
repaying and/or refinancing debt obligations with long-term, fixed rate HUD insured loans. In October and December 2015, we
successfully refinanced two of our existing loan arrangements with Lancaster Pollard (HUD insured) loans (see Note 4 to the
accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). We believe that market conditions may be acceptable to
continue to raise capital through additional joint venture arrangements with either our existing joint venture partners or
new partners, although there can be no assurances that any such transactions will have terms acceptable to us or will be
consummated. 

Our liquidity will increase if cash from
operations exceeds expenses, we receive net proceeds from the sale of whole or partial interest in a property or properties or
refinancing results in excess loan proceeds. Our liquidity will decrease as proceeds are expended in connection with the acquisitions
and operation of properties. Our ability to repay or refinance debt could be adversely affected by an inability to secure financing
at reasonable terms, if at all. 

Credit Facilities and Loan Agreements   

As of September 30, 2016, we had debt obligations
of approximately $60.5 million. The outstanding balance by loan agreement is as follows: 

Healthcare Financial Solutions,
LLC (formerly GE Capital) approximately $2.8 million maturing October 2018  

Distributions   

We made no stockholder distributions during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Funds from Operations ( FFO )  

FFO is a non-GAAP supplemental financial
measure that is widely recognized as a measure of REIT operating performance. We compute FFO in accordance with the definition
outlined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ). NAREIT defines FFO as net income
(loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property, plus depreciation and amortization
and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. 

Our FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported
by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT
definition differently than we do. We believe that FFO is helpful to investors and our management as a measure of operating performance
because it excludes depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions, impairments and extraordinary items,
and as a result, when compared period to period, reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates,
operating costs, development activities, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which is not immediately apparent
from net income. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of
real estate diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions,
many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical
cost accounting alone to be insufficient. As a result, our management believes that the use of FFO, together with the required
GAAP presentations, provide a more complete understanding of our performance. Factors that impact FFO include start-up costs, fixed
costs, delays in buying assets, lower yields on cash held in accounts pending investment, income from portfolio properties and
other portfolio assets, interest rates on acquisition financing and operating expenses. FFO should not be considered as an alternative
to net income (loss), as an indication of our performance, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including
our ability to make distributions. 

Our FFO has been positive over the past
year primarily due to increased rental revenue from our acquisitions, and reduced expenses. FFO for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 were $0.4 million and $1.5 million, respectively. The decrease in 2016 was primarily due to the contribution
of the six JV 2 properties to the SUL JV in April 2015. We owned 10% of the six JV 2 properties for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 as opposed to 100% of the six JV 2 properties for four months in 2015. We also experienced an increase in legal fees of
approximately $0.5 million in 2016 associated with the CRA litigation and HCRE litigation. 

The following is the reconciliation from
net loss applicable to common stockholders, the most direct comparable financial measure calculated and presented with GAAP, to
FFO for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Subsequent Events  

See Note 12 to the accompanying Notes to
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
Market Risk   

Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ))
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our senior management, including our President (Principal Executive Officer) and
our Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management
recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship
of possible controls and procedures. Our President (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial
Officer) evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures
were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 

There have been no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings  

On April 1, 2014, CRA and Cornerstone Ventures,
Inc. filed a complaint in the Superior Court of California for the County of Orange-Central Justice Center, Case No. 30-2014-00714004-CU-BT-CJC,
naming the Company, its directors and two of its officers as defendants, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and compensatory
and punitive damages. On April 17, 2014, Judge Nakamura denied in its entirety plaintiffs  ex parte application for a temporary
restraining order to show cause why a preliminary injunction against the defendants should not issue.  On May 19, 2014, the
Company filed a counter claim against plaintiffs and certain individuals affiliated with CRA and affiliated entities. The
Company continues to believe that all of plaintiffs  claims are without merit and will continue to vigorously defend itself. 
Plaintiffs and defendants are conducting discovery. 

A bankruptcy petition was filed against
HCRE by the investors in Healthcare Real Estate Fund, LLC or Healthcare Real Estate Qualified Purchasers Fund, LLC. Following the
dismissal of the involuntary bankruptcy petition filed against it, in the United States Bankruptcy Court of the District of Delaware
HCRE filed a motion for attorneys  fees and damages and a separate complaint for violation of the automatic stay against
the petitioning creditors and the Company. At a status hearing, the Bankruptcy Court expressed concern about HCRE commencing this
litigation and urged the parties to mediate the issues. A mediation has been set for December 2016. The Company believes that all
of HCRE s claims are without merit and will vigorously defend itself.
