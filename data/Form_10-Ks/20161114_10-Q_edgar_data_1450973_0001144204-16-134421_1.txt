  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  (UNAUDITED)  

Note 1    ORGANIZATION   

EFT Holdings, Inc.,  EFT Holdings  or the  Company, 
formerly EFT Biotech Holdings, Inc., was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 19, 1992.  The Company s business
is classified by management into two reportable segments: online and beverage. These reportable segments are two distinct businesses,
each with a different customer base, marketing strategy and management structure. Substantially all of the Company s revenue
is generated from Mainland China. 

Note 2    GOING CONCERN   

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has negative working capital of $11,910,907 and
an accumulated deficit of $54,155,174 as of September 30, 2016, and it reported net operating losses for the past two fiscal years.
The Company expects to continue incurring losses for the foreseeable future and may need to raise additional capital from external
sources in order to continue the long-term efforts contemplated under its business plan. These circumstances, among others, raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

The Company expects to continue incurring losses for the foreseeable
future and may need to raise additional capital from external sources in order to continue the long-term efforts contemplated under
its business plan. The Company is in the process of reevaluating its current marketing strategy as it relates to the sale of its
current product line. In addition, the Company is pursuing other revenue streams which could include strategic acquisitions or
possible joint ventures of other business segments. 

Note 3    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Basis of presentation  

The unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the opinion of management, the unaudited financial statements have been
prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring
adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position as of September 30, 2016 and the results of operations and cash
flows for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The financial data and other information disclosed in these notes to the
interim financial statements related to these periods are unaudited. The results for the three and six months ended September 30,
2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent periods or for the year ending March 31, 2017.
The balance sheet at March 31, 2016 has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date. 

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included
in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed
or omitted pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and regulations. These unaudited financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended March
31, 2016 as included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016. 

Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to current
year presentation. 

Principles of consolidation  

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned except for Digital Development Partners Inc.,  Digital ,
which is 91.7% owned by the Company. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. 

Uses of estimates in the preparation of financial statements  

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
These estimates and assumptions include determining the fair market value of the Company s inventory, the collectability
of accounts receivable, the value of deferred taxes and related valuation allowances. Certain of the Company s estimates,
including evaluating the collectability of accounts receivable and the fair market value of inventory, could be affected by external
conditions, including those particular to the Company s industry, and general economic conditions. It is possible that these
external factors could have an effect on the Company s estimates that could cause actual results to differ from the Company s
estimates. The Company re-evaluates all of its accounting estimates at least quarterly based on these conditions and records adjustments
when necessary. 

Fair value measurements   

ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. This topic does not require any new fair
value measurements. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer
a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value is a market-based
measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability.
As a basis for considering such assumptions, ASC Topic 820 establishes a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs
used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value: 

Level 1     
      Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.   

Level 2     
      Other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.   

Level 3     
      Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.   

The fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize
the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. In accordance with ASC Topic
820, the Company measures its securities available for sale at fair value. The securities available for sale are classified within
Level 1 since they are valued using quoted market prices. 

Revenue / Unearned Revenue  

The Company s revenue recognition
policy is in accordance with the requirements of Staff Accounting Bulletin,  SAB,  No. 104, Revenue Recognition,  SAB
104,  ASC Topic 605, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer, Including a Reseller of the Vendor s
Products, and other applicable revenue recognition guidance and interpretations.  Sales revenue is recognized when a formal
arrangement exists with the customers, the price is fixed or determinable, the delivery is completed, no other significant obligations
of the Company exist and collectability is reasonably assured.  Payments received before all relevant criteria for revenue
recognition are satisfied are recorded as unearned revenue, which is recorded as a liability until the products are delivered.
Sales are recorded when the products are received by Affiliates and risk of ownership has passed. 

The Company pays commissions to the Affiliates
based upon, among other things, their purchases from the Company and purchases by other Affiliates who were recommended to the
Company. Commissions paid to the Company s Affiliates are considered to be a reduction of the selling prices of its products,
and are recorded as a reduction of revenue.  The Company s policy is to pay out commission to Affiliates upon receipt
of sales orders even before revenue can be recognized. 

Recent accounting pronouncements  

There are no new accounting pronouncements adopted or enacted
during the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on the Company s
financial statements. 

Note 4    SECURITIES AVAILABLE
FOR SALE   

Securities available for sale consist of the following:  

(1)   
       Average remaining duration to maturity, in years.    

All securities were classified as available
for sale as of each date presented. 

The following table shows the gross unrealized losses and fair
value of the Company s investments, aggregated by investment category and length of time that the individual securities have
been in a continuous unrealized loss position, as of September 30, 2016: 

Declines in the fair value of available for sale securities
below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses to the extent the impairment
is related to credit losses. The amount of the impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income.
In estimating other-than-temporary impairment losses, management considers, among other things: (i) the length of time and the
extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and
(iii) the intent and ability to retain the investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated
recovery of cost. 

There were 5 securities in an unrealized loss position at September
30, 2016. Management does not intend to sell any of the securities classified as available for sale which have unrealized losses
and believes that it is not likely that the Company will have to sell any such securities before a recovery of cost. The unrealized
losses are largely due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were
purchased and are not the result of deteriorated credit quality. The fair value is expected to recover as the bonds approach their
maturity or re-pricing date or if market yields for such investments decline. Management does not believe such securities are other-than-temporarily
impaired due to reasons of credit quality. 

Investment securities with a book value
of $80,769 were sold during the six months ended September 30, 2016. The Company recognized a gain of $1,302 on the sale of those
securities. 

Note 5    INVENTORIES   

The components of inventories were as follows: 

Note 6    LOANS TO RELATED PARTIES
AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS    

The Company uses the  EFT  name, a trademark owned
and licensed to it by EFT Assets Limited ( EFT Assets ), a company that Wendy Qin, a director of EFT International
Ltd., served as a director until March 2015. The Company is required to pay an annual royalty to EFT Assets equal to a percentage
of its gross sales for the previous fiscal year. The percentage is 5% for the first $30 million in gross sales, 4% for the $10
million in gross sales in excess of $30 million, 3% for the $10 million in gross sales in excess of $40 million; 2% for the $10
million in gross sales in excess of $50 million; and 1% for the $10 million in gross sales in excess of $60 million, with a minimum
annual royalty of $500,000. EFT Assets is owned by a number of persons, including Wendy Qin. Ms. Qin is the sister of Jack Jie
Qin, the Company s president. During each of the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company accrued $250,000
of royalties payable to EFT Assets. 

In March 2010, the Company s subsidiary,
EFT International Ltd., entered into a consulting agreement with JFL Capital Limited ( JFL ), a company of which Wendy
Qin serves as a director and is one of the principal shareholders. Under this agreement,  JFL will provide consulting services
on administration, financial matters, corporate planning and business development commencing on April 1, 2010, with an annual fee
of $315,000. The annual fee is increased at the rate of $15,000 each year starting from April 1, 2011. The agreement may be terminated
by either party on three months  written notice. For the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company accrued
consulting fees payable to JFL of $202,500 and $195,000, respectively. 

From April 1, 2014 to April 1, 2015, the
Company rented 2,500 square feet of office space with a monthly rent of $10,735 for its satellite training center located at Suite

The former office location is owned by a number of persons, including Wendy Qin, a director of EFT (HK) Ltd and the sister of Jack
Jie Qin, the Company s president.  During the six months ended September 30, 2015, the Company paid the lessors $42,983.
The lease was terminated on June 24, 2015. 

In February 2016, the Company advanced $1,000,000 to President
Jack Qin for the prepayment of amounts relating to business development activities planned by the Company. The advance was not
used and was repaid to the Company in June 2016. 

Note 7    OTHER CURRENT
LIABILITIES   

Accrued and other current liabilities consist
of the following: 

Note 8    CONTINGENT
LIABILITIES   

In 2009, the Company s
subsidiary, Tianquan, engaged a general contractor to construct a water manufacturing plant for RMB4,758,600 ($766,000). Upon
completion, EFT inspected the plant and found several material construction defects, including, but not limited to, the fact
that the contractor used inferior construction material, inconsistent construction plans and substandard insulation material.
As a result, EFT conditioned its final construction payment to the contractor in the amount of RMB698,896 ($112,500) on the
rectification of all construction defects. On March 22, 2012, the contractor brought a case against EFT in Baiquan
People s Court in Heilongjiang Province seeking approximately RMB1,912,000 ($308,000) of purported outstanding payments
under the contract and interest thereon. On January 16, 2014, Tianquan received an unfavorable decision issued by Baiquan
People s Court in Heilongjiang Province awarding the contractor approximately RMB1,326,916 ($199,536) of purported
outstanding payments under the contract and interest thereon. The Company filed an appeal with Qiqihar Intermediate
People s Court and recorded contingent liabilities of RMB1,326,916 ($199,536). On January 5, 2016, the Company s
subsidiary, Tianquan, received an unfavorable decision issued by Baiquan People s Court awarding the contractor
approximately RMB827,000 ($123,988) of purported outstanding payments under the contract and interest thereon. The Company
filed an appeal of the decision. On July 18, 2016, Baiquan People s Court dismissed the appeal. The Company revised the
contigent liabilities to RMB827,000 ($123,988). (See Note 12) 

Note 9    SHORT-TERM LOAN   

The Company received a $503,200 loan from a third party, Insurance
Financing, Inc.,  IFI , to finance the directors  and officers  insurance premium for the fiscal years
2014 and 2015. The loan bore an interest rate of 3.60% per annum, and was to be repaid over a nine-month period which began on
December 15, 2014. The terms of the agreement allowed for the Company to make nine equal payments of $56,753 each and the loan
was fully repaid during the quarter ended September 30, 2015. 

The Company renewed coverage for the 2015-2016 periods and received
a new loan in the amount of $462,170 from IFI to finance the directors  and officers  insurance premium bearing an
interest rate of 3.60% per annum. The loan was to be repaid over a nine-month period beginning on December 15, 2015. The terms
of the agreement allowed for the Company to make nine equal payments of $52,126 each and the loan was fully repaid during the quarter
ended September 30, 2016. 

Note 10    INCOME TAXES   

The Company was incorporated in the United States and has operations
in five tax jurisdictions - the United States, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,  HK SAR , mainland China,
Taiwan, and the BVI. 

The Company s BVI operations are not subject to any taxes
according to BVI tax law. The Company s HK SAR subsidiaries are subject to a 16.5% profit tax based on its taxable net profit.
EFT (HK) Ltd provides management service to a BVI subsidiary, and the BVI subsidiary reimburses EFT (HK) Ltd for its total operating
expenses plus a 5% mark up, and the income is subject to a 16.5% profit tax. The Company s U.S. operations are subject to
income tax according to U.S. tax law. 

The Company s Taiwan subsidiary, EFTI, and its factory
in mainland China are subject to a 17% and 25% standard enterprise income tax, respectively, based on its taxable net profit. These
operations have incurred net accumulated operating losses for income tax purposes and management believes that it is more likely
than not that these net accumulated operating losses will not be utilized in the future. Therefore, it has provided full valuation
allowance for the deferred tax assets arising from the losses as of September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

The income tax expense consists of the following: 

A reconciliation of income taxes, with the amounts computed
by applying the statutory federal income tax rate, 37% for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, to income before income
taxes for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, is as follows: 

The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in
the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various states and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject
to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S., income tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years before the year ended March
31, 2007. 

The Company has not provided deferred taxes on unremitted earnings
attributable to international companies that have been considered to be reinvested indefinitely. Because of the availability of
U.S. foreign tax credits, it is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were
not indefinitely reinvested. In accordance with ASC Topic 740, interest associated with unrecognized tax benefits is classified
as income tax and penalties are classified in selling, general and administrative expenses in the statements of operations. 

The extent of the Company s operations involves dealing
with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes
paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of
disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax
liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether,
and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. 

Note 11    SEGMENT INFORMATION   

The Company s business is classified by management into
two reportable business segments: online and beverage. The online business reportable segment is an aggregation of the Company s
online operating segments, which are organized to sell the Company s products to Affiliates through its websites. The online
business reportable segment derives revenue from the sales of nutritional products, personal care products and EFT-phones and access
fees for its network platform. The beverage business reportable segment derives revenue and expense from the bottled water factory
in Baiquan, Heilongjiang Province, the PRC. Unallocated items comprise mainly corporate expenses and corporate assets. 

Although substantially all of the Company s revenue is
generated from Mainland China, the Company is organizationally structured along business segments. The accounting policies of each
of the Company s operating segments are the same as those described in Note 3,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.  

The following tables provide the business segment information
as of and for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Income tax allocations have been determined based on
statutory rates in the applicable business segment. 

Note 12    LITIGATION   

On August 2, 2010, the Company commenced a legal proceeding
against Marinteknik Shipbuilders (S) Pte Ltd. and six other persons in the High Court of the Republic of Singapore alleging fraud,
misrepresentation, and deceit on the part of the defendants with respect to the Company s investment in Excalibur. The Company
claims that the wrongful actions of the defendants resulted in damages of $19,000,000 to the Company. On December 11, 2012, the
High Court issued a decision whereby it dismissed the Company s actions against Marinteknik and Lim Lan Eng (Priscilla),
a director of Marinteknik. On January 8, 2013, the Company filed an appeal against the decision made by the High Court. On November
29, 2013, the appellate court issued its order and sustained the High Court s decision and awarded legal fees to the defendants.
The Company has accrued a liability in the amount of $200,000 for the legal costs. The High Court dismissed the appeal by the Company,
but criticized the defendants, stating that their actions were  wholly lacking in probity  and  likely also to
have been unlawful . After seeking further legal advice and balancing all factors, however, it was decided that commencing
further legal proceedings on this matter is not beneficial to the commercial interests of the Company. On October 15, 2015, the
High Court determined that the Company is obligated to bear the defendants  legal costs of approximately SGD 307,000. On
February 18, 2016, the Commercial Affairs Department issued a letter to confirm completion of the investigation of the report by
the Company regarding Lim Lam Eng (Priscilla) and Marinteknik Shipbuilders (S) Pte Ltd. and confirmed their view that no evidence
of a criminal offense was disclosed and they will not be pursuing the matter further. 

On March 4, 2016, the Company received a letter from
its solicitor RHT requesting legal fees in the amount of approximately SGD 85,000. The Company refused to pay
the solicitor s legal fees because the Company believed that it was inadequately represented by the solicitor. On June
19, 2016, the solicitor filed a claim with the High Court of Singapore for the legal fees in the amount of
approximately SGD85,000. On October 31, 2016, the High Court issued a judgment in favor of the solicitor for that amount
plus interest and costs. 

On June 9, 2016, Lim Lan Eng Priscilla and Marinteknik filed
an action against EFTI in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York. The action sought summary judgment on
their claims for fees in the sum of $162,720.38, arising out of the Singapore High Court s determination that plaintiffs
were entitled to an award of their fees and costs in connection with the Singapore litigation. After consulting with counsel, EFTI
declined to contest the summary judgment and judgment was entered in the Supreme Court for the sum of $162,720.38 in favor of the
plaintiffs. 

In 2009, the Company s subsidiary, Heilongjiang Tianquan
Manor Soda Drinks Co. Ltd.,  Tianquan , engaged a general contractor, the  Contractor , to construct a
water manufacturing plant, the  Plant , for RMB 4,758,600 ($776,300). Upon completion, the Company inspected the Plant
and found several material construction defects, including, but not limited to, the fact that the Contractor used inferior construction
material, inconsistent construction plans and substandard insulation material. As a result, in 2010, the Company conditioned its
final construction payment to the Contractor in the amount of RMB 698,896 ($112,500) on the rectification of all construction
defects. On March 22, 2012, the Contractor brought a case against Tianquan in Baiquan People s Court in Heilongjiang Province
seeking approximately RMB 1,912,000 of purported outstanding payments under the contract and interest thereon. On January 16,
2014, the Company s subsidiary, Tianquan, received an unfavorable decision issued by Baiquan People s Court in Heilongjiang
Province awarding the contractor approximately RMB1,326,916 of purported outstanding payments under the contract and interest
thereon. Tianquan filed an appeal with the Qiqihar Intermediate People s Court on January 27, 2014. On August 18, 2014,
the Qiqihar Intermediate People s Court issued a judgment rescinding the unfavorable decision issued by the Baiquan People s
Court and ordered the case to be reheard at the Baiquan People s Court. On September 25, 2014, Tianquan received a favorable
decision from Baiquan People s Court as the court concluded that the company stamps affixed to all of the Contractor s
legal documents were fake. On November 5, 2014, the subcontractor brought another civil case against Tianquan in the Baiquan People s
Court in Heilongjiang Province seeking RMB 1,823,787 of purported outstanding payments under the same contract and interest thereon.
On December 8, 2014, Tianquan filed a civil lawsuit against the sub-contractor for compensation for material construction defects.
On December 31, 2015, the two cases were reheard at the Baiquan People s Court and the sub-contractor changed the claim
to the amount of RMB 1,123,266. On January 5, 2016, the Company s subsidiary, Tianquan, received an unfavorable decision
issued by Baiquan People s Court awarding the contractor approximately RMB 827,000 of purported outstanding payments under
the contract and interest thereon. The Court ordered the subcontractor to reimburse the amount of RMB 120,000 for testing fees
to the Company. The Company filed an appeal of the order awarding the contractor approximately RMB827,000 of purported outstanding
payments under the contract and accrued interest. On August 17, 2016, Baiquan People s Court dismissed the appeal of the
order awarding the contractor approximately RMB827,000 of purported outstanding payments under the contract and interest thereon. 

On January 30, 2015, a class action entitled Wang, et al. v.
EFT Holdings, Inc., et al. was filed on behalf of a putative class of all purchasers of the Company s products against the
Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Central District
of California. On April 29, 2015, the court consolidated this action with the Li, et al. v. Qin, et al. and Li, et al. v. EFT Holdings,
Inc., et al. actions. On May 7, 2015, Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, which was fully briefed by the parties.
On December 14, 2015, the court denied Plaintiffs  motion for class certification. On April 6, 2016, the parties stipulated
to a voluntary dismissal of Plaintiffs  claims with prejudice. 

On December 6, 2013, the Company named George Curry, a former
director and officer of the Company, as one of the defendants in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, with
reference to the CTX investment transaction, in which the Company alleges, among other things, that Mr. Curry breached his fiduciary
duty and committed fraud and misrepresentation in respect of the Company s investment in CTX. 

On April 18, 2014, George Curry filed a Notice of Removal for
the above action to be brought in the District Court of California, Los Angeles (Western District). In the same action, he brought
a counterclaim against the Company, Jack Qin and Pyng Soon and sought implied and equitable indemnity, declaratory relief and apportionment
of fault. On or around December 11, 2014, George Curry filed a motion for summary judgment against the Company and all other cross
defendants in the matter. The motion was heard on February 26, 2015 and the court denied George Curry s motion. Thereafter,
a second motion for summary judgment was filed by Mr. Curry. That motion was denied as well. The final resolution of the entire
matter is still pending. Trial is currently scheduled for February 7, 2017. In addition, the Court consolidated the trial of this
matter with that of the Company s lawsuit against CTX, Buckman, Buckman   Reid and Peter Lau. 

On March 4, 2015, the Company filed a civil lawsuit in the United
States District Court, Central District of California, against CTX, Buckman, Buckman   Reid, Cliff Rhee and Peter Lau alleging
breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, misrepresentation, concealment, negligent misrepresentation
and negligence. 

On April 14, 2015, Defendant CTX filed a motion to dismiss.
On May 28, 2015, the court granted CTX s motion, in part, with leave to amend. The Company filed a First Amended Complaint
on June 8, 2015, asserting causes of action for: (1) breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (2) breach of fiduciary
duty; (3) fraud-misrepresentation; and (4) fraud-concealment. On June 24, 2015, CTX filed an answer to the First Amended Complaint.
Buckman, Buckman   Reid and Peter Lau also filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint. The Court granted the motion with respect
to the breach of fiduciary duty claim, with leave to amend, but denied it as to all other claims. After the Company s filing
of its First Amended Complaint, Buckman, Buckman   Reid and Peter Lau filed an answer to the First Amended Complaint on July
9, 2015. 

On May 26, 2016, the Court struck CTX s Answer to the
Complaint and entered a default judgment. The Company thereafter submitted a default judgment package. On September 6, 2016, the
court, after reviewing the default judgment package, entered judgment against CTX, and in favor of the Company, in the amount of
$2,500,000. 

On April 1, 2016, Buckman, Buckman   Reid and Peter Lau
filed a motion with the court to compel the matter to arbitration, thereby seeking to avoid a jury trial. The Company opposed the
motion, arguing that there was no applicable arbitration provision, and seeking to retain the right to a jury trial. After extensive
briefings, and following oral argument, on June 2, 2016, the Court denied Buckman, Buckman   Reid and Peter Lau s motion
to compel arbitration. The Court thereafter scheduled the trial for February 7, 2017. The Company continues to engage in discovery
in preparation for the upcoming trial. 

On June 22, 2015, a complaint entitled Greenstone Holdings,
Inc. v. EFT Holdings, Inc., et al. was filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, asserting
a claim for express indemnity against the Company, in excess of $150,000. After negotiations, the Company entered into a confidential
settlement with Greenstone Holdings, Inc. on April 14, 2016. 

Note 13    SUBSEQUENT EVENTS   

The Company has reviewed its subsequent events through the date
these consolidated financial statements were issued and has determined that no material subsequent events have occurred through
such date. 

ITEM
2.   
       Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.    

Products   

The Company sells 27 different nutritional products, some of
which are oral sprays; 21 different personal care products; an environmentally protective automotive product; an environmentally
friendly house cleaner; and a flip top portable drinking container that contains a filter to remove impurities from the water.
The Company s products are biodegradable and are not regulated by federal, state or local environmental laws or environmental
laws of its key target markets. 

The Company generally does not have a return policy but it does
provide a warranty for its products. The specific warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold, but generally
include replacement of defective products, but no refunds, during the six month period following a sale. Historically, the Company s
warranty expenses have not been material. 

Manufacturing  

The Company s products are manufactured by third-party
vendors and are packaged under its brand. The packaging for its products clearly states the country of manufacture, which is currently
the United States in most cases. The Company does not have any long-term supply contracts or agreements with any manufacturers.
The Company orders its products directly from vendors, on an  as-needed  or  expected need  basis. Raw
materials used in the manufacture of the Company s products are readily available and are not in short supply. The Company
is not a party to any agreement for the purchase or delivery of raw materials. 

From 2009 through 2012, the Company constructed a factory and
water plant to produce bottled natural soda water in Baiquan, Heilongjiang Province, China. The bottled water factory is fully
constructed and all manufacturing equipment has been purchased. After obtaining all the required licenses and passing ISO22000
requirements, the factory started production in April 2013, but production was suspended because Tianquan was sued by a contractor
who constructed the water plant. The production is expected to resume when the lawsuit is closed. 

None of the Company s vendors account for a significant
portion of its business and all of them can be replaced on short notice. The Company does not have any binding commitments or manufacturing
agreements with any of its vendors. 

Sales  

The Company sells its products primarily through its website
and only to  Affiliates.  To become an Affiliate, a customer must be referred by another Affiliate and make a minimum
purchase of $450 ($400 worth of products plus $50 for shipping and handling fees). After that point, the new Affiliate is not required
to make any additional purchases, pay membership fees, buy products, resell products, recruit others, or attend meetings. Free
educational classes are offered to the Company s Affiliates so they can learn more about the Company s products and
how to use them. 

As of November 1, 2016, the Company had received 1,259,111 orders
from its Affiliates, most of whom were located in China and Hong Kong. For the six months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
did not have any sales activities in the United States. None of the Company s Affiliates account for a significant portion
of its business. 

The Company pays its Affiliates a commission on products ordered
from the Company. The commission is approximately 58% of the total dollar amount of the order. Commissions are considered a reduction
of the sales price of the Company s products and are reflected in the Company s financial statements as a reduction
in revenue. The commissions earned by each Affiliate are held in book entry form. The Affiliate can use the commissions to pay
for new orders. With this process, the Company reduces operating expense and eliminates cumbersome accounting chores such as issuing
checks and reconciling bank statements. 

Full payment is required in U.S. Dollars prior to shipment of
any products. In most cases, once payment is received, products ordered are shipped directly by the Company s third party
manufacturers to the Company s distribution centers in Hong Kong and China. Once the products are received at the distribution
centers, they are shipped to the Affiliate placing the order. 

EFT-Phone and ToByTo reward program  

In February 2010, the Company assigned the worldwide distribution
and servicing rights to a product known as the  EFT-Phone  to Digital Development Partners, Inc.,  Digital ,
previously an unrelated company, in exchange for 79,265,000 shares of Digital s common stock. The shares the Company acquired
represent approximately 92% of Digital s outstanding common stock. The EFT-Phone is a cell phone which uses the Android operating
system. The worldwide distribution and servicing rights to the EFT-Phone include the right to sell the EFT-Phone to the Company s
Affiliates and others. Digital also acquired the rights to distribute all EFT-Phone accessories. Digital began distributing EFT-Phones
in July 2010. 

Starting from December 2010, the Company introduced reward programs
to its Affiliates. For example, upon joining a $3,000 program, each Affiliate must pay $3,000 as a non-refundable deposit. When
the Affiliate sponsors one new Affiliate, the Company will reward the first Affiliate with a $1,500 instant sponsor bonus. When
the first Affiliate sponsors at least two new Affiliates, and those two new Affiliates each also sponsor two new Affiliates, the
first Affiliate will have completed the first cycle of the program. The Company will then reward the first Affiliate with an additional
$1,500 bonus and deliver an EFT-phone and an e-pad for the cost of $1. After the completion of the first cycle, each Affiliate
will enter into the matrix of the second cycle. Upon completion of the second cycle, the Company will reward the first Affiliate
with $3,000. For each subsequent cycle thereafter within the matrix, each Affiliate will need to sponsor a new Affiliate in each
cycle in order to qualify for the reward. 

On April 1, 2012, the Company assigned network access rights
to ToByTo Limited,  ToByTo , a third-party company. The network access rights to ToByTo Limited include the right to
access EFT s Affiliate database for ToByTo s marketing campaign, and provides access to EFT s e-money system
to facilitate sales activities. ToByTo, in return, compensates EFT by paying access fees in an amount equal to 10% of the respective
enrollment fee of every Affiliate who enters the ToByTo e-phone program or another agreed upon amount. During the six months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company agreed to waive the access fees in lieu of ToByTo agreeing to purchase a portion of the
Company s overstocked inventory. 

eZGT Travel Program  

In May 2011, the Company introduced to its Affiliates a series
of travel programs attracting Affiliates to enjoy the benefits of travelling internationally. To participate in the Traveler programs,
one must initially make a non-refundable deposit according to the programs  requirements. When the Affiliate completes a
cycle of the program he joined, he will receive a bonus reward and the Affiliate only needs to pay $1 for his or her own trip.
The reward system of the travel program is similar to the ToByTo reward program. 

On April 1, 2012, the Company assigned network access rights
to eZGT Limited, a third party. The network access rights to eZGT Limited include the right to access EFT s Affiliate database
for eZGT s marketing campaign, and provides access to EFT s e-money system to facilitate sales activities. eZGT Limited,
in return, compensates EFT by paying access fees in an amount equal to 10% of the respective enrollment fee of every Affiliate
who enters the $300 and $3,000 travel programs or another agreed upon amount. However, for Affiliates who enter the $800 and $8,000
travel programs, eZGT will only pay access fees in the amount of $30 and $300, respectively. During the six months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, the Company agreed to waive the access fees in lieu of eZGT Limited agreeing to purchase a portion of the Company s
overstocked inventory for an agreed upon period of time. 

Market Environment  

The nutritional supplement and cosmetic e-business markets have
and continue to become increasingly competitive and are rapidly evolving. Barriers to entry are minimal and current and new competitors
can launch new websites at a relatively low cost. Many competitors in this area have greater financial, technical and marketing
resources than the Company does. Continued advancement in technology and increasing access to that technology is paving the way
for growth in direct marketing. The Company also faces competition for consumers from retailers, duty-free retailers, specialty
stores, department stores and specialty and general merchandise catalogs, many of which have greater financial and marketing resources
than the Company has. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company believes that it is well-positioned within the Asian consumer
market with its current plan of supplying U.S. merchandise brands to consumers and that its exposure to both the Asian and American
cultures gives it a competitive advantage. There can be no assurance that the Company will maintain its competitive edge or that
the Company will continue to provide solely U.S.-made merchandise. 

The Company s products are sensitive to business and personal
discretionary spending levels and tend to decline or grow more slowly during economic downturns, including downturns in any of
the Company s major markets. The current worldwide downturn is expected to adversely affect the Company s sales
and liquidity for the foreseeable future. Although the Company has mitigated decreases in sales by lowering its levels of inventory
to preserve cash on hand, the Company does not know when the downturn will subside and when consumer spending will increase from
its current depressed levels. Even if consumer spending increases, the Company is not sure when consumer spending will increase
for its products, which will affect its liquidity. 

The global economy is currently undergoing a period of unprecedented
volatility, and the future economic environment may continue to be less favorable than that of recent years. This has led, and
could further lead, to reduced consumer spending, and which may affect adversely spending on nutritional and beauty products and
other discretionary items, such as the Company s products. In addition, reduced consumer spending may force the Company and
its competitors to lower prices. These conditions may adversely affect the Company s revenues and profits. In addition, the
Company expects future operations to be affected by ToByTo  marketing and distribution of EFT phones, eZGT s marketing
of the travel program and the Company s water bottling operations. 

Results
of Operations    

Comparison for
the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Sales revenues, net  

Sales revenues, net decreased to approximately $62,000 for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 from approximately $145,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to
a decrease in product sales demand during the period. Sales revenues, net excludes revenue from shipping charges and reflects the
deduction of commission expense. The Company s policy is to pay commissions to Affiliates upon receipt of sales orders even
before revenue can be recognized. In addition, sales orders dropped from $ 37,500 to $18,950 which caused commission expense to
decrease to $10,370 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $23,900 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Gross
sales of products declined from approximately $110,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $19,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016, or 83%. The sales of promotional products decreased to approximately $54,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 from $60,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, or 9%. 

Shipping charges  

Shipping charges decreased to approximately
$5,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from approximately $12,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015,
mainly due to a significant decrease in sales. 

Cost of sales   

Cost of sales consists mainly of merchandise purchased from
vendors. Cost of sales decreased to approximately $44,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from approximately $68,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales revenues for the three months ended September
30, 2016 was 71%, which is 24% higher than the same period last year, mainly due to the increase in vendor prices during the period. 

Gross profit  

Gross profit decreased to approximately $24,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately $90,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Gross profit,
as a percentage of total revenues, was 34.6% during the current period compared with 56.8% for the three months ended September
30, 2015. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of total revenues was due to an increase in vendor prices during the period. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses  

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to approximately
$895,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately $1,212,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2015, mainly due to the decrease in legal fees, including the reversal of legal fees relating to the Tianquan construction
case as a result of the court decision in July 2016, and the decrease in rental expense in the current period compared with the
same period last year. 

Inventory obsolescence  

Inventory obsolescence increased to approximately $11,400 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to nil for the three months ended September 30, 2015, mainly due to an increase
in the amounts of inventory either at or nearing obsolescence in the current period as compared to the same period last year. 

Royalty expenses- related party  

Royalty expenses remained at $125,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. Since the current year annualized sales do not meet the minimum sales required to comply with the
terms of the agreement, an accrual was made during the period ended September 30, 2016 to recognize the expense based on the prorated
minimum contract amount instead of actual sales revenues. 

Interest income  

Interest income decreased to approximately $12,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to approximately $26,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Interest income
decreased primarily due to a decrease in investments in corporate bonds as compared to the prior period. 

Interest expense  

Interest expense increased to approximately $1,600 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $500 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was mainly due
to a slight increase in accrued interest pursuant to the amortization schedule for the Company s loan to finance its D O
insurance policy. 

Other income   

Other income remained at approximately $5,100 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Income tax expense (benefit)  

Income tax expense was nil for the three months ended September
30, 2016 as compared to a benefit of approximately $3,966,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The change was mainly
due to the reversal of the overaccrual for the provision of tax liabilities for the years 2008 to 2010 confirmed by the final report
received from the IRS in September 2015.

prices, cost of sales as a percentage of sales revenues for the six months ended September 30, 2016 was 66.7%, higher than last
year by 14.4%, mainly due to vendor price increases during the period.

$1,987,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately $2,560,000 for the six months ended September

expense  

Interest expense decreased to approximately $4,500 for the six
months ended September 30, 2016 from approximately $43,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in interest

for the years 2008 to 2010 in the three months ended June 30, 2015. 

Other income  

Other income decreased to approximately $18,000 for the six
months ended September 30, 2016 from approximately $22,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was mainly

ended September 30, 2016 as compared to a benefit of approximately $3,966,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2015. The

by the final report received from the IRS in September 2015.

Operating activities  

For the six months ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in
operating activities was $3,439,327. This was primarily due to a net loss of $2,161,732 adjusted by non-cash related expenses that
included depreciation expense of $98,461, provision for inventory obsolescence of $20,967, a net decrease in working capital items
of $1,395,721, and gain realized from the sales of securities available for sale of $1,302.

a net increase in working capital items of $1,100,412, and losses realized from the sales of securities available for sale of $12,850,
which were offset by settlement of previously accrued income tax, penalty and interest of $5,290,788. 

Investing activities  

Net cash provided by investing activities for the six months
ended September 30, 2016 was $1,077,263, primarily due to return of the prepayment of amounts relating to business development
activities planned by the Company from President Jack Qin of $1,000,000 and the proceeds from the sale of corporate bonds of $82,071. 

Net cash provided by investing activities for the six months
ended September 30, 2015 was $1,217,005, primarily due to proceeds from the sale of corporate bonds of $1,251,706. 

Financing activities  

Net cash used in financing activities for the six months
ended September 30, 2016 was $28,308, due to the repayment of a short-term loan for financing of the Company s current
year directors  and officers  liability insurance policy, which was offset by the increase in related party
payables by $230,000. For more information about the insurance policy, please see Note 9 to the consolidated financial
statements in this Report. 

Net cash used in financing activities for the six months ended
September 30, 2015 was $54,990, due to the repayment of a short-term loan for financing of the Company s current year directors 
and officers  liability insurance policy, which was offset by the increase in related party payables by $226,250. 

Working Capital  

Historically, cash and cash equivalents and securities available
for sale have been the Company s primary sources of liquidity. The Company believes its existing cash and cash equivalents
will not be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements for the next 12-month period. The working capital position changed
to a deficiency of approximately $12 million at September 30, 2016 compared to a deficiency of $9.8 million at March 31, 2016 as
a result of the return of $1.0 million advanced to President Jack Qin for the prepayment of amounts relating to business development
activities planned by the Company and a decrease in cash used in operations. 

There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain
further funds required for its continued working capital requirements. The ability of the Company to meet its financial obligations
and commitments will depend primarily upon the continued financial support of its directors and shareholders, the continued issuance
of equity to new shareholders, and its ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations. 

There is substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern as the continuation of the Company s business is dependent upon obtaining further long-term
financing and achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by the Company could result
in a significant dilution of the equity interests of its current shareholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans
would be available, will increase the Company s liabilities and future cash commitments. 

Balance Sheet Items   

Material changes in the Company s
balance sheet items between September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016 are discussed below: 

Securities Available for Sale  

Securities available for sale decreased
to $732,950 at September 30, 2016 compared to $810,344 at March 31, 2016, as the Company sold certain securities to fund operations. 

Inventories  

Inventory decreased to $189,109 at September
30, 2016 compared to $221,439 at March 31, 2016 due to the fact that the Company only ordered products on an  as needed 
basis to avoid overstocking and decreased inventory levels are adequate to meet the current period s needs. 

Property and Equipment  

Property and equipment increased to $10,295,046
at September 30, 2016 compared to $10,129,691 at March 31, 2016, mainly due to the effect of exchange rate changes on the value
of the property in Taiwan and scheduled depreciation expense being recorded. 

Related Party Receivable  

The Company advanced $1,000,000 to President
Jack Qin related to the prepayment of expenses for business development activities planned by the Company. The advance was repaid
to the Company in June 2016. 

Accounts Payable  

Accounts payable decreased to $1,783,191
at September 30, 2016 compared to $2,013,078 at March 31, 2016 due to an decrease in unpaid legal fees during the period. 

Commission Payable  

Commission payable slightly decreased to
$3,667,391 at September 30, 2016 compared to $3,682,236 at March 31, 2016 due to lower commissions earned by Affiliates during
the six months ended September 30, 2016.  

Contingent Liabilities  

Contingent liabilities decreased to $123,988
at September 30, 2016 compared to $205,087 at March 31, 2016 mainly due to the reversal of legal fees relating to the Tianquan
construction case as a result of the court decision in July 2016. 

Other Current Liabilities  

Other liabilities decreased to $5,289,346
at September 30, 2016 compared to $6,601,774 at March 31, 2016. The decrease is mainly due to the payment of $1,350,000 for the
commission payable pursuant to the settlement agreement relating to the Company s investment in Taiwan. 

Unearned Revenue  

Unearned revenue slightly decreased to
$3,193,556 at September 30, 2016 compared to $3,201,936 at March 31, 2016 due to the recording of unearned revenue resulting from
temporary delays associated with the recognition of revenue related to the sale of products or services to Affiliates. 

Contractual Obligations and Commitments  

The Company s contractual obligations and commitments
as of September 30, 2016 did not materially change from the amounts set forth in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
March 31, 2016. 

Commitments for Capital Expenditures  

Except as otherwise disclosed herein, the Company does not have
any commitments for any material capital expenditures. The Company does not have any commitments or arrangements from any person
to provide it with any additional capital. 

Except as disclosed in this Item 2, the Company does not know
of any trends or demands that affected, or are reasonably likely to affect, its capital resources or liquidity. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

The Company does not have any off-balance
sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on its financial condition. 

Significant Accounting Policies/Recent
Accounting Pronouncements  

See Item 1- Note 3 to the financial statements included as part
of this report for a description of the Company s significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements which
have, or potentially may have, a material impact on its financial statements. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

The Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles,  U.S. GAAP . The Company s significant accounting policies
are discussed in Note 2  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  to the consolidated financial statements included
in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission,  SEC , on July 13, 2016. 

Item
3.    
       Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.    

Not applicable. 

Item
4.   
       Controls and Procedures.    

(a)   
       Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

The Company s management, under the supervision and with
the participation of its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer, Messrs. Jack Jie Qin and William E. Sluss, respectively,
evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016, the end of the period covered by
this Report. The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports, such as this Form 10-Q, that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to
the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Based on that evaluation, Messrs. Qin and Sluss concluded that
the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016.  

The Company s disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of its disclosure
control system are met. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide
absolute 

 assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company
have been detected. 

(b)   
       Changes in Internal Controls    

There was no change in the Company s internal control
over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that is reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company has not fully remediated
the material weakness disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016. Management
is currently evaluating what steps, if any, can be taken in order to address the material weakness.
