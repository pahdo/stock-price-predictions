 2. 
 Basis of Presentation and Going Concern Considerations 
   
 The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2016. 
   
 For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2015. These unaudited interim condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015, included in the Company s Form 10-K filed on April 14, 2016, with the SEC. 
   
 The accompanying financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.  The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs.  The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is highly dependent upon management s ability to increase near-term operating cash flows and obtain additional working capital through the issuance of debt and or equity.  If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.

  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  
   
 This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) contains forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks, significant uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed, or implied, by those forward-looking statements. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of the words may, will, should, could, expects, plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, intends, potential, proposed, or continue or the negative of those terms. These statements are only predictions. In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors which may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the exceptions reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.

11 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   
   
 The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to raise additional capital and implement its business plan.  Since its inception, the Company has been funded by related parties through capital investment and borrowing of funds. 
   
 At September 30, 2016, the Company had total current assets of $159,826 compared to $245,123 at December 31, 2015.  Current assets consisted primarily of cash, and a loan receivable. The decrease in current assets $85,297 were primarily attributed to a decrease in cash of $106,199 and an increase in Loan receivable of $15,000 and in an accrued interest of $1,861. 
   
 At September 30, 2016, the Company had total current liabilities of $11,244 compared to $10,286 at December 31, 2015.  Current liabilities consisted primarily of the accounts payable and accrued liabilities, payroll liabilities. The decrease in our current liabilities was attributed to the reduction in amounts owed to related party and the reduction in credit card payable. 
   
 We had positive working capital of $148,582 as of September 30, 2016 compared to $234,837 as of December 31, 2015, a decrease of $86,255 or 37%. 
   
   Cashflow from Operating Activities   
   
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash used in operating activities was $(91,199) compared to $(109,065) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in the amounts of cash used for operating activities was primarily due to the decreased expenditures in amounts due to related parties and a reduction in the outstanding of a credit card payable. 
   
   Cashflow from Investing Activities   
   
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 cash used in investing activities was $(15,000) compared to $(90,000) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
   
   Cashflow from Financing Activities   
   
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash provided by financing activity was $nil compared to $nil provided during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
   
   Going Concern   
   
 We have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive acquisitions and activities. For these reasons, our auditors stated in their report on our audited financial statements that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern without further financing. 
   
   Future Financings   
   
 We will continue to rely on equity sales of our common shares in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of the equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our operations and other activities. 
   
   Impact of Inflation   
   
 We believe that the rate of inflation has had a negligible effect on our operations. 
   
   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   
   
 We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders. 

12 

Critical Accounting Policies   
   
 Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. 
   
 We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. 
   
   Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   
   
 From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date.  Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations upon adoption. 
   
  ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  
   
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item. 
   
  ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  
   
   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
   
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by our company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ).  Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016, due to the material weaknesses resulting from the Board of Directors not currently having any independent members and no director qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K, and controls were not designed and in place to ensure that all disclosures required were originally addressed in our financial statements.  Please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on April 14, 2016, for a complete discussion relating to the foregoing evaluation of Disclosures and Procedures. 
   
   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   
   
 Our management has also evaluated our internal control over financial reporting, and there have been no significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect those controls subsequent to the date of our last evaluation. 
   
 The Company is not required by current SEC rules to include, and does not include, an auditor's attestation report. The Company's registered public accounting firm has not attested to Management's reports on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
