  The use of the words  we,   us  or  our  refers to Griffin-American Healthcare REIT III, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including Griffin-American Healthcare REIT III Holdings, LP, except where the context otherwise requires. 
   
  1. Organization and Description of Business    
  Griffin-American Healthcare REIT III, Inc., a Maryland corporation, was incorporated on   January 11, 2013   and therefore we consider that our date of inception. We were initially capitalized on   January 15, 2013  . We invest in a diversified portfolio of real estate properties, focusing primarily on medical office buildings, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, senior housing and other healthcare-related facilities. We also operate healthcare-related facilities utilizing the structure permitted by the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007, which is commonly referred to as a  RIDEA  structure (the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, authorizing the RIDEA structure were enacted as part of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008). We also originate and acquire secured loans and real estate-related investments on an infrequent and opportunistic basis. We generally seek investments that produce current income. We qualified to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Code, for federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended December 31,   2014  , and we intend to continue to qualify to be taxed as a REIT.  
  On February 26, 2014, we commenced a best efforts initial public offering, or our initial offering, in which we initially offered to the public up to   $1,750,000,000   in shares of our common stock for   $10.00   per share in our primary offering and up to   $150,000,000   in shares of our common stock pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, or the DRIP, for   $9.50   per share, aggregating up to   $1,900,000,000  . We reserved the right to reallocate the shares of common stock we offered in our initial offering between the primary offering and the DRIP. As such, during our initial offering, we reallocated an aggregate of   $115,000,000   in shares from the DRIP to the primary offering. Accordingly, we offered to the public up to   $1,865,000,000   in shares of our common stock in our primary offering and up to   $35,000,000   in shares of our common stock pursuant to the DRIP. 
  On March 12, 2015, we terminated the primary portion of our initial offering. We continued to offer up to   $35,000,000   in shares of our common stock through our initial offering pursuant to the DRIP until the termination of the DRIP portion of our initial offering and deregistration of our initial offering on April 22, 2015. As of April 22, 2015, we had received and accepted subscriptions in our initial offering for   184,930,598   shares of our common stock, or   $1,842,618,000  , excluding shares of our common stock issued pursuant to the DRIP. As of April 22, 2015, a total of   $18,511,000   in distributions were reinvested that resulted in   1,948,563   shares of our common stock being issued pursuant to the DRIP. 
  On March 25, 2015, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, to register a maximum of   $250,000,000   of additional shares of our common stock pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, or the Secondary DRIP Offering. The Registration Statement on Form S-3 was automatically effective with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, upon its filing; however, we did not commence offering shares pursuant to the Secondary DRIP Offering until April 22, 2015, following the deregistration of our initial offering. Effective October 5, 2016, we amended and restated the DRIP, or the Amended and Restated DRIP, to amend the price at which shares of our common stock are issued pursuant to the Secondary DRIP Offering.   See Note 21, Subsequent Events     Amended and Restated Distribution Reinvestment Plan Price, for a further discussion. As of   September 30, 2016  , a total of   $92,250,000   in distributions were reinvested and   9,709,538   shares of our common stock were issued pursuant to the Secondary DRIP Offering. 
  We conduct substantially all of our operations through Griffin-Am  erican Healthcare REIT III Holdings, LP, or our operating partnership. We are externally advised by     Griffin-American Healthcare REIT III Advisor, LLC, or Griffin-American Advisor, or our advisor,     pursuant to an advisory agreement, or the Advisory Agreement, between us and our advisor. The Advisory Agreement was effective as of February 26, 2014 and had a     one  -year term, but is subject to successive     one  -year renewals upon the mutual consent of the parties.     The Advisory Agreement was last renewed pursuant to the mutual consent of the parties on February 25, 2016 and expires on February 26, 2017. O  ur advisor uses its best efforts, subject to the oversight, review and approval of our board of directors, or our board, to, among other things, research, identify, review and make investments in and dispositions of properties and securities on our behalf consistent with our investment policies and objectives. Our advisor performs its duties and responsibilities under the Advisory Agreement as our fiduciary. Our a  dvisor is   75.0%   owned and managed by American Healthcare Investors, LLC, or American Healthcare Investors, and   25.0%   owned by a wholly owned subsidiary of Griffin Capital Corporation, or Griffin Capital, or collectively, our co-sponsors. Effective March 1, 2015, American Healthcare Investors is   47.1%   owned by AHI Group Holdings, LLC (formerly known as American Healthcare Investors LLC), or AHI Group Holdings,   45.1%   indirectly owned by NorthStar Asset Management Group, Inc. (NYSE: NSAM), or NSAM, and   7.8%   owned by James F. Flaherty III,   one   of NSAM s partners. NSAM has announced its intention to

merge with Colony Capital, Inc. (NYSE: CLNY) and NorthStar Realty Finance Corp. (NYSE: NRF) to form a new combined company, Colony NorthStar, Inc. The proposed merger is subject to substantial closing conditions, including the required approval from each respective company s stockholders, governmental and regulatory agencies and third parties. We are not affiliated with Griffin Capital, Griffin Capital Securities, LLC, or Griffin Securities, or our dealer manager, NSAM, Mr. Flaherty, Colony Capital, Inc. or NorthStar Realty Finance Corp.; however, we are affiliated with Griffin-American Advisor, American Healthcare Investors and AHI Group Holdings. 
  We currently operate through   six   reportable business segments: medical office buildings, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, senior housing, senior housing       RIDEA and integrated senior health campuses. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had completed   47   real estate acquisitions whereby we owned and/or operated   88   properties, comprising   91   buildings, and   102   integrated senior health campuses including completed development projects, or approximately   11,880,000   square feet of gross leasable area, or GLA, for an aggregate contract purchase price of   $2,695,600,000  . In addition, as of   September 30, 2016  , we had acquired real estate-related investments for an aggregate purchase price of   $144,176,000  .  
   
  2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    
  The summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. Such condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto are the representations of our management, who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, in all material respects, and have been consistently applied in preparing our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.  
  Basis of Presentation 
  Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our operating partnership, the wholly owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership and all non-wholly owned subsidiaries in which we have control, as well as any variable interest entities, or VIEs, in which we are the primary beneficiary. We evaluate our ability to control an entity, and whether the entity is a VIE and of which we are the primary beneficiary, by considering substantive terms of the arrangement and identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impacts the entity s economic performance as defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 810,   Consolidation  , or ASC Topic 810. 
  We operate     and intend to     co  ntinue to operate in an umbrella partnership REIT structure in which our operating partnership, or wholly owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership and all non-wholly owned subsidiaries of which we have control, will own substantially all   of the interests in properties acquired on our behalf. We are the sole general partner of o  ur operating partnership and as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we owned greater than a   99.99%   general partnership interest therein. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our advisor owned less than a   0.01%   limited partnership interest in our operating partnership.  
  Because we are the sole general partner of our operating partnership and have unilateral control over its management and major operating decisions (even if additional limited partners are admitted to our operating partnership), the accounts of our operating partnership are consolidated in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.  
  Interim Unaudited Financial Data  
  Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by us in accordance with GAAP in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the SEC. Certain information and footnote disclosures required for annual financial statements have been condensed or excluded pursuant to SEC rules and regulations. Accordingly, our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are, in our view, of a normal recurring nature and necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim period. Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year; such full year results may be less favorable.  
  In preparing our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, management has evaluated subsequent events through the financial statement issuance date. We believe that although the disclosures contained herein are adequate to prevent the information presented from being misleading, our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements

     Table of Contents  
    
  GRIFFIN-AMERICAN HEALTHCARE REIT III, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)   (Continued) 

should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016.  
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are made and evaluated on an on-going basis using information that is currently available as well as various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates, perhaps in material adverse ways, and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions. 
  Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts 
  Tenant and resident receivables and unbilled deferred rent receivables are carried net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts. An allowance is maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain tenants or residents to meet the contractual obligations under their lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for deferred rent receivables arising from the straight-line recognition of rents. Such allowances are charged to bad debt expense, which is included in general and administrative in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Our determination of the adequacy of these allowances is based primarily upon evaluations of historical loss experience, the tenant s or resident s financial condition, security deposits, letters of credit, lease guarantees, current economic conditions and other relevant factors.  
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   $10,409,000   and   $11,204,000  , respectively, in allowance for uncollectible accounts, which was determined necessary to reduce receivables to our estimate of the amount recoverable. For the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we did not write off any receivables to bad debt expense. For the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   $1,467,000   and   $4,059,000  , respectively, of our receivables were written off against the allowance for uncollectible accounts. For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we did not write off any receivables against the allowance for uncollectible accounts.  
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we did not have any allowance for uncollectible accounts for deferred rent receivables. For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we did not write off any of our deferred rent receivables directly to bad debt expense. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   $28,000   and   $0  , respectively, of our deferred rent receivables were directly written off to bad debt expense.  
  Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities  
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , accounts payable and accrued liabilities consisted primarily of reimbursement of payroll related costs to the managers of our senior housing   RIDEA facilities and integrated senior health campuses of   $18,521,000   and   $19,391,000  , respectively, insurance payables of   $17,277,000   and   $21,689,000  , respectively, accrued property taxes of   $14,739,000   and   $11,447,000  , respectively, and accrued distributions of   $9,647,000   and   $9,745,000  , respectively. 
  Derivative Financial Instruments  
  We are exposed to the effect of interest rate changes in the normal course of business. We seek to mitigate these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures, which include the occasional use of derivatives. Our primary strategy in entering into derivative contracts, such as fixed interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, is to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our variable-rate debt to fixed-rate debt. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes.  
  Derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 815,   Derivatives and Hedging  , or ASC Topic 815. ASC Topic 815 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities. Since our derivative instruments are not designated as hedge instruments, they do not qualify for hedge accounting under ASC Topic 815. Changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative financial instruments are recorded as a component of interest expense in gain (loss) in fair value of derivative financial instruments in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

See Note 9, Derivative Financial Instruments  , and   Note 15, Fair Value Measurements  , for a further discussion of our derivative financial instruments. 
  Reclassifications  
  As of December 31, 2015,   $1,200,000   of deferred financing costs, net, related to our mortgage loans payable have been reclassified from other assets, net to mortgage loans payable, net in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets to conform to the current period presentation in accordance with Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,   or ASU 2015-03. Such reclassification did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
  Recently Issued or Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers,   or ASU 2014-09, which replaces the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 provides a five-step framework to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. Since its issuance, the FASB has amended several aspects of ASU 2014-09, including provisions that address principal-versus-agent implementation guidance and identifying performance obligations. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. It may be adopted either by restating all years presented in the financial statements or by recording the impact of adoption as an adjustment to retained earnings at the beginning of the year of adoption. We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 and its amendments on January 1, 2018 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,   or ASU 2015-02, which amends the consolidation analysis required under ASC Topic 810. Specifically, ASU 2015-02: (i) modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs; (ii) eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership; and (iii) amends the effect of fee arrangements in the primary beneficiary determination. Further, the application of ASU 2015-02 permits the use of either the full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption approach. ASU 2015-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 with early adoption permitted. We adopted ASU 2015-02 on January 1, 2016, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , or ASU 2015-03, which amends the presentation of debt issuance costs in the financial statements to present such costs as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of such costs is required to be reported as interest expense. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15,   Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements  , or ASU 2015-15, which clarified that debt issuance costs associated with line of credit arrangements may continue to be presented as an asset, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line of credit arrangement. The application of ASU 2015-03 requires retrospective adjustment of all prior periods presented. ASU 2015-03 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 with early adoption permitted. We adopted ASU 2015-03 on January 1, 2016, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,   Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments,   or ASU 2015-16, which eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments in a business combination. The cumulative effect of a measurement period adjustment as a result of a change in the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed as of the acquisition date, is required to be recorded in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount is determined, rather than retrospectively. Further, ASU 2015-16 requires that the acquirer present separately on the face of the income statement, or disclose in the notes, the portion of the amount recorded in the current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not yet been made available for issuance. We adopted ASU 2015-16 on January 1, 2016, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  , or ASU 2016-01, which amends the classification and measurement of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 revises

the accounting related to: (i) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities; and (ii) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. ASU 2016-01 also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, with respect to only certain of the amendments in ASU 2016-01, for financial statements that have not yet been made available for issuance. ASU 2016-01 requires the application of the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption, with certain exceptions. We have not yet determined the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-01 on January 1, 2018 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  , or ASU 2016-02, which amends the guidance on accounting for leases, including extensive amendments to the disclosure requirements. Under ASU 2016-02, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: (i) a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease; and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Under ASU 2016-02, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not yet been made available for issuance. ASU 2016-02 requires a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. We have not yet determined the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,   or ASU 2016-09, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 requires disclosures about a change in accounting principle under ASC 250,   Accounting Changes     and Error Corrections  ,   in the period of adoption. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not yet been made available for issuance. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on January 1, 2017 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,   or ASU 2016-13, which introduces a new approach to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments based on expected losses. It also modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and provides for a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted after December 15, 2018. We have not yet determined the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,   or ASU 2016-15, which intends to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We have not yet determined the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-15 on January 1, 2018 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,   Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory,   or ASU 2016-16, which removes the prohibition in ASC 740,   Income Taxes  , against the immediate recognition of the current and deferred income tax effects of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. ASU 2016-16 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We have not yet determined the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-16 on January 1, 2018 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17,   Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control  , or ASU 2016-17, which amends the consolidation requirements that apply to a single decision maker s evaluation of interests held through related parties that are under common control when it is determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. ASU 2016-17 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-17 on December 15, 2016 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

    Our advisor was paid in cash, as compensation for services in connection with real estate-related investments, an acquisition fee of   2.00%   of the total amount advanced or invested through   September 30, 2016  . 
              (3) 
    On February 4, 2015, we acquired   eight   promissory notes at par in the aggregate outstanding principal amount of   $60,217,000  , or the Mezzanine Notes, comprising   four   fixed-rate notes in the aggregate outstanding principal amount of   $28,650,000  , or the Mezzanine Fixed Rate Notes, and   four   floating-rate notes in the aggregate outstanding principal amount of   $31,567,000  , or the Mezzanine Floating Rate Notes. The Mezzanine Notes evidence interests in a portion of a mezzanine loan that consisted in total of   40   promissory notes in the aggregate outstanding principal amount of   $389,852,000  . The mezzanine loan is secured by pledges of equity interests in the owners of a portfolio of domestic healthcare properties, which such owners are themselves owned indirectly by a non-wholly owned subsidiary of NorthStar Realty Finance Corp. The maturity date of the Mezzanine Floating Rate Notes may be extended by   three   successive   one  -year extension periods at the borrower s option, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. In October 2016, the borrower exercised its right to extend the maturity date of the Mezzanine Floating Rate Notes for one year to December 2017. 
              (4) 
    We entered into a facility agreement with Caring Homes (TFP) Group Limited, or the CHG Borrower, an unaffiliated third party, on September 16, 2015. The facility agreement, as amended, matures on November 15, 2016. The facility agreement, as amended, is collateralized by   two   senior housing facilities in the United Kingdom, or the UK, and the income from the CHG Borrower s operations. Based on the currency exchange rate as of   September 30, 2016  , the maximum amount of advances available was    16,000,000  , or approximately   $20,750,000  , and the outstanding balance as of   September 30, 2016   was    15,276,000  , or approximately   $19,812,000  . Based on the currency exchange rate as of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $938,000   remained available for future funding under Crown Senior Care Facility, subject to certain conditions set forth in the applicable loan agreement, as amended. As of   September 30, 2016  , the CHG Borrower has been identified as a VIE. We do not consolidate such VIE because we do not have the ability to control the activities that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance. Our exposure to loss as a result of involvement with such VIE is limited to the outstanding balance of Crown Senior Care Facility.  
              (5) 
    Balance represents the original principal balance, increased by any subsequent advances and decreased by any subsequent principal paydowns, and only requires monthly interest payments. The Mezzanine Floating Rate Notes, Mezzanine Fixed Rate Notes and Crown Senior Care Facility are subject to certain prepayment restrictions if repaid before the respective maturity dates. 
              (6) 
    On October 15, 2015, we acquired a commercial mortgage-backed debt security, or the debt security, for a purchase price of   $60,429,000   from an unaffiliated third party. The debt security was issued by FREMF 2015-KS03 Mortgage Trust, or the Mortgage Trust, and represents a   10.0%   beneficial ownership interest in the Mortgage Trust. The Mortgage Trust owns a pool of   59   mortgage loans that are secured by   59   domestic senior housing facilities. The debt security bears an interest rate on the stated principal amount thereof equal to   4.24%   per annum, the terms of which security provide for monthly interest-only payments. The debt security matures on August 25, 2025 at a stated amount of   $93,433,000  , resulting in an anticipated yield-to-maturity of   10.0%   per annum. The debt security is subordinate to all other interests in the Mortgage Trust and is not guaranteed by a government-sponsored entity. We classify our debt security investment as held-to-maturity and we have not recorded any unrealized holding gains or losses on such investment.  
     We reimburse our advisor or its affiliates for acquisition expenses related to selecting, evaluating and acquiring assets. The reimbursement of acquisition expenses, acquisition fees, real estate commissions and other fees paid to unaffiliated parties will not exceed, in the aggregate,   6.0%   of the contract purchase price or total development costs, unless fees in excess of such limits are approved by a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors. For the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , such fees and expenses noted above did not exceed   6.0%   of the contract purchase price of our real estate-related investments.

  9. Derivative Financial Instruments    
  Consistent with ASC Topic 815, we record derivative financial instruments in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or a liability measured at fair value. ASC Topic 815 permits special hedge accounting if certain requirements are met. Hedge accounting allows for gains and losses on derivatives designated as hedges to be offset by the change in value of the hedged item or items or to be deferred in other comprehensive income (loss).  
  We did not have any derivative financial instruments as of   December 31, 2015  . The following table lists the derivative financial instruments held by us as of   September 30, 2016  :   

  As of   September 30, 2016  , none of our derivatives were designated as hedges. Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage our exposure to interest rate movements, but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements of ASC Topic 815. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recorded as a component of interest expense in gain (loss) in fair value of derivative financial instruments in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we did not have any derivative financial instruments. For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded a decrease (increase) of   $989,000   and   $(54,000)  , respectively, to interest expense in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss related to the change in the fair value of our derivative financial instruments.  
  See Note 15, Fair Value Measurements  , for a further discussion of the fair value of our derivative financial instruments. 
   
  10. Identified Intangible Liabilities, Net

Amortization expense on below-market leases for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $189,000   and   $86,000  , respectively, and for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $466,000   and   $274,000  , respectively.

11. Commitments and Contingencies    
  Litigation 
  We are not presently subject to any material litigation nor, to our knowledge, is any material litigation threatened against us, which if determined unfavorably to us, would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Environmental Matters 
  We follow a policy of monitoring our properties for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. While there can be no assurance that a material environmental liability does not exist at our properties, we are not currently aware of any environmental liability with respect to our properties that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Further, we are not aware of any material environmental liability or any unasserted claim or assessment with respect to an environmental liability that we believe would require additional disclosure or the recording of a loss contingency.  
  Other 
  Our other commitments and contingencies include the usual obligations of real estate owners and operators in the normal course of business, which include calls/puts to sell/acquire properties. In our view, these matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

As our advisor, Griffin-American Advisor is entitled to special redemption rights of its limited partnership units. The noncontrolling interest of our advisor in our operating partnership that has redemption features outside of our control is accounted for as redeemable noncontrolling interest and is presented outside of permanent equity in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.   See Note 14, Related Party Transactions     Liquidity Stage   Subordinated Participation Interest   Subordinated Distribution Upon Listing and   Note 14, Related Party Transactions     Subordinated Distribution Upon Termination, for a further discussion of the redemption features of the limited partnership units.

  Through the termination of the primary portion of our initial offering on March 12, 2015, we paid our dealer manager a dealer manager fee of up to   3.0%   of the gross offering proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock in our initial offering other than shares of our common stock sold pursuant to the DRIP. For the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we incurred   $0   and   $27,789,000  , respectively, in dealer manager fees to our dealer manager. Such fees were charged to stockholders  equity as such amounts were paid to our dealer manager or its affiliates from the gross proceeds of our initial offering.  
  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
  The changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of noncontrolling interests, by component consisted of the following for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Noncontrolling Interests 
  On December 1, 2015, we, through Trilogy REIT Holdings, completed the acquisition of approximately   96.7%   of the outstanding equity interests of Trilogy. As of   September 30, 2016  , Trilogy REIT Holdings owned approximately   96.7%   of Trilogy. We are the indirect owner of a   70.0%   interest in Trilogy REIT Holdings and serve as the sole manager of Trilogy REIT Holdings. NorthStar Healthcare Income, Inc., through certain of its subsidiaries, owns a   30.0%   ownership interest in Trilogy REIT Holdings. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   30.0%   of the net earnings of Trilogy REIT Holdings were allocated to noncontrolling interests. 
  In connection with the acquisition and operation of Trilogy, profit interest units in Trilogy, or the Profit Interests, were issued to Trilogy Management Services, LLC and an independent director of Trilogy, both are unaffiliated third parties that manage or direct the day-to day operations of Trilogy. The Profit Interests consist of time-based or performance-based commitments. The time-based Profit Interests were measured at their grant date fair value and vest in increments of   20.0%   on each anniversary of the respective grant date over a   five  -year period. We amortize the time-based Profit Interests on a straight-line basis over the vesting periods, which are recorded to general and administrative in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The performance-based Profit Interests are subject to a performance commitment and vest upon liquidity events as defined in the Profit Interests agreements. The performance-based Profit Interests were measured at their grant date fair value and immediately expensed. The performance-based Profit Interests will be subject to fair value measurements until vesting occurs with changes to fair value recorded to general and administrative in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recognized stock compensation expense related to the Profit Interests of   $196,000   and   $589,000  , respectively. 
  There were   no   canceled, expired or exercised Profit Interests during the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   no   Profit Interests were vested. The nonvested awards are presented as noncontrolling interests and will be re-classified to redeemable noncontrolling interests upon vesting as they have redemption features outside of our control similar to the common units held by Trilogy s pre-closing management once vested.   See Note 12, Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests  , for a further discussion. 
  On January 6, 2016, one of our consolidated subsidiaries issued non-voting preferred shares of beneficial interests to qualified investors for total proceeds of   $125,000  . These preferred shares of beneficial interests are entitled to receive cumulative preferential cash dividends at the rate of   12.5%   per annum. In accordance with ASC Topic 810, we classify the value of the subsidiary s preferred shares of beneficial interests as noncontrolling interests in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets and the dividends of the preferred shares of beneficial interests as net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

In addition, as of   September 30, 2016  , we owned an   86.0%   interest in a consolidated limited liability company that owns the Lakeview IN Medical Plaza property we acquired on January 21, 2016. As such,   14.0%   of the earnings of the Lakeview IN Medical Plaza property were allocated to noncontrolling interests for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Distribution Reinvestment Plan 
  We adopted the DRIP that allowed stockholders to purchase additional shares of our common stock through the reinvestment of distributions at an offering price equal to   95.0%   of the primary offering price of our initial offering, subject to certain conditions. We had registered and reserved   $35,000,000   in shares of our common stock for sale pursuant to the DRIP in our initial offering at an offering price of   $9.50   per share, which we terminated on April 22, 2015. On March 25, 2015, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 under the Securities Act to register a maximum of   $250,000,000   of additional shares of our common stock pursuant to the Secondary DRIP Offering. The Registration Statement on Form S-3 was automatically effective with the SEC upon its filing; however, we did not commence offering shares pursuant to the Secondary DRIP Offering until April 22, 2015, following the deregistration of our initial offering. Effective October 5, 2016, the Amended and Restated DRIP amended the price at which shares of our common stock are issued pursuant to the Secondary DRIP Offering.   See Note 21, Subsequent Events     Amended and Restated Distribution Reinvestment Plan Price, for a further discussion. 
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   $16,199,000   and   $16,441,000  , respectively, in distributions were reinvested that resulted in   1,705,192   and   1,730,648   shares of our common stock, respectively, being issued pursuant to the DRIP and the Secondary DRIP Offering. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   $48,692,000   and   $43,087,000  , respectively, in distributions were reinvested that resulted in   5,124,834   and   4,535,536   shares of our common stock, respectively, being issued pursuant to the DRIP and the Secondary DRIP Offering.  
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , a total of   $110,761,000   and   $62,069,000  , respectively, in distributions were reinvested that resulted in   11,658,101   and   6,533,267   shares of our common stock, respectively, being issued pursuant to the DRIP and the Secondary DRIP Offering.  
  Share Repurchase Plan 
  Our board has approved a share repurchase plan. Our share repurchase plan allows for repurchases of shares of our common stock by us when certain criteria are met. Share repurchases will be made at the sole discretion of our board. Subject to the availability of the funds for share repurchases, we will limit the number of shares of our common stock repurchased during any calendar year to   5.0%   of the weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding during the prior calendar year; provided, however, that shares subject to a repurchase requested upon the death of a stockholder will not be subject to this cap. Funds for the repurchase of shares of our common stock will come exclusively from the cumulative proceeds we receive from the sale of shares of our common stock pursuant to the DRIP and the Secondary DRIP Offering.  
  All repurchases will be subject to a   one  -year holding period, except for repurchases made in connection with a stockholder s death or  qualifying disability,  as defined in our share repurchase plan. Further, all share repurchases will be repurchased following a   one  -year holding period at a price between   92.5%   and   100%   of each stockholder s repurchase amount, depending on the period of time their shares have been held. Until October 4, 2016, the repurchase amount for shares repurchased under our share repurchase plan was equal to or lower than the most recent per share offering price. However, if shares of our common stock were repurchased in connection with a stockholder s death or qualifying disability, the repurchase price was no less than   100%   of the price paid to acquire the shares of our common stock from us. Effective October 5, 2016, we amended the price at which shares of our common stock are repurchased pursuant to our amended and restated share repurchase plan, or Amended and Restated Share Repurchase Plan.   See Note 21, Subsequent Events     Amended and Restated Share Repurchase Plan, for a further discussion. Furthermore, our share repurchase plan provides that if there are insufficient funds to honor all repurchase requests, pending requests will be honored among all requests for repurchase in any given repurchase period as follows: first, pro rata as to repurchases sought upon a stockholder s death; next, pro rata as to repurchases sought by stockholders with a qualifying disability; and, finally, pro rata as to other repurchase requests.  
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we received share repurchase requests and repurchased   933,974   and   205,910   shares of our common stock, respectively, for an aggregate of   $8,835,000   and   $2,043,000  , respectively, at an average repurchase price of   $9.46   and   $9.92   per share, respectively. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we received share repurchase requests and repurchased   1,564,814   and   286,720   shares of our common stock, respectively, for an aggregate of   $14,833,000   and   $2,846,000  , respectively, at an average repurchase price of   $9.48   and   $9.93   per share, respectively.

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we received share repurchase requests and repurchased   1,945,743   and   380,929   shares of our common stock, respectively, for an aggregate of   $18,594,000   and   $3,761,000  , respectively, at an average price of   $9.56   and   $9.87   per share, respectively. All shares were repurchased using proceeds we received from the sale of shares of our common stock pursuant to the DRIP and the Secondary DRIP Offering.  
  2013 Incentive Plan 
  We adopted the 2013 Incentive Plan, or our incentive plan, pursuant to which our board or a committee of our independent directors may make grants of options, shares of restricted common stock, stock purchase rights, stock appreciation rights or other awards to our independent directors, employees and consultants. The maximum number of shares of our common stock that may be issued pursuant to our incentive plan is   2,000,000   shares.  
  Through   September 30, 2016  , we granted an aggregate of   30,000   shares of our restricted common stock, as defined in our incentive plan, to our independent directors in connection with their initial election or re-election to our board, of which   20.0%   vested on the grant date and   20.0%   will vest on each of the first   four   anniversaries of the grant date. In addition, through   September 30, 2016  , we granted an aggregate of   30,000   shares of our restricted common stock, as defined in our incentive plan, to our independent directors in consideration for their past services rendered. These shares of restricted common stock vest under the same period described above. Shares of our restricted common stock may not be sold, transferred, exchanged, assigned, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise encumbered. Such restrictions expire upon vesting. Shares of our restricted common stock have full voting rights and rights to distributions.  
  From the applicable dates that the required service periods began, or the service inception dates, to the applicable grant dates, we recognized compensation expense related to the shares of our restricted common stock based on the reporting date fair value, which was estimated at   $10.00   per share, the then most recent price paid to acquire a share of common stock in our initial offering. Beginning on the applicable grant dates, compensation cost related to the shares of our restricted common stock is measured based on the applicable grant date fair value, which we estimated at   $10.00   per share, the then most recent price paid to acquire a share of common stock in our initial offering. Stock compensation expense is recognized from the applicable service inception dates to the vesting date for each vesting tranche (i.e., on a tranche-by-tranche basis) using the accelerated attribution method. 
  ASC Topic 718,   Compensation       Stock Compensation,   requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we did not assume any forfeitures.  
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recognized compensation expense related to the director grants of   $90,000   and   $33,000  , respectively, and for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recognized compensation expense related to the director grants of   $151,000   and   $83,000  , respectively, which is included in general and administrative in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.  
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there was   $278,000   and   $129,000  , respectively, of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested shares of our restricted common stock. As of   September 30, 2016  , this expense is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted average period of   1.93   years.  
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the weighted average grant date fair value of the nonvested shares of our restricted common stock was   $400,000   and   $210,000  , respectively. A summary of the status of the nonvested shares of our restricted common stock as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   and the changes for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , is presented below:

For the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our advisor and its affiliates were not compensated for any additional services.

The amount of disposition fees paid, when added to the real estate commissions paid to unaffiliated parties, will not exceed the lesser of the customary competitive real estate commission

or an amount equal to   6.0%   of the contract sales price. For the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we did not incur any disposition fees to our advisor or its affiliates. 
  Subordinated Participation Interest 
  Subordinated Distribution of Net Sales Proceeds    
  In the event of liquidation, we will pay our advisor a subordinated distribution of net sales proceeds. The distribution will be equal to   15.0%   of the remaining net proceeds from the sales of properties, after distributions to our stockholders, in the aggregate, of: (i) a full return of capital raised from stockholders (less amounts paid to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase plan); plus (ii) an annual   7.0%   cumulative, non-compounded return on the gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock, as adjusted for distributions of net sales proceeds. Actual amounts to be received depend on the sale prices of properties upon liquidation. For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we did not pay any such distributions to our advisor. 
  Subordinated Distribution Upon Listing    
  Upon the listing of shares of our common stock on a national securities exchange, in redemption of our advisor s limited partnership units, we will pay our advisor a distribution equal to   15.0%   of the amount by which: (i) the market value of our outstanding common stock at listing plus distributions paid prior to listing exceeds (ii) the sum of the total amount of capital raised from stockholders (less amounts paid to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase plan) and the amount of cash that, if distributed to stockholders as of the date of listing, would have provided them an annual   7.0%   cumulative, non-compounded return on the gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock through the date of listing. Actual amounts to be paid depend upon the market value of our outstanding stock at the time of listing, among other factors. For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we did not pay any such distributions to our advisor. 
  Subordinated Distribution Upon Termination 
  Pursuant to the Agreement of Limited Partnership, as amended, of our operating partnership, upon termination or non-renewal of the Advisory Agreement, our advisor will also be entitled to a subordinated distribution in redemption of its limited partnership units from our operating partnership equal to   15.0%   of the amount, if any, by which: (i) the appraised value of our assets on the termination date, less any indebtedness secured by such assets, plus total distributions paid through the termination date, exceeds (ii) the sum of the total amount of capital raised from stockholders (less amounts paid to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase plan) and the total amount of cash equal to an annual   7.0%   cumulative, non-compounded return on the gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock through the termination date. In addition, our advisor may elect to defer its right to receive a subordinated distribution upon termination until either a listing or other liquidity event, including a liquidation, sale of substantially all of our assets or merger in which our stockholders receive in exchange for their shares of our common stock, shares of a company that are traded on a national securities exchange. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we had not recorded any charges to earnings related to the subordinated distribution upon termination.  
  Stock Purchase Plans    
  Effective January 1, 2015, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Jeffrey T. Hanson, our President, Chief Operating Officer and Director, Danny Prosky, and our Executive Vice President, General Counsel, Mathieu B. Streiff, each executed stock purchase plans, or the 2015 Stock Purchase Plans, whereby they each irrevocably agreed to invest   100%   of their net after-tax base salary and cash bonus compensation earned as employees of American Healthcare Investors directly into our company by purchasing shares of our common stock. In addition, our former Chief Financial Officer, Shannon K S Johnson, our Executive Vice President   Acquisitions, Stefan K.L. Oh, our Assistant General Counsel and Secretary, Cora Lo, and our Vice President   Asset Management, Chris Rooney, each executed similar 2015 Stock Purchase Plans whereby each irrevocably agreed to invest   15.0%  ,   15.0%  ,   10.0%   and   15.0%  , respectively, of their net after-tax base salaries that were earned as employees of American Healthcare Investors directly into our company by purchasing shares of our common stock.  
  Purchases of shares of our common stock pursuant to the 2015 Stock Purchase Plans commenced with the officers  regularly scheduled payroll payment paid on or after January 1, 2015. The shares of common stock were purchased at a price of   $9.00   per share, reflecting the purchase price of the shares in our initial offering, exclusive of selling commissions and the dealer manager fee.

The table below presents our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   December 31, 2015  , aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which those measurements fall: 

There were no transfers into or out of fair value measurement levels during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  Derivative Financial Instruments 
  We use interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to manage interest rate risk associated with floating-rate debt. The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, as well as option volatility. The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined by netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves.  
  To comply with the provisions of ASC Topic 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  , or ASC Topic 820, we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees.  
  Although we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivative financial instruments fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with these instruments utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and our counterparty. However, as of   September 30, 2016  , we have assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our derivative positions and have determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives. As a result, we have determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  Contingent Consideration 
  Assets 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have not recorded any contingent consideration receivables. In connection with our purchase of King of Prussia PA MOB in January 2015, there was a contingent consideration receivable in the amount of either   $0   or   $1,100,000  . We would have received   $1,100,000   in the event that   within one year of the acquisition   date certain criteria were not met, including the seller leasing   4,536   square feet of GLA meeting certain lease terms, occupancy by the tenant, delivery of a signed estoppel by the tenant and our receipt of the first month s rent under the lease. Such contingency expired in January 2016. In addition, in connection with our acquisition of Mt. Juliet TN MOB in March 2015, there is a contingent consideration receivable in the range of   $0   up to a maximum of   $355,000  . We would receive payment of contingent consideration in the event that a tenant occupying   6,611   square feet of GLA terminates their lease prior to March 31, 2018, and to the extent there is a shortfall in rent from any replacement tenant. As of   September 30, 2016  , we do not believe that we will receive such amounts and therefore we have not recorded any contingent consideration receivables. When recorded by us,

contingent consideration receivables will be included in other assets, net in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
  Liabilities 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we have accrued   $16,559,000   and   $5,912,000  , respectively, as contingent consideration obligations in connection with our property acquisitions, which is included in security deposits, prepaid rent and other liabilities in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Such consideration will be paid upon various conditions being met, including our tenants achieving certain operating performance metrics and sellers  leasing unoccupied space, as discussed below.  
  Of the amount accrued as of   September 30, 2016  ,   $16,011,000   relates to our acquisition of North Carolina ALF Portfolio in January and June 2015,   $498,000   relates to our acquisition of Stockbridge GA MOB II and   $50,000   relates to our acquisition of King of Prussia PA MOB. Of the amount accrued as of   December 31, 2015  ,   $4,131,000   relates to our acquisition of North Carolina ALF Portfolio in January and June 2015,   $1,381,000   relates to our acquisition of Stockbridge GA MOB II and   $400,000   relates to our acquisition of King of Prussia PA MOB. 
  The estimated total amount of   $16,011,000   related to North Carolina ALF Portfolio will be paid based upon the computation in the lease agreement and receipt of notification   within three years after the applicable acquisition   date that the tenant has increased its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and rent cost, or EBITDAR, as defined in the lease agreement, for the preceding   three   months. There is   no   minimum required payment but the total maximum is capped at     $35,144,000   and is also limited by the tenant s ability to increase its EBITDAR. Any payment made will result in an increase in the monthly rent charged to the tenant and additional rental revenue to us. Upon the tenant meeting certain conditions under the lease agreement and providing us notice in October 2016, we paid   $10,000,000   towards this obligation related to the Wake Forest Facility in November 2016. We have assumed that the tenant will meet the remaining conditions under the lease agreement and that we will pay the remaining contingent consideration for the three other facilities three years from the date of the applicable acquisition. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have accrued   $498,000   related to Stockbridge GA MOB II, and such consideration will be paid within   18 months   of the acquisition date based on the seller s leasing of one or both unoccupied spaces and achieving certain lease criteria. The payment of such consideration will occur after a qualified tenant delivers an estoppel, has taken occupancy and has begun paying rent under the new lease. The range of payment is   $0   up to no limit and and we have assumed that the seller will lease both of the unoccupied spaces within the specified time frame.  
  Warrants 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we have recorded   $960,000   and   $1,014,000  , respectively, related to warrants in Trilogy common units held by certain members of Trilogy s pre-closing management, which is included in security deposits, prepaid rent and other liabilities in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Once exercised, these warrants have redemption features similar to the common units held by members of Trilogy s pre-closing management.     See Note 12, Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests  , for a further discussion. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value as the warrants were issued at fair value on December 1, 2015.   
  Unobservable Inputs and Reconciliation 
  The fair value of the contingent consideration is determined based on the facts and circumstances existing at each reporting date and the likelihood of the counterparty achieving the necessary conditions based on a probability weighted discounted cash flow analysis based, in part, on significant inputs which are not observable in the market. As a result, we have determined that our contingent consideration valuations are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Any changes in the fair value of our contingent consideration assets and obligations subsequent to their acquisition date valuations are charged to earnings. Gains and losses recognized on contingent consideration assets and obligations are included in acquisition related expenses in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

The following table shows quantitative information about unobservable inputs related to Level 3 fair value measurements used as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   for the contingent consideration obligations: 

___________ 
           (1) 
    Significant increases or decreases in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation or in the aggregate would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement to the contingent consideration obligation as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
              (2) 
    The most significant input to the valuation is the tenant s annualized EBITDAR, as defined in the lease agreement. An increase (decrease) in the tenant s annualized EBITDAR would increase (decrease) the fair value. 
              (3) 
    An increase (decrease) in the leasing commissions to be paid would increase (decrease) the fair value. 
              (4) 
    The most significant input to the valuation is the percentage of total unoccupied square footage leased up. An increase (decrease) in the percentage of total unoccupied square footage leased up would increase (decrease) the fair value. An increase (decrease) in the tenant improvement allowance per square foot would decrease (increase) the fair value. An increase (decrease) in initial base rent would increase (decrease) the fair value.

The following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of our contingent consideration assets and obligations for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  :  

Financial Instruments Disclosed at Fair Value 
  ASC Topic 825,   Financial Instruments,   requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments, whether or not recognized on the face of the balance sheet. Fair value is defined under ASC Topic 820. 
  Our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets include the following financial instruments: real estate notes receivable, debt security investment, cash and cash equivalents, accounts and other receivables, restricted cash, real estate deposits, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, accounts payable due to affiliates, mortgage loans payable and borrowings under our lines of credit and term loan. 
  We consider the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts and other receivables, restricted cash, real estate deposits and accounts payable and accrued liabilities to approximate the fair value for these financial instruments based upon an evaluation of the underlying characteristics, market data and because of the short period of time between origination of the instruments and their expected realization. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of accounts payable due to affiliates is not determinable due to the related party nature of the accounts payable. The fair value of the other financial instruments is classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The fair value of our real estate notes receivable and debt security investment are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates available to us for investments with similar terms and maturities. The fair value of the mortgage loans payable and our lines of credit and term loan are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis using borrowing rates available to us for debt instruments with similar terms and maturities. We have determined that the valuations of our real estate notes receivable, debt security investment, mortgage loans payable and lines of credit and term loan are classified in Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of such financial instruments were as follows: 

16. Income Taxes 
  As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. We have elected to treat certain of our consolidated subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, pursuant to the Code. TRSs may participate in services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs and are subject to federal and state income tax at regular corporate tax rates.  
  The components of loss before taxes for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows:   

  The components of income tax (benefit) expense for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows:    

Current Income Tax    
  Federal and state income taxes are generally a function of the level of income recognized by our TRSs. Foreign income taxes are generally a function of our income on our real estate and real estate-related investments located in the UK and Isle of Man.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)   (Continued) 

Deferred Taxes  
  Deferred income tax is generally a function of the period s temporary differences (primarily basis differences between tax and financial reporting for real estate assets and equity investments) and generation of tax net operating losses that may be realized in future periods depending on sufficient taxable income.  
  We apply the rules under ASC 740-10,   Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,   for uncertain tax positions using a  more likely than not  recognition threshold for tax positions. Pursuant to these rules, we will initially recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of the tax position, that such a position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant tax authorities. If the tax benefit meets the  more likely than not  threshold, the measurement of the tax benefit will be based on our estimate of the ultimate tax benefit to be sustained if audited by the taxing authority. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we did not have any tax benefits or liabilities for uncertain tax positions that we believe should be recognized in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  We used estimated fair value for the preliminary allocation of consideration to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the Trilogy acquisition in December 2015. During this quarter, we obtained additional information that required revisions to the preliminary purchase price allocation. Specifically, the basis differences between tax and book were updated, and as a result, a deferred tax liability was recorded. The primary driver of this difference was the use of bonus depreciation for tax purposes.   See Note 17, Business Combinations  , for a further discussion. 
  The additional information obtained also impacted our allocation of deferred tax assets. An election was filed to step up the tax basis of certain assets pursuant to section 743 of the Code, and additional book/tax basis differences were finalized related to the contribution of certain assets by Trilogy to its TRS subsidiary prior to our acquisition of Trilogy. The contribution was structured as a tax free contribution, pursuant to section 351 of the Code. Straight line rent basis differences and net operating losses contributed to the growth in the deferred tax asset account in 2016. 
  We assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance is established if we believe it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are not realizable. As of   September 30, 2016  , our valuation allowance substantially reserves the net deferred tax asset due to inherent uncertainty of future income. We will continue to monitor industry and economic conditions, and our ability to generate taxable income based on our business plan and available tax planning strategies, which would allow us to utilize the tax benefits of the net deferred tax assets and thereby allow us to reverse all, or a portion of, our valuation allowance in the future.  
   
  17. Business Combinations    
  Trilogy Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation 
  We utilized estimated fair values for the preliminary allocation of consideration to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the acquisition of Trilogy in December 2015. As we continue to integrate Trilogy, we may obtain additional information on the acquired assets and assumed liabilities which, if significant, could require revisions to the preliminary purchase price allocation for Trilogy. Amounts for certain income tax accounts are also subject to change pending the filing of Trilogy s pre-acquisition tax returns and the receipt of information from taxing authorities, which, if significant, could require revisions to preliminary assumptions and estimates. If we determine that any measurement period adjustments are significant, we will recognize those adjustments, including any related impacts to deferred tax positions, goodwill or net income, in the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined.

  ___________ 
           (1)  
    Trilogy's assets acquired and liabilities assumed are consolidated and reported at   100%  . At the time of acquisition, we owned approximately   67.6%   of the net assets acquired. 
     During the third quarter of 2016, we updated the purchase price allocation of Trilogy to adjust deferred income tax liabilities as of the Trilogy acquisition date for pre-merger Trilogy s federal income tax returns and revised estimates. This measurement period adjustment was reflected in the table above as an increase to goodwill of   $7,699,000  , with corresponding adjustments to deferred income tax liabilities, which is included in security deposits, prepaid rent and other liabilities, in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. There is no impact to our condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and previously reported interim periods ended June 30, 2016 relating to this purchase price allocation adjustment.  
  2016 Business Combinations 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , using cash on hand and debt financing, we completed   11   property acquisitions comprising   17   buildings, which have been accounted for as business combinations. The aggregate contract purchase price for these property acquisitions was   $437,025,000  , plus closing costs, and acquisition fees of   $11,775,000  , which are included in acquisition related expenses in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.   See Note 3, Real Estate Investments, Net  , for a listing of the properties acquired, acquisition dates and the amount of financing initially incurred in connection with such acquisitions.  
  Results of operations for the property acquisitions during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   are reflected in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the period from the date of acquisition of each property through   September 30, 2016  . For the period from the acquisition date through   September 30, 2016  , we recognized the following amounts of revenue and net income for the property acquisitions:

The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed since October 1, 2015 were preliminary estimates determined using the income, cost and market approaches. Any necessary adjustments will be finalized within one year from the date of acquisition. The following table summarizes the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of our   11   property acquisitions in 2016: 

Assuming the property acquisitions in 2016 discussed above had occurred on January 1, 2015, for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , unaudited pro forma revenue, net loss, net loss attributable to controlling interest and net loss per common share attributable to controlling interest   basic and diluted would have been as follows: 

The unaudited pro forma adjustments assume that the offering proceeds, at a price of   $10.00   per share, net of offering costs, were raised as of January 1, 2015. In addition, acquisition related expenses associated with the acquisitions have been excluded from the pro forma results in 2016 and added to the 2015 pro forma results. The pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have been obtained had the acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the periods presented, nor are they necessarily indicative of future operating results. 
  2015 Business Combinations 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , using net proceeds from our initial offering and the assumption of mortgage loans payable, we completed   19   property acquisitions comprising   45   buildings, which have been accounted for as business combinations. The aggregate contract purchase price for these property acquisitions was   $763,367,000  , plus closing costs, and acquisition fees of   $25,338,000  , which are included in acquisition related expenses in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

The pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have been obtained had the acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the periods presented, nor are they necessarily indicative of future operating results. 
   
  18. Segment Reporting    
  ASC Topic 280,   Segment Reporting  , establishes standards for reporting financial and descriptive information about a public entity s reportable segments. As of   September 30, 2016  , we evaluated our business and made resource allocations based on   six   reportable business segments: medical office buildings, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, senior housing, senior housing       RIDEA and integrated senior health campuses. We segregate our operations into reporting segments in order to assess the performance of our business in the same way that management reviews our performance and makes operating decisions. Accordingly, when we acquired our first medical office building in June 2014; senior housing facility in September 2014; hospital in December 2014; senior housing   RIDEA portfolio in May 2015; skilled nursing facilities in October 2015; and integrated senior health campuses in December 2015, we added a new reportable business segment at such time.  
  Our medical office buildings are typically leased to multiple tenants under separate leases in each building, thus requiring active management and responsibility for many of the associated operating expenses (although many of these are, or can effectively be, passed through to the tenants). In addition, our medical office buildings segment includes the Mezzanine Notes. Our hospital investments are primarily single-tenant properties that lease the facilities to unaffiliated tenants under triple-net and generally master leases that transfer the obligation for all facility operating costs (including maintenance, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures) to the tenant. Our skilled nursing facilities and senior housing facilities are similarly structured as our hospital investments. In addition, our senior housing segment includes Crown Senior Care Facility and our debt security investment. Our senior housing       RIDEA properties include senior housing facilities that are owned and operated utilizing a RIDEA structure. Our integrated senior health campuses include a range of assisted living, memory care, independent living, skilled nursing services and certain ancillary businesses. 
  We evaluate performance based upon segment net operating income. We define segment net operating income as total revenues, less property operating expenses and rental expenses, which excludes depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, acquisition related expenses, interest expense, foreign currency gain (loss), interest and other income, loss from unconsolidated entities and income tax benefit (expense) for each segment. We believe that net income (loss), as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measurement. However, we believe that segment net operating income serves as a useful supplement to net income (loss) because it allows investors and our management to measure unlevered property-level operating results and to compare our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis.  
  Interest expense, depreciation and amortization and other expenses not attributable to individual properties are not allocated to individual segments for purposes of assessing segment performance. Non-segment assets primarily consist of corporate assets including cash and cash equivalents, real estate deposits, deferred financing costs, other receivables and other assets not attributable to individual properties.

Our portfolio of properties and other investments are located in the United States, Isle of Man and the UK. Revenues and assets are attributed to the country in which the property is physically located. The following is a summary of geographic information for our operations for the periods presented: 

19. Concentration of Credit Risk 
  Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk are primarily real estate notes receivable and debt security investment, cash and cash equivalents, accounts and other receivables, restricted cash and real estate deposits. We are exposed to credit risk with respect to the real estate notes receivable and debt security investment, but we believe collection of the outstanding amount is probable. We believe that the risk is further mitigated as the real estate notes receivable are secured by property and there is a guarantee of completion agreement executed between the parent company of the borrowers and us. Cash and cash equivalents are generally invested in investment-grade, short-term instruments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased. We have cash and cash equivalents in financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had cash and cash equivalents in excess of FDIC insured limits. We believe this risk is not significant. Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable from tenants is limited. We perform credit evaluations of prospective tenants and security deposits are obtained at the time of property acquisition and upon lease execution. 
  Based on leases in effect as of   September 30, 2016  ,   one   state in the United States accounted for   10.0%   or more of the annualized base rent of our total property portfolio. Properties located in Indiana accounted for   37.8%   of the annualized base rent of our total property portfolio. Accordingly, there is a geographic concentration of risk subject to fluctuations in such state s economy. 
  Based on leases in effect as of   September 30, 2016  , our   six   reportable business segments, integrated senior health campuses, medical office buildings, senior housing       RIDEA, senior housing, skilled nursing facilities and hospitals, accounted for   47.3%  ,   31.3%  ,   11.2%  ,   5.1%  ,   5.1%   and   0.0%  , respectively, of our annualized base rent. As of   September 30, 2016  , none of our tenants at our properties accounted for   10.0%   or more of our aggregate annualized base rent, which is based on contractual base rent from leases in effect inclusive of our senior housing   RIDEA facilities and integrated senior health campuses operations as of   September 30, 2016  .

20. Per Share Data    
  We report earnings (loss) per share pursuant to ASC Topic 260,   Earnings per Share  . Basic earnings (loss) per share for all periods presented are computed by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common stock by the weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding during the period. Net income (loss) applicable to common stock is calculated as net income (loss) attributable to controlling interest less distributions allocated to participating securities of   $6,000   and   $2,000  , respectively, for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   $12,000   and   $6,000  , respectively, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Diluted earnings (loss) per share are computed based on the weighted average number of shares of our common stock and all potentially dilutive securities, if any. Nonvested shares of our restricted common stock and redeemable limited partnership units of our operating partnership are participating securities and give rise to potentially dilutive shares of our common stock. As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were   40,000   and   22,000   nonvested shares, respectively, of our restricted common stock outstanding, but such shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because such shares were anti-dilutive during these periods. As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were   222   units of redeemable limited partnership units of our operating partnership outstanding, but such units were also excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because such units were anti-dilutive during these periods. 
   
  21. Subsequent Events 
  Property Acquisition 
  Subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , we completed the acquisition of   one   building from an unaffiliated party, which we added to our existing Fox Grape SNF Portfolio. The aggregate contract purchase price of this acquisition was   $22,500,000   and we paid   $506,000   in acquisition fees to our advisor in connection with this acquisition. We have not yet measured the fair value of the tangible and identified intangible assets and liabilities nor the proforma results of the acquisition. The following is a summary of our acquisition subsequent to   September 30, 2016  : 
   
 ___________ 
            (2) 
    Represents the principal balance of the mortgage loan payable placed on the property at the time of acquisition. 
              (3) 
    Represents borrowings under the 2016 Corporate Line of Credit at the time of acquisition. 
              (4) 
    Our advisor was paid in cash, as compensation for services rendered in connection with the investigation, selection and acquisition of our properties, an acquisition fee of   2.25%   of the contract purchase price of the property. 
              (5) 
    On November 1, 2016, we added one additional facility to our existing Fox Grape SNF Portfolio. The other   five   facilities were acquired in July 2016. 
     Amended and Restated Distribution Reinvestment Plan Price 
  Effective October 5, 2016, the Amended and Restated DRIP amended the price at which shares of our common stock will be issued pursuant to the Secondary DRIP Offering. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated DRIP, shares are issued at a price equal to the most recently estimated value of one share of our common stock, as     approved and established by our board. The Amended and Restated DRIP became effective with the distribution payment to stockholders paid in the month of November 2016, which distributions were reinvested at   $9.01   per share, the estimated per share net asset value, or NAV, unanimously approved and established by our board on October 5, 2016. Formerly, shares were issued pursuant to the Secondary DRIP Offering at   95.0%   of the estimated value of one share of our common stock, as estimated by our board. In all other material respects, the terms of the Secondary DRIP Offering remain unchanged by the Amended and Restated DRIP. 
  Amended and Restated Share Repurchase Plan 
  Effective October 5, 2016, we amended and restated our share repurchase plan. The Amended and Restated Share Repurchase Plan, which will take effect with respect to share repurchase requests submitted during the fourth quarter 2016, amends the price at which shares of our common stock will be repurchased pursuant to the share repurchase plan by amending

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)   (Continued) 

the definition of the term Repurchase Amount, as such term is used in the share repurchase plan. Upon effectiveness of the Amended and Restated Share Repurchase Plan, the Repurchase Amount that will be used to calculate the price at which shares will be repurchased will be the lesser of (i) the amount per share that a stockholder paid for their shares of our common stock or (ii) the most recent estimated value of one share of our common stock, as determined by our board, which was   $9.01   per share as unanimously approved and established by our board on October 5, 2016. Formerly, as a result of the termination of the Company s initial public offering of shares in April 2015, the Repurchase Amount was an amount determined by our board, in its discretion.  
  In addition, the Amended and Restated Share Repurchase Plan amends the price at which shares will be repurchased as a result of a stockholder s death or  qualifying disability , as defined in our share repurchase plan. Upon effectiveness of the Amended and Restated Share Repurchase Plan, shares repurchased in connection with a stockholder s death or qualifying disability will be repurchased at a price per share equal to   100%   of the Repurchase Amount. Formerly, shares repurchased in connection with a stockholder s death or qualifying disability were repurchased at   100%   of the price paid by the stockholder to acquire the shares of the Company s common stock. In all other material respects, the terms of the share repurchase plan remain unchanged by the Amended and Restated Share Repurchase Plan.

  Overview and Background 
  Griffin-American Healthcare REIT III, Inc., a Maryland corporation, was incorporated on   January 11, 2013  , and therefore we consider that our date of inception. We were initially capitalized on   January 15, 2013  . We invest in a diversified portfolio of real estate properties, focusing primarily on medical office buildings, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, senior housing and other healthcare-related facilities. We also operate healthcare-related facilities utilizing the structure permitted by the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007, which is commonly referred to as a  RIDEA  structure (the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, authorizing the RIDEA structure were enacted as part of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008). We also originate and acquire secured loans and real estate-related investments on an infrequent and opportunistic basis. We generally seek investments that produce current income. We qualified to be taxed as a REIT under the Code for federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended   December 31, 2014  , and we intend to continue to qualify to be taxed as a REIT.  
  On February 26, 2014, we commenced a best efforts initial public offering, or our initial offering, in which we initially offered to the public up to   $1,750,000,000   in shares of our common stock for   $10.00   per share in our primary offering and up to   $150,000,000   in shares of our common stock pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, or the DRIP, for   $9.50   per share, aggregating up to   $1,900,000,000  . We reserved the right to reallocate the shares of common stock we offered in our initial offering between the primary offering and the DRIP. As such, during our initial offering, we reallocated an aggregate of   $115,000,000   in shares from the DRIP to the primary offering. Accordingly, we offered to the public up to   $1,865,000,000   in shares of our common stock in our primary offering and up to   $35,000,000   in shares of our common stock pursuant to the DRIP. 
  On March 12, 2015, we terminated the primary portion of our initial offering. We continued to offer up to   $35,000,000   in shares of our common stock through our initial offering pursuant to the DRIP until the termination of the DRIP portion of our initial offering and deregistration of our initial offering on April 22, 2015. As of April 22, 2015, we had received and accepted subscriptions in our initial offering for   184,930,598   shares of our common stock, or   $1,842,618,000  , excluding shares of our common stock issued pursuant to the DRIP. As of April 22, 2015, a total of   $18,511,000   in distributions were reinvested that resulted in   1,948,563   shares of our common stock being issued pursuant to the DRIP.

     Table of Contents  

On March 25, 2015, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, to register a maximum of   $250,000,000   of additional shares of our common stock pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, or the Secondary DRIP Offering. The Registration Statement on Form S-3 was automatically effective with the SEC upon its filing; however, we did not commence offering shares pursuant to the Secondary DRIP Offering until April 22, 2015, following the deregistration of our initial offering. Effective October 5, 2016, we amended and restated the DRIP, or the Amended and Restated DRIP, to amend the price at which shares of our common stock are issued pursuant to the Secondary DRIP Offering.   See Note 21, Subsequent Events     Amended and Restated Distribution Reinvestment Plan Price, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for a further discussion. As of   September 30, 2016  , a total of   $92,250,000   in distributions were reinvested and   9,709,538   shares of our common stock were issued pursuant to the Secondary DRIP Offering. 
  On October 5, 2016, our board of directors, or our board, at the recommendation of the audit committee of our board, comprised solely of independent directors, unanimously approved and established an estimated per share net asset value, or NAV, of our common stock of $9.01. We are providing this estimated per share NAV to assist broker-dealers in connection with their obligations under National Association of Securities Dealers Conduct Rule 2340, as required by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, with respect to customer account statements. The estimated per share NAV is based on the estimated value of our assets less the estimated value of our liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis, calculated as of June 30, 2016. This valuation was performed in accordance with the methodology provided in Practice Guideline 2013-01,   Valuations of Publicly Registered Non-Listed REITs  , issued by the Investment Program Association, or the IPA, in April 2013, in addition to guidance from the SEC. Going forward, we intend to publish an updated estimated per share NAV on at least an annual basis. See our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 7, 2016, for more information on the methodologies and assumptions used to determine, and the limitations and risks of, our estimated per share NAV. 
  We conduct substantially all of our operations through Griffin-American Healthcare REIT III Holdings, LP, or our operating partnership. We are externally advised by Griffin-American Healthcare REIT III Advisor, LLC, or Griffin-American Advisor, or our advisor, pursuant to an advisory agreement, or the Advisory Agreement, between us and our advisor. The Advisory Agreement was effective as of February 26, 2014 and had a   one  -year term, but was subject to successive   one  -year renewals upon the mutual consent of the parties. The Advisory Agreement was renewed pursuant to the mutual consent of the parties on February 25, 2016 and expires on February 26, 2017. Our advisor uses its best efforts, subject to the oversight, review and approval of our board, to, among other things, research, identify, review and make investments in and dispositions of properties and securities on our behalf consistent with our investment policies and objectives. Our advisor performs its duties and responsibilities under the Advisory Agreement as our fiduciary. Our advisor is   75.0%   owned and managed by American Healthcare Investors, and   25.0%   owned by a wholly owned subsidiary of Griffin Capital. Effective March 1, 2015, American Healthcare Investors is   47.1%   owned by AHI Group Holdings, LLC (formerly known as American Healthcare Investors LLC), or AHI Group Holdings,   45.1%   indirectly owned by NorthStar Asset Management Group, Inc. (NYSE: NSAM), or NSAM, and   7.8%   owned by James F. Flaherty III, one of NSAM s partners. NSAM has announced its intention to merge with Colony Capital, Inc. (NYSE: CLNY) and NorthStar Realty Finance Corp. (NYSE: NRF) to form a new combined company, Colony NorthStar, Inc. The proposed merger is subject to substantial closing conditions, including the required approval from each respective company s stockholders, governmental and regulatory agencies and third parties. We are not affiliated with Griffin Capital, Griffin Capital Securities, LLC, or our dealer manager, NSAM, Mr. Flaherty, Colony Capital, Inc. or NorthStar Realty Finance Corp.; however, we are affiliated with Griffin-American Advisor, American Healthcare Investors and AHI Group Holdings. 
  We currently operate through   six   reportable business segments: medical office buildings, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, senior housing, senior housing   RIDEA and integrated senior health campuses. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had completed   47   real estate acquisitions whereby we owned and/or operated   88   properties, comprising   91   buildings, and   102   integrated senior health campuses including completed development projects, or approximately   11,880,000   square feet of gross leasable area, or GLA, for an aggregate contract purchase price of   $2,695,600,000  . In addition, as of   September 30, 2016  , we had acquired real estate-related investments for an aggregate purchase price of   $144,176,000  . As of September 30, 2016, our portfolio capitalization rate was approximately 7.41%, which estimate was based upon total property portfolio net operating income from each property s forward looking pro forma projections for the expected year one property performance, including any contractual rent increases contained in such leases for year one, divided by the purchase price of the total property portfolio, exclusive of any acquisition fees and expenses paid.

Interim Unaudited Financial Data 
  Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by us in accordance with GAAP in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the SEC. Certain information and footnote disclosures required for annual financial statements have been condensed or excluded pursuant to SEC rules and regulations. Accordingly, our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are, in our view, of a normal recurring nature and necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim period. Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year; such full year results may be less favorable. Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016.

  Factors Which May Influence Results of Operations 
  We are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, other than national economic conditions affecting real estate generally, that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact, favorable or unfavorable, on revenues or income from the acquisition, management and operation of properties other than those listed in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and those Risk Factors previously disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016. 
  Revenue 
  The amount of revenue generated by our properties and residents depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space and space available from lease terminations at the then existing rental rates. Negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our revenue in future periods. 
  Scheduled Lease Expirations 
  Excluding our senior housing       RIDEA facilities and our integrated senior health campuses, as of   September 30, 2016  , our properties were   94.7%   leased and during the remainder of   2016  , 2.6% of the leased GLA is scheduled to expire. For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , our senior housing       RIDEA facilities and integrated senior health campuses were   85.5%   and   86.9%   leased, respectively. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , our senior housing       RIDEA facilities and integrated senior health campuses were   84.9%   and   87.7%   leased, respectively. Substantially all of our leases with residents at such properties are for a term of one year or less. Our leasing strategy focuses on negotiating renewals for leases scheduled to expire during the next twelve months. In the future, if we are unable to negotiate renewals, we will try to identify new tenants or collaborate with existing tenants who are seeking additional space to occupy.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our remaining weighted average lease term was 8.6 years, excluding our senior housing       RIDEA facilities and our integrated senior health campuses. 
   
  Results of Operations 
  Comparison of the Three and   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015    
  Our primary sources of revenue include rents and resident fees and services. Our primary expenses include property operating expenses and rental expenses. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we operated through   six   reportable business segments: medical office buildings, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, senior housing, senior housing   RIDEA and integrated senior health campuses. We segregate our operations into reporting segments in order to assess the performance of our business in the same way that management  
  
   54 

     Table of Contents  

reviews our performance and makes operating decisions. Accordingly, when we acquired our first medical office building in June 2014; senior housing facility in September 2014; hospital in December 2014; senior housing   RIDEA portfolio in May 2015; skilled nursing facilities in October 2015; and integrated senior health campuses in December 2015, we added a new reportable business segment at such time.  
  Except where otherwise noted, our change in results of operations is primarily due to owning   91   buildings and   102   integrated senior health campuses as of   September 30, 2016  , as compared to owning 69 buildings and no integrated senior health campuses as of   September 30, 2015  . As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we owned the following types of properties: 

___________ 
           (1) 
    For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the leased percentage for the resident units of our integrated senior health campuses was   86.9%   and   87.7%  , respectively. 
              (2) 
    For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the leased percentage for the resident units of our senior housing   RIDEA facilities was   85.5%   and   84.9%  , respectively. For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the leased percentage for the resident units of our senior housing   RIDEA facilities was 87.9% and 88.8%, respectively. 
              (3) 
    Leased percentage excludes our senior housing   RIDEA facilities and integrated senior health campuses. 
     Revenues 
  For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , resident fees and services consisted of rental fees related to resident leases, extended health care fees and other ancillary services. We did not own or operate any senior housing   RIDEA facilities prior to May 2015 and we did not own or operate any integrated senior health campuses prior to December 2015. For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , real estate revenue primarily consisted of base rent and expense recoveries.  
  Revenues by operating segment consisted of the following for the periods then ended:

     Table of Contents  

Property Operating Expenses and Rental Expenses 
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , property operating expenses primarily consisted of administration and benefits expense of $164,859,000 and $7,027,000, respectively. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , property operating expenses primarily consisted of administration and benefits expense of $491,437,000 and $8,316,000, respectively. 
  Property operating expenses and property operating expenses as a percentage of resident fees and services, as well as rental expenses and rental expenses as a percentage of real estate revenue, by operating segment consisted of the following for the periods then ended: 

Integrated senior health campuses and senior housing   RIDEA facilities typically have a higher percentage of operating expenses to revenue than multi-tenant medical office buildings, hospitals, senior housing facilities and skilled nursing facilities. We anticipate that the percentage of operating expenses to revenue will fluctuate based on the types of property we acquire in the future. 
  General and Administrative  
  General and administrative consisted of the following for the periods then ended:

     Table of Contents  

The increase in general and administrative for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015   was primarily the result of purchasing additional properties in 2016 and 2015 and thus incurring higher asset management fees to our advisor. We expect general and administrative to continue to increase in 2016 as we purchase additional properties and have a full year of operations. 
  Acquisition Related Expenses  
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , acquisition related expenses were   $15,936,000   and   $11,953,000  , respectively, and were related primarily to expenses associated with our   four   and five property acquisitions, respectively, including acquisition fees of   $3,524,000   and $3,566,000, respectively, incurred to our advisor and its affiliates. 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , acquisition related expenses were   $24,184,000   and   $34,628,000  , respectively, and were related primarily to expenses associated with our   13   and   19   property acquisitions, respectively, including acquisition fees of   $8,551,000   and $17,262,000, respectively, incurred to our advisor and its affiliates.  
  Depreciation and Amortization  
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , depreciation and amortization was   $71,384,000   and   $14,986,000  , respectively, and consisted primarily of depreciation on our operating properties of   $18,050,000   and $7,112,000, respectively, and amortization on our identified intangible assets of   $53,045,000   and $7,868,000, respectively. 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , depreciation and amortization was   $212,596,000   and   $27,794,000  , respectively, and consisted primarily of depreciation on our operating properties of   $49,719,000   and $15,433,000, respectively, and amortization on our identified intangible assets of   $162,090,000   and $12,354,000, respectively. 
  Interest Expense 
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , interest expense, including gain (loss) in fair value of derivative financial instruments, was   $12,038,000   and   $898,000  , respectively. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , interest expense, including gain (loss) in fair value of derivative financial instruments, was   $32,404,000   and   $1,855,000  , respectively. Interest expense consisted of the following for the periods then ended: 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our sources of funds primarily consist of operating cash flows and borrowings. We terminated the primary portion of our initial offering on March 12, 2015. In the normal course of business, our principal demands for funds are for our payment of operating expenses, interest on our current and future indebtedness and distributions to our stockholders and for acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related investments.  
  Our total capacity to pay operating expenses, interest and distributions and purchase real estate and real estate-related investments is a function of our current cash position, our borrowing capacity on our lines of credit, as well as any future indebtedness that we may incur. As of   September 30, 2016  , our cash on hand was   $37,147,000   and we had   $250,516,000   available on our lines of credit and term loan. We believe that these resources will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the foreseeable future, and we do not anticipate a need to raise funds from other sources within the next 12 months. 
  We estimate that we will require approximately $13,924,000 to pay interest on our outstanding indebtedness in the remainder of 2016, based on interest rates in effect as of   September 30, 2016  . In addition, we estimate that we will require $1,419,000 to pay principal on our outstanding indebtedness in the remainder of 2016. We also require resources to make certain payments to our advisor and its affiliates.   See Note 14, Related Party Transactions  , to our accompanying condensed  
  
   57 

     Table of Contents  

consolidated financial statements, for a further discussion of our payments to our advisor and their affiliates. Generally, cash needs for such items will be met from operations and borrowings.  
  Our advisor evaluates potential investments and engages in negotiations with real estate sellers, developers, brokers, investment managers, lenders and others on our behalf. When we acquire a property, our advisor prepares a capital plan that contemplates the estimated capital needs of that investment. In addition to operating expenses, capital needs may also include costs of refurbishment, tenant improvements or other major capital expenditures. The capital plan also sets forth the anticipated sources of the necessary capital, which may include a line of credit or other loans established with respect to the investment, operating cash generated by the investment, additional equity investments from us or joint venture partners or, when necessary, capital reserves. Any capital reserve would be established from proceeds from sales of other investments, borrowings, operating cash generated by other investments or other cash on hand. In some cases, a lender may require us to establish capital reserves for a particular investment. The capital plan for each investment will be adjusted through ongoing, regular reviews of our portfolio or as necessary to respond to unanticipated additional capital needs. 
  Other Liquidity Needs  
  In the event that there is a shortfall in net cash available due to various factors, including, without limitation, the timing of distributions or the timing of the collection of receivables, we may seek to obtain capital to pay distributions by means of secured or unsecured debt financing through one or more third parties, or our advisor or its affiliates. We may also pay distributions from cash from capital transactions, including, without limitation, the sale of one or more of our properties.  
  Based on the properties we owned as of   September 30, 2016  , we estimate that our expenditures for capital improvements and tenant improvements will require up to   $682,000   for the remaining three months of 2016. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $8,644,000   of restricted cash in loan impounds and reserve accounts for capital expenditures, some of which may be used to fund our estimated expenditures for capital improvements and tenant improvements. We cannot provide assurance, however, that we will not exceed these estimated expenditure and distribution levels or be able to obtain additional sources of financing on commercially favorable terms or at all.  
  If we experience lower occupancy levels, reduced rental rates, reduced revenues as a result of asset sales, or increased capital expenditures and leasing costs compared to historical levels due to competitive market conditions for new and renewed leases, the effect would be a reduction of net cash provided by operating activities. If such a reduction of net cash provided by operating activities is realized, we may have a cash flow deficit in subsequent periods. Our estimate of net cash available is based on various assumptions which are difficult to predict, including the levels of leasing activity and related leasing costs. Any changes in these assumptions could impact our financial results and our ability to fund working capital and unanticipated cash needs.  
  Cash Flows  
  The following table sets forth changes in cash flows:   

  The following summary discussion of our changes in our cash flows is based on our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below. 
  Operating Activities 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities related to the cash flows provided by our property operations, offset by the payment of acquisition related expenses and general and administrative expenses. See Results of Operations above for a further discussion. We anticipate cash flows from operating activities to increase as we purchase additional properties. 
  
   58 

     Table of Contents  

Investing Activities 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , cash flows used in investing activities primarily related to our   13   property acquisitions in the amount of   $277,949,000   and capital expenditures of   $30,441,000  . For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , cash flows used in investing activities related primarily to our   19   property acquisitions in the amount of   $675,794,000   and our acquisition of real estate notes receivables of   $81,805,000  . We may continue to acquire additional real estate and real estate-related investments, but generally anticipate that cash flows used in investing activities will decrease in 2016 as compared to 2015 due to fewer anticipated acquisitions as a result of the termination of the primary portion of our initial offering in March 2015. 
  Financing Activities 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , cash flows provided by financing activities primarily related to net borrowings under our revolving lines of credit and revolving term loan in the amount of   $259,484,000  , partially offset by distributions to our common stockholders of   $38,343,000   and share repurchases of   $14,833,000  . For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , cash flows provided by financing activities primarily related to funds raised from investors in our initial offering in the amount of   $975,121,000  , partially offset by the payment of offering costs of   $95,420,000   in connection with our initial offering, distributions to our common stockholders of   $31,666,000  , share repurchases of   $2,846,000   and the payment of deferred financing costs of $1,156,000. Overall, we anticipate cash flows from financing activities to decrease in the future since we terminated the primary portion of our initial offering on March 12, 2015. However, we anticipate borrowings under our lines of credit and term loan and other indebtedness to increase as we may acquire additional real estate and real estate-related investments.  
  Distributions 
  Our board has authorized, on a quarterly basis, a daily distribution to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on each day of the period commencing on May 14, 2014 and ending on December 31, 2016. The distributions were or will be calculated based on 365 days in the calendar year and are equal to $0.001643836 per share of our common stock, which is equal to an annualized distribution rate of 6.0%, assuming a purchase price of $10.00 per share. These daily distributions were or will be aggregated and paid monthly in arrears in cash or shares of our common stock pursuant to the DRIP and the Secondary DRIP Offering, only from legally available funds. 
  The amount of the distributions paid to our stockholders is determined quarterly by our board and is dependent on a number of factors, including funds available for payment of distributions, our financial condition, capital expenditure requirements and annual distribution requirements needed to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code. We did not establish any limit on the amount of offering proceeds that may be used to fund distributions, except that, in accordance with our organizational documents and Maryland law, we may not make distributions that would: (i) cause us to be unable to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or (ii) cause our total assets to be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus senior liquidation preferences. 
  The distributions paid for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , along with the amount of distributions reinvested pursuant to the DRIP and Secondary DRIP Offering, and the sources of our distributions as compared to cash flows from operations were as follows: 

Under GAAP, acquisition related expenses are expensed, and therefore, are subtracted from cash flows from operations. However, these expenses may be paid from offering proceeds or debt. 
  Our distributions of amounts in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits have resulted in a return of capital to our stockholders, and all or any portion of a distribution to our stockholders may be paid from offering proceeds. The  
  
   59 

     Table of Contents  

payment of distributions from our initial offering proceeds could reduce the amount of capital we ultimately invest in assets and negatively impact the amount of income available for future distributions. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had an amount payable of   $2,262,000   to our advisor or its affiliates primarily for asset and property management fees and acquisition fees, which will be paid from cash flows from operations in the future as it becomes due and payable by us in the ordinary course of business consistent with our past practice. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , no amounts due to our advisor or its affiliates had been deferred, waived or forgiven other than   $37,000   in asset management fees waived by our advisor in 2014, which was equal to the amount of distributions payable to our stockholders for the period from May 14, 2014, the date we received and accepted subscriptions aggregating at least the minimum offering of $2,000,000 required pursuant to our initial offering, through June 5, 2014, the date we acquired our first property. Our advisor did not receive any additional securities, shares of our stock, or any other form of consideration or any repayment as a result of the waiver of such asset management fees. Other than the waiver of such asset management fees by our advisor in order to provide us with additional funds to pay initial distributions to our stockholders through June 5, 2014, our advisor and its affiliates, including our co-sponsors, have no obligation to defer or forgive fees owed by us to our advisor or its affiliates or to advance any funds to us. In the future, if our advisor or its affiliates do not defer, waive or forgive amounts due to them, this would negatively affect our cash flows from operations, which could result in us paying distributions, or a portion thereof, using borrowed funds. As a result, the amount of proceeds from borrowings available for investment and operations would be reduced, or we may incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds. 
  The distributions paid for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , along with the amount of distributions reinvested pursuant to the DRIP and the Secondary DRIP Offering, and the sources of our distributions as compared to funds from operations attributable to controlling interest, or FFO, were as follows: 

The payment of distributions from sources other than FFO may reduce the amount of proceeds available for investment and operations or cause us to incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds. For a further discussion of FFO, a non-GAAP financial measure, including a reconciliation of our GAAP net loss to FFO, see Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations below. 
  Financing 
  We intend to continue to finance a portion of the purchase price of our investments in real estate and real estate-related investments by borrowing funds. We anticipate that our overall leverage will not exceed 45.0% of the combined market value of all of our properties and other real estate-related investments, as determined at the end of each calendar year beginning with our first full year of operations. For these purposes, the market value of each asset will be equal to the purchase price paid for the asset or, if the asset was appraised subsequent to the date of purchase, then the market value will be equal to the value reported in the most recent independent appraisal of the asset. Our policies do not limit the amount we may borrow with respect to any individual investment. As of   September 30, 2016  , our aggregate borrowings were 40.1% of the combined market value of all of our real estate and real estate-related investments. 
  Under our charter, we have a limitation on borrowing that precludes us from borrowing in excess of 300% of our net assets without the approval of a majority of our independent directors. Net assets for purposes of this calculation are defined to be our total assets (other than intangibles), valued at cost prior to deducting depreciation, amortization, bad debt and other non-cash reserves, less total liabilities. Generally, the preceding calculation is expected to approximate 75.0% of the aggregate cost of our real estate and real estate-related investments before depreciation, amortization, bad debt and other similar non-cash reserves. In addition, we may incur mortgage debt and pledge some or all of our real properties as security for that debt to obtain funds to acquire additional real estate or for working capital. We may also borrow funds to satisfy the REIT tax qualification requirement that we distribute at least 90.0% of our annual taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to our  
  
   60 

     Table of Contents  

stockholders. Furthermore, we may borrow if we otherwise deem it necessary or advisable to ensure that we qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. As of   November 14, 2016   and   September 30, 2016  , our leverage did not exceed 300% of the value of our net assets. 
  Mortgage Loans Payable, Net 
  For a discussion of our mortgage loans payable, net,   see Note 7, Mortgage Loans Payable, Net  , to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Lines of Credit and Term Loan 
  For a discussion of our lines of credit and term loan,   see Note 8, Lines of Credit and Term Loan  , to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  REIT Requirements 
  In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we are required to make distributions to our stockholders of at least 90.0% of our annual taxable income, excluding net capital gains. In the event that there is a shortfall in net cash available due to factors including, without limitation, the timing of such distributions or the timing of the collection of receivables, we may seek to obtain capital to pay distributions by means of secured and unsecured debt financing through one or more unaffiliated parties. We may also pay distributions from cash from capital transactions including, without limitation, the sale of one or more of our properties or from the proceeds of our initial offering. 
  Commitments and Contingencies 
  For a discussion of our commitments and contingencies,   see Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies  , to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Debt Service Requirements 
  Our principal liquidity need is the payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $502,222,000   (  $482,966,000  , including discount/premium and deferred financing costs, net) of fixed-rate and variable-rate mortgage loans payable outstanding secured by our properties. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $609,484,000   outstanding and   $250,516,000   remained available under our lines of credit and term loan.   See Note 8, Lines of Credit and Term Loan  , to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  We are required by the terms of certain loan documents to meet certain covenants, such as leverage ratios, net worth ratios, debt service coverage ratios, fixed charge coverage ratios and reporting requirements. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all such covenants and requirements on our mortgage loans payable and our lines of credit and term loan. As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average effective interest rate on our outstanding debt, factoring in our fixed-rate interest rate swaps and interest rate cap, was   3.93%   per annum.

Contractual Obligations 
  The following table provides information with respect to: (i) the maturity and scheduled principal repayment of our secured mortgage loans payable and our lines of credit and term loan; (ii) interest payments on our mortgage loans payable, lines of credit and term loan and fixed interest rate swaps and interest rate cap; and (iii) ground and other lease obligations and capital leases as of   September 30, 2016  : 

The table above does not reflect any payments expected under our contingent consideration obligations in the estimated amount of   $16,559,000  , the majority of which we expect to pay within the first six months in 2018. For a further discussion of our contingent consideration obligations,   see Note 15, Fair Value Measurements     Assets and Liabilities Reported at Fair Value   Contingent Consideration, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no off-balance sheet transactions, nor do we currently have any such arrangements or obligations. 
  Inflation 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , inflation has not significantly affected our operations because of the moderate inflation rate; however, we expect to be exposed to inflation risk as income from future long-term leases will be the primary source of our cash flows from operations. There are provisions in the majority of our tenant leases that will protect us from the impact of inflation. These provisions will include negotiated rental increases, reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, and real estate tax and insurance reimbursements on a per square foot allowance. However, due to the long-term nature of the anticipated leases, among other factors, the leases may not re-set frequently enough to cover inflation.  
  Related Party Transactions 
  For a discussion of related party transactions,   see Note 14, Related Party Transactions  , to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations 
  Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, an industry trade group, has promulgated a measure known as funds from operations, which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. The use of funds from operations is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure, and our management uses FFO to evaluate our performance over time. FFO is not equivalent to our net income (loss) as determined under GAAP. 
  We define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on funds from operations approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004, or the White Paper. The White Paper defines funds from operations as net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property and asset impairment writedowns, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect funds from operations. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT s policy described above.

The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, which is the case if such assets are not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant circumstances and/or as requested or required by lessees for operational purposes in order to maintain the value disclosed. We believe that, since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation may be less informative. In addition, we believe it is appropriate to exclude impairment charges, as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations and assessments regarding general market conditions, which can change over time. Testing for an impairment of an asset is a continuous process and is analyzed on a quarterly basis. If certain impairment indications exist in an asset, and if the asset s carrying, or book value, exceeds the total estimated undiscounted future cash flows (including net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP) from such asset, an impairment charge would be recognized. Investors should note, however, that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance, because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property and certain other ancillary cash flows, are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and that we intend to have a relatively limited term of our operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges through the eventual sale of the property. 
  Historical accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP. Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate-related depreciation and amortization and impairments, provides a further understanding of our performance to investors and to our management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income (loss). 
  However, FFO and modified funds from operations attributable to controlling interest, or MFFO, as described below, should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income (loss) or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP FFO and MFFO measures and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO. 
  Changes in the accounting and reporting rules under GAAP that were put into effect and other changes to GAAP accounting for real estate subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT s definition of FFO have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition fees and expenses, as items that are expensed as operating expenses under GAAP. We believe these fees and expenses do not affect our overall long-term operating performance. Publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation. While other start up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, we believe that publicly registered, non-listed REITs are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases. We have used the proceeds raised in our initial offering to acquire properties, and we intend to begin the process of achieving a liquidity event (i.e., listing of our shares of common stock on a national securities exchange, a merger or sale, the sale of all or substantially all of our assets or another similar transaction) within five years after the completion of our offering stage, which is generally comparable to other publicly registered, non-listed REITs. Thus, we do not intend to continuously purchase assets and intend to have a limited life. Due to the above factors and other unique features of publicly registered, non-listed REITs, the IPA, an industry trade group, has standardized a measure known as modified funds from operations, which the IPA has recommended as a supplemental measure for publicly registered, non-listed REITs and which we believe to be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a publicly registered, non-listed REIT having the characteristics described above. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income (loss) as determined under GAAP, and MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate with a limited life and targeted exit strategy, as currently intended. We believe that, because MFFO excludes acquisition fees and expenses that affect our operations only in periods in which properties are acquired and that we consider more reflective of investing activities, as well as other non-operating items included in FFO, MFFO can provide, on a going forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of our operating performance after the period in which we are acquiring our properties and once our portfolio is in place. By providing MFFO, we believe we are presenting useful information that assists investors and analysts to better assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our offering stage has been completed and our properties have been acquired. We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the publicly registered, non-listed REIT industry. Further, we believe MFFO is useful in comparing the sustainability of our operating

performance after our offering stage and acquisitions are completed with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies that are not as involved in acquisition activities. Investors are cautioned that MFFO should only be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our offering stage has been completed and properties have been acquired, as it excludes acquisition fees and expenses that have a negative effect on our operating performance during the periods in which properties are acquired. 
  We define MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the IPA s Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations, or the Practice Guideline, issued by the IPA in November 2010. The Practice Guideline defines modified funds from operations as funds from operations further adjusted for the following items included in the determination of GAAP net income (loss): acquisition fees and expenses; amounts relating to deferred rent receivables and amortization of above- and below-market leases and liabilities (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to closer to an expected to be received cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments); accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income (loss); gains or losses included in net income (loss) from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan; unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting; and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect modified funds from operations on the same basis. The accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments, unrealized gains and losses on hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings, unrealized gains and losses resulting from consolidations, as well as other listed cash flow adjustments are adjustments made to net income (loss) in calculating cash flows from operations and, in some cases, reflect gains or losses which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized. We are responsible for managing interest rate, hedge and foreign exchange risk, and we do not rely on another party to manage such risk. Inasmuch as interest rate hedges will not be a fundamental part of our operations, we believe it is appropriate to exclude such gains and losses in calculating MFFO, as such gains and losses are based on market fluctuations and may not be directly related or attributable to our operations. 
  Our MFFO calculation complies with the IPA s Practice Guideline described above. In calculating MFFO, we exclude acquisition related expenses (which include gains and losses on contingent consideration), amortization of above- and below-market leases, amortization of loan and closing costs, change in deferred rent receivables, fair value adjustments of derivative financial instruments, gains or losses on foreign currency transactions and the adjustments of such items related to unconsolidated properties and noncontrolling interests. The other adjustments included in the IPA s Practice Guideline are not applicable to us for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Acquisition fees and expenses are paid in cash by us, and we have not set aside cash on hand to be used to fund acquisition fees and expenses. The purchase of real estate and real estate-related investments, and the corresponding expenses associated with that process, is a key operational feature of our business plan in order to generate operating revenues and cash flows to make distributions to our stockholders. However, we do not intend to fund acquisition fees and expenses in the future from operating revenues and cash flows, nor from the sale of properties and subsequent redeployment of capital and concurrent incurring of acquisition fees and expenses. Acquisition fees and expenses include payments to our advisor or its affiliates and third parties. Such fees and expenses will not be reimbursed by our advisor or its affiliates and third parties, and therefore if there are no further proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock to fund future acquisition fees and expenses, such fees and expenses will need to be paid from either additional debt, operational earnings or cash flows, net proceeds from the sale of properties, or from ancillary cash flows. Certain acquisition related expenses under GAAP are considered operating expenses and as expenses included in the determination of net income (loss) and income (loss) from continuing operations, both of which are performance measures under GAAP. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property. In the future, we may pay acquisition fees or reimburse acquisition expenses due to our advisor and its affiliates, or a portion thereof, with net proceeds from borrowed funds, operational earnings or cash flows, net proceeds from the sale of properties or ancillary cash flows. As a result, the amount of proceeds from borrowings available for investment and operations would be reduced, or we may incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds. Nevertheless, our advisor or its affiliates will not accrue any claim on our assets if acquisition fees and expenses are not paid from cash on hand. 
  Further, under GAAP, certain contemplated non-cash fair value and other non-cash adjustments are considered operating non-cash adjustments to net income (loss) in determining cash flows from operations. In addition, we view fair value adjustments of derivatives and gains and losses from dispositions of assets as items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized or as items which are not reflective of on-going operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance. 
  Our management uses MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it in order to evaluate our performance against other publicly registered, non-listed REITs which intend to have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted  
  
   64 

     Table of Contents  

exit strategies shortly thereafter. As noted above, MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance if we do not continue to operate in this manner. We believe that our use of MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it allow us to present our performance in a manner that reflects certain characteristics that are unique to publicly registered, non-listed REITs, such as their limited life, limited and defined acquisition period and targeted exit strategy, and hence, that the use of such measures may be useful to investors. For example, acquisition fees and expenses are intended to be funded from the proceeds of our initial offering and other financing sources and not from operations. By excluding expensed acquisition fees and expenses, the use of MFFO provides information consistent with management s analysis of the operating performance of the properties. Additionally, fair value adjustments, which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions, but can also result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates, may not be directly related or attributable to our current operating performance. By excluding such charges that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gains or losses, we believe MFFO provides useful supplemental information. 
  Presentation of this information is intended to provide useful information to investors as they compare the operating performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate funds from operations and modified funds from operations the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations, which is an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other measurements as an indication of our performance. MFFO may be useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability of operating performance in future operating periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition stages are complete and net asset value is disclosed. FFO and MFFO are not useful measures in evaluating net asset value because impairments are taken into account in determining net asset value but not in determining FFO and MFFO. 
  Neither the SEC, NAREIT nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate funds from operations or modified funds from operations. In the future, the SEC, NAREIT or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the publicly registered, non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO.

The following is a reconciliation of net loss, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to FFO and MFFO for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

___________ 
           (1) 
    In evaluating investments in real estate, we differentiate the costs to acquire the investment from the operations derived from the investment. Such information would be comparable only for publicly registered, non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activity and have other similar operating characteristics. By excluding expensed acquisition related expenses, we believe MFFO provides useful supplemental information that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management s analysis of the investing and operating performance of our properties. Acquisition fees and expenses include payments to our advisor or its affiliates and third parties. Acquisition related expenses under GAAP are considered operating expenses and as expenses included in the determination of net income (loss) and income (loss) from continuing operations, both of which are performance measures under GAAP. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property. 
       
           (2) 
    Under GAAP, above- and below-market leases are assumed to diminish predictably in value over time and amortized, similar to depreciation and amortization of other real estate-related assets that are excluded from FFO. However, because real estate values and market lease rates historically rise or fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates,  
     
   66 

     Table of Contents  

the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, we believe that by excluding charges relating to the amortization of above- and below-market leases, MFFO may provide useful supplemental information on the performance of the real estate. 
    
           (3) 
    Under GAAP, direct loan and closing costs are amortized over the term of our notes receivable and debt security investment as an adjustment to the yield on our notes receivable or debt security investment. This may result in income recognition that is different than the contractual cash flows under our notes receivable and debt security investment. By adjusting for the amortization of the loan and closing costs related to our real estate notes receivable and debt security investment, MFFO may provide useful supplemental information on the realized economic impact of our notes receivable and debt security investment terms, providing insight on the expected contractual cash flows of such notes receivable and debt security investment, and aligns results with our analysis of operating performance. 
       
           (4) 
    Under GAAP, rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related lease (including rent holidays). This may result in income recognition that is significantly different than the underlying contract terms. By adjusting for the change in deferred rent receivables, MFFO may provide useful supplemental information on the realized economic impact of lease terms, providing insight on the expected contractual cash flows of such lease terms, and aligns results with our analysis of operating performance. 
       
           (5) 
    Under GAAP, we are required to record our derivative financial instruments at fair value at each reporting period. We believe that adjusting for the change in fair value of our derivative financial instruments is appropriate because such adjustments may not be reflective of on-going operations and reflect unrealized impacts on value based only on then current market conditions, although they may be based upon general market conditions. The need to reflect the change in fair value of our derivative financial instruments is a continuous process and is analyzed on a quarterly basis in accordance with GAAP. 
       
           (6) 
    We believe that adjusting for the change in foreign currency exchange rates provides useful information because such adjustments may not be reflective of on-going operations. 
       
           (7) 
    Includes all adjustments to eliminate the unconsolidated properties  share or redeemable noncontrolling interests and noncontrolling interests  share, as applicable, of the adjustments described in Notes (1)       (6) to convert our FFO to MFFO. 
     Net Operating Income 
  Net operating income, or NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, generated from properties before general and administrative expenses, acquisition related expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, foreign currency loss, interest and other income, loss from unconsolidated entities and income tax expense. Acquisition fees and expenses are paid in cash by us, and we have not set aside cash on hand to be used to fund acquisition fees and expenses. The purchase of real estate and real estate-related investments, and the corresponding expenses associated with that process, is a key operational feature of our business plan in order to generate operating revenues and cash flows to make distributions to our stockholders. Acquisition fees and expenses include payments to our advisor or its affiliates and third parties. Such fees and expenses are not reimbursed by our advisor or its affiliates and third parties, and therefore if there is no further cash on hand to fund future acquisition fees and expenses, such fees and expenses will need to be paid from additional debt. As a result, the amount of proceeds available for investment, operations and non-operating expenses would be reduced, or we may incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds. Nevertheless, our advisor or its affiliates will not accrue any claim on our assets if acquisition fees and expenses are not paid from cash on hand. Acquisition related expenses under GAAP are considered operating expenses and as expenses included in the determination of net income (loss) and income (loss) from continuing operations, both of which are performance measures under GAAP. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property. 
  NOI is not equivalent to our net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as determined under GAAP and may not be a useful measure in measuring operational income or cash flows. Furthermore, NOI is not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations, which is an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. NOI should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income (loss) or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. Investors are also cautioned that  
  
   67 

     Table of Contents  

NOI should only be used to assess our operational performance in periods in which we have not incurred or accrued any acquisition related expenses. 
  We believe that NOI is useful for investors as it provides an accurate measure of the operating performance of our operating assets because NOI excludes certain items that are not associated with the management of the properties. We believe that NOI is a widely accepted measure of comparative operating performance in the real estate community. However, our use of the term NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as they may have different methodologies for computing this amount.  
  To facilitate understanding of this financial measure, the following is a reconciliation of net loss, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to NOI for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
  Market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. There were no material changes in our market risk exposures, or in the methods we use to manage market risk, from those that were provided for in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016, except that we are now exposed to interest rate risk on our derivative financial instruments as noted below. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  We are exposed to the effects of interest rate changes primarily as a result of long-term debt used to acquire properties and make loans and other permitted investments. We are also exposed to the effects of changes in interest rates as a result of our investments in real estate notes receivable. Our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings, prepayment penalties and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs while taking into account variable interest rate risk. To achieve our objectives, we may borrow or lend at fixed or variable rates.  
  We have entered into, and in the future may continue to enter into, derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and interest rate caps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument, and for which we have not and may not elect hedge accounting treatment. Because we have not elected to apply hedge accounting treatment to these derivatives, changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative financial instruments are recorded as a component of interest expense in loss in fair value of derivative financial instruments in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. As of   September 30, 2016  , our interest rate cap and interest rate swaps are recorded on our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets at their fair values of   $0   and   $39,000  , respectively. We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes.

     Table of Contents  

As of   September 30, 2016  , the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes. 

Real Estate Notes Receivable and Debt Security Investment, Net 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the carrying value of our real estate notes receivable and debt security investment, net was   $144,609,000  . As we expect to hold our fixed-rate notes receivable and debt security investment to maturity and the amounts due under such notes receivable and debt security investment would be limited to the outstanding principal balance and any accrued and unpaid interest, we do not expect that fluctuations in interest rates, and the resulting change in fair value of our fixed-rate notes receivable and debt security investment, would have a significant impact on our operations. Conversely, movements in interest rates on our variable-rate notes receivable may change our future earnings and cash flows, but not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments.   See Note 15, Fair Value Measurements  , to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, for a discussion of the fair value of our real estate notes receivable and our investment in a held-to-maturity debt security. 
  The weighted average effective interest rate on our outstanding real estate notes receivable and debt security investment, net was 5.32% per annum based on rates in effect as of   September 30, 2016  . A decrease in the variable interest rate on our real estate notes receivable constitutes a market risk. As of   September 30, 2016  , a 0.50% decrease in the market rates of interest would have no impact on our future earnings and cash flows due to interest rate floors on our variable-rate real estate notes receivable. 
  Mortgage Loans Payable, Net and Lines of Credit and Term Loan 
  Mortgage loans payable were   $502,222,000   (  $482,966,000  , including discount/premium and deferred financing costs, net) as of   September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   30   fixed-rate and   six   variable-rate mortgage loans payable with effective interest rates ranging from   2.45%   to   6.45%   per annum and a weighted average effective interest rate of   4.43%  . In addition, as of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $609,484,000   outstanding under our lines of credit and term loan, at a weighted-average interest rate of 3.41% per annum.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average effective interest rate on our outstanding debt, factoring in our fixed-rate interest rate swaps and interest rate cap, was   3.93%   per annum. An increase in the variable interest rate on our variable-rate mortgage loans payable and lines of credit and term loan constitutes a market risk. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have a fixed-rate interest rate cap on one of our variable-rate mortgage loans payable and   two   fixed-rate interest rate swaps on one of our lines of credit and term loan and an increase in the variable interest rate thereon would have no effect on our overall annual interest expense. As of   September 30, 2016  , a 0.50% increase in the market rates of interest would have increased our overall annualized interest expense on all of our other variable-rate mortgage loan payable and lines of credit and term loan by  
  
   69 

     Table of Contents  

$4,122,000, or 11.41% of total annualized interest expense on our mortgage loans payable and lines of credit and term loan.   See Note 7, Mortgage Loans Payable, Net  , and   Note 8, Lines of Credit and Term Loan  , to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.  
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
  Foreign currency exchange rate risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Based solely on our results for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , if foreign currency exchange rates were to increase or decrease by 1.00%, our net income from these investments would decrease or increase, as applicable, by approximately $22,000 for the same period. 
  Other Market Risk 
  In addition to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, the value of our future investments is subject to fluctuations based on changes in local and regional economic conditions and changes in the creditworthiness of tenants, which may affect our ability to refinance our debt if necessary. 
   
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
  (a)   Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.   We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to us, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and we necessarily are required to apply our judgment in evaluating whether the benefits of the controls and procedures that we adopt outweigh their costs. 
  As required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, an evaluation as of   September 30, 2016   was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of   September 30, 2016  , were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
  (b)   Changes in internal control over financial reporting.   There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

  Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
  The use of the words  we,   us  or  our  refers to Griffin-American Healthcare REIT III, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including Griffin-American Healthcare REIT III Holdings, LP, except where the context otherwise requires. 
  There were no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016, except as noted below. 
  We have not had sufficient cash available from operations to pay distributions, and therefore, we have paid distributions from the net proceeds of our initial offering, and in the future, may pay distributions from borrowings in anticipation of future cash flows or from other sources. Any such distributions may reduce the amount of capital we ultimately invest in assets, may negatively impact the value of our stockholders  investment and may cause subsequent investors to experience dilution. 
  We have used the net proceeds from our initial offering and borrowed funds or other sources to pay cash distributions to our stockholders, which may reduce the amount of proceeds available for investment and operations, cause us to incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds or cause subsequent investors to experience dilution. Further, if the aggregate amount of cash distributed in any given year exceeds the amount of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, the excess amount will be deemed a return of capital. Therefore, distributions payable to our stockholders may include a return of capital, rather than a return on capital. We have not established any limit on the amount of proceeds from our initial offering that may be used to fund distributions, except that, in accordance with our organizational documents and Maryland law, we may not make distributions that would: (i) cause us to be unable to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or (ii) cause our total assets to be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus senior liquidation preferences. The actual amount and timing of distributions is determined by our board, in its sole discretion and typically depends on the amount of funds available for distribution, which will depend on items such as our financial condition, current and projected capital expenditure requirements, tax considerations and annual distribution requirements needed to qualify as a REIT. As a result, our distribution rate and payment frequency may vary from time to time. 
  Our board has authorized, on a quarterly basis, a daily distribution to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on each day of the period commencing on May 14, 2014 and ending on December 31, 2016. The distributions were or will be calculated based on 365 days in the calendar year and are equal to $0.001643836 per share of our common stock, which is equal to an annualized distribution rate of 6.0%, assuming a purchase price of $10.00 per share. These daily distributions were or will be aggregated and paid monthly in arrears in cash or shares of our common stock pursuant to the DRIP and the Secondary DRIP Offering, only from legally available funds. 
  The distributions paid for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , along with the amount of distributions reinvested pursuant to the DRIP and the Secondary DRIP Offering, and the sources of our distributions as compared to cash flows from operations were as follows: 

Under GAAP, acquisition related expenses are expensed, and therefore subtracted from cash flows from operations. However, these expenses may be paid from offering proceeds or debt. 
  Our distributions of amounts in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits have resulted in a return of capital to our stockholders, and all or any portion of a distribution to our stockholders may have been paid from offering  
  
   71 

     Table of Contents  

proceeds. The payment of distributions from our initial offering proceeds could have reduced the amount of capital we ultimately invest in assets and negatively impact the amount of income available for future distributions. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had an amount payable of   $2,262,000   to our advisor or its affiliates primarily for asset and property management fees and acquisition fees, which will be paid from cash flows from operations in the future as it becomes due and payable by us in the ordinary course of business consistent with our past practice. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , no amounts due to our advisor or its affiliates had been deferred, waived or forgiven other than   $37,000   in asset management fees waived by our advisor in 2014, which was equal to the amount of distributions payable to our stockholders for the period from May 14, 2014, the date we raised the minimum offering, through June 5, 2014, the date we acquired our first property. Our advisor did not receive any additional securities, shares of our stock, or any other form of consideration or any repayment as a result of the waiver of such asset management fees. Other than the waiver of such asset management fees by our advisor to provide us with additional funds to pay initial distributions to our stockholders through June 5, 2014, our advisor and its affiliates, including our co-sponsors, have no obligation to defer or forgive fees owed by us to our advisor or its affiliates or to advance any funds to us. In the future, if our advisor or its affiliates do not defer, waive or forgive amounts due to them, this would negatively affect our cash flows from operations, which could result in us paying distributions, or a portion thereof, using borrowed funds. As a result, the amount of proceeds from borrowings available for investment and operations would be reduced, or we may incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds. 
  The distributions paid for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , along with the amount of distributions reinvested pursuant the DRIP and the Secondary DRIP Offering, and the sources of our distributions as compared to FFO were as follows: 

The payment of distributions from sources other than FFO may reduce the amount of proceeds available for investment and operations or cause us to incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds. For a further discussion of FFO, a non-GAAP financial measure, including a reconciliation of our GAAP net loss to FFO, see Part I, Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations. 
  The estimated value per share of our common stock may not reflect the value that stockholders will receive for their investment. 
  On October 5, 2016, our board, at the recommendation of the audit committee of our board, comprised solely of independent directors, unanimously approved and established an estimated per share NAV of our common stock of $9.01. We are providing this estimated per share NAV to assist broker-dealers in connection with their obligations under National Association of Securities Dealers Conduct Rule 2340, as required by FINRA with respect to customer account statements. The valuation was performed in accordance with the methodology provided in Practice Guideline 2013-01, Valuations of Publicly Registered Non-Listed REITs, issued by the IPA in April 2013, in addition to guidance from the SEC. 
  The estimated per share NAV was determined after consultation with our advisor and an independent third-party valuation firm, the engagement of which was approved by the audit committee of the board. FINRA rules provide no guidance on the methodology an issuer must use to determine its estimated per share NAV. As with any valuation methodology, our independent valuation firm s methodology is based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that may not be accurate or complete. Different parties with different assumptions and estimates could derive a different estimated per share NAV, and these differences could be significant.  
  
   72 

     Table of Contents  

The estimated per share NAV is not audited or reviewed by our independent registered public accounting firm and does not represent the fair value of our assets or liabilities according to GAAP. Accordingly, with respect to the estimated per share NAV, we can give no assurance that: 
             
    a stockholder would be able to resell his or her shares at our estimated per share NAV; 
                
    a stockholder would ultimately realize distributions per share equal to our estimated per share NAV upon liquidation of our assets and settlement of our liabilities or a sale of the company; 
                
    our shares of common stock would trade at our estimated per share NAV on a national securities exchange; 
                
    an independent third-party appraiser or other third-party valuation firm, other than the third-party valuation firm engaged by the board to assist in its determination of the estimated per share NAV, would agree with our estimated per share NAV; or 
                
    the methodology used to estimate our per share NAV would be acceptable to FINRA or comply with ERISA reporting requirements.  
     Further, the estimated per share NAV is based on the estimated value of our assets less the estimated value of our liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis, calculated as of June 30, 2016.  The value of our shares may fluctuate over time in response to developments related to individual assets in the portfolio and the management of those assets and in response to the real estate and finance markets. Going forward, we intend to engage an independent valuation firm to assist us with publishing an updated estimated per share NAV on at least an annual basis. 
  For a full description of the methodologies used to value our assets and liabilities in connection with the calculation of the estimated per share NAV, see our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 7, 2016.  
  Our stockholders are limited in their ability to sell their shares pursuant to our share repurchase plan and may have to hold their shares for an indefinite period of time.  
  Our board may reject any request for repurchase of shares, suspend (in whole or in part) the share repurchase plan at any time and from time to time upon notice to our stockholders and amend, suspend, reduce, terminate or otherwise change our share repurchase plan at any time upon 30 days  notice to our stockholders for any reason it deems appropriate. Because we only repurchase shares on a quarterly basis, depending upon when during the quarter our board makes this determination, it is possible that our stockholders would not have any additional opportunities to have their shares repurchased under the prior terms of the program, or at all, upon receipt of the notice. In addition, the share repurchase plan includes numerous restrictions that would limit stockholders  ability to sell their shares. Generally, stockholders must have held their shares for at least one year in order to participate in our share repurchase program, subject to the right of our board to waive such holding requirement in the event of the death or qualifying disability of a stockholder. Unless the shares of our common stock are being repurchased in connection with a stockholder s death or qualifying disability, the purchase price for shares repurchased under our share repurchase program will be as set forth below. We do not currently anticipate obtaining appraisals for our investments (other than investments in transactions with affiliates), and, accordingly, the estimated value of our investments should not be viewed as an accurate reflection of the fair market value of our investments nor will they represent the amount of net proceeds that would result from an immediate sale of our assets. Effective with share repurchase requests submitted during the fourth quarter 2016, the Repurchase Amount, as such term is defined in our Amended and Restated Share Repurchase Plan adopted by our board on October 5, 2016, shall be the lesser of (i) the amount per share that a stockholder paid for their shares of our common stock or (ii) the most recent estimated value of one share of our common stock, as determined by our board. Accordingly, we will repurchase shares as follows: (a) for stockholders who have continuously held their shares of our common stock for at least one year, the price will be 92.5% of the Repurchase Amount; (b) for stockholders who have continuously held their shares of our common stock for at least two years, the price will be 95.0% of the Repurchase Amount; (c) for stockholders who have continuously held their shares of our common stock for at least three years, the price will be 97.5% of the Repurchase Amount; and (d) for stockholders who have held their shares of our common stock for at least four years, or requests submitted pursuant to a death or a qualifying disability, the price will be 100.0% of the Repurchase Amount (in each case, as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to our common stock). These limits might prevent us from accommodating all repurchase requests made in any year. These restrictions severely limit our stockholders  ability to sell their shares should they require liquidity, and limit their ability to recover the value such stockholders invested or the fair market value of their shares. As a result, stockholders should not rely on our share repurchase plan to provide them with liquidity. On October 5, 2016, our board approved and established an estimated per share NAV of our common stock of $9.01.

A high concentration of our properties in a particular geographic area would magnify the effects of downturns in that geographic area. 
  To the extent that we have a concentration of properties in any particular geographic area, any adverse situation that disproportionately effects that geographic area would have a magnified adverse effect on our portfolio. As of   November 14, 2016  , properties located in Indiana accounted for approximately 37.5% of the annualized base rent of our total property portfolio. Accordingly, there is a geographic concentration of risk subject to fluctuations in such state s economy. 
  The United Kingdom s impending departure from the European Union could adversely affect us. 
  The United Kingdom, or U.K., held a referendum on June 23, 2016 in which a majority of voters voted to exit the European Union, sometimes referred to as  Brexit . The announcement of Brexit has resulted in significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange fluctuations. Presently, the value of the Great Britain pound against the U.S. dollar is significantly lower than prior to the announcement of Brexit. As described elsewhere in this report, we translate     revenue and expenses denominated in the Great Britain pound into U.S. dollars for our financial statements. During periods of a strengthening dollar, our reported operating results in the U.K.     are reduced because the Great Britain pound translates into fewer U.S. dollars. In addition, assets denominated in the Great Britain pound may decline. The long-term effects of Brexit will depend on the agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to the European Union markets and negotiations of such agreements have not yet commenced. Accordingly, Brexit could contribute to more prolonged instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, and could adversely affect European and worldwide economic and market conditions.  Any of these effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
   
  Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
  Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities  
  On July 1, 2016, we issued an aggregate of 22,500 shares of restricted common stock to our independent directors. These shares of restricted common stock were issued pursuant to our incentive plan in a private transaction exempt from registration requirements pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. The restricted common stock awards vested 20.0% on the grant date and 20.0% will vest on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date. 
  Purchase of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers 
  Our share repurchase plan allows for repurchases of shares of our common stock by us when certain criteria are met. Share repurchases will be made at the sole discretion of our board. All share repurchases are subject to a one-year holding period, except for repurchases made in connection with a stockholder s death or  qualifying disability,  as defined in our share repurchase plan and will be repurchased at a price between 92.5% and 100% of each stockholder's "Repurchase Amount," as defined in our share repurchase plan, depending on the period of time their shares have been held. Funds for the repurchase of shares of our common stock will come exclusively from the cumulative proceeds we receive from the sale of shares of our common stock pursuant to the DRIP and the Secondary DRIP Offering. Until October 4, 2016, the Repurchase Amount for shares repurchased under our share repurchase plan was equal to or lower than the most recent per share offering price. However, if shares of our common stock were to be repurchased in connection with a stockholder s death or qualifying disability, the repurchase price was no less than 100% of the price paid to acquire the shares of our common stock from us. 
  Effective October 5, 2016, with respect to share repurchase requests submitted during the fourth quarter 2016, we amended and restated our share repurchase plan by amending the definition of the term Repurchase Amount, as such term is used in the share repurchase plan. The Repurchase Amount that will be used to calculate the price at which shares of our common stock will be repurchased will be the lesser of (i) the amount per share that a stockholder paid for their shares of our common stock or (ii) the most recent estimated value of one share of our common stock, as determined by our board. In addition, the Amended and Restated Share Repurchase Plan amends the price at which shares will be repurchased as a result of a stockholder s death or qualifying disability; such shares will be repurchased at a price per share equal to 100% of the Repurchase Amount.

___________ 
           (1) 
    Subject to funds being available, we will limit the number of shares of our common stock repurchased during any calendar year to 5.0% of the weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding during the prior calendar year; provided however, shares of our common stock subject to repurchase requests upon the death of a stockholder will not be subject to this cap.
