Note 1. General Information 
    
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Pangaea Logistics Solutions Ltd. and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the  Company ,  we  or  our ). The Company is engaged in the ocean transportation of drybulk cargoes worldwide through the ownership, chartering and operation of drybulk vessels. The Company is a holding company incorporated under the laws of Bermuda as an exempted company on April 29, 2014.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned   two   Panamax,   four   Supramax and   two   Handymax Ice Class 1A drybulk vessels. The Company also owned one-third of a consolidated joint venture with a fleet of   six   Panamax Ice Class 1A drybulk vessels.  

Note 2. Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016  , the consolidated statements of income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are unaudited. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Company s financial position and results of operations and cash flows for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The financial data and the other information disclosed in these notes to the consolidated financial statements related to these   three and nine   month periods are unaudited. Certain information and disclosures included in the annual consolidated financial statements have been omitted for the interim periods pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. The results for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results for the year ending   December 31, 2016   or for any other interim period or future years. 
    
   The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The significant estimates and assumptions of the Company are the estimated salvage value used in determining depreciation expense and the allowances for doubtful accounts. 
    
  Advance hire, prepaid expenses and other current assets were comprised of the following:  

Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities were comprised of the following:

Note 3. Fixed Assets 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company s owned fleet consisted of   14   dry bulk vessels. The carrying amounts of these vessels, including unamortized drydocking costs, are as follows:  

(1)  The m/v Nordic Oasis was delivered to the Company on January 5, 2016. 

Long-lived Assets Impairment Considerations.   The carrying values of the Company s vessels may not represent their fair market value or the amount that could be obtained by selling the vessel at any point in time because the market prices of second-hand vessels tend to fluctuate with changes in charter rates and the pricing of new vessels. Historically, both charter rates and vessel values tend to be cyclical. The carrying value of each group of vessels (allocated by size, age and major characteristic or trade), which are classified as held and used by the Company, are reviewed for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a particular group may not be fully recoverable. In such instances, an impairment charge would be recognized if the estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the group and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying value. This assessment is made at the group level, which represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other groups of assets. The asset groups established by the Company are defined by vessel size and major characteristic or trade. 
    
  The significant factors and assumptions used in the undiscounted projected net operating cash flow analysis include the Company s estimate of future TCE rates based on current rates under existing charters and contracts. When existing contracts expire, the Company uses an estimated TCE based on actual results and extends these rates out to the end of the vessel s useful life. TCE rates can be highly volatile, may affect the fair value of the Company s vessels and may have a significant impact on the Company s ability to recover the carrying amount of its fleet. Accordingly, the volatility is contemplated in the undiscounted projected net operating cash flow by using a sensitivity analysis based on percent changes in the TCE rates. The Company prepares a series of scenarios in an attempt to capture the range of possible trends and outcomes. For example, in the event that TCE rates over the estimated useful lives of the entire fleet are 10% lower than expected, the impact on the total undiscounted projected net operating cash flow would be a decrease of 14%. Projected net operating cash flows are net of brokerage and address commissions and assume no revenue on scheduled offhire days. The Company uses the current vessel operating expense budget, estimated costs of drydocking and historical general and administrative expenses as the basis for its expected outflows, and applies an inflation factor it considers appropriate. The net of these inflows and outflows, plus an estimated salvage value, constitutes the projected undiscounted future cash flows. If these projected cash flows do not exceed the carrying value of the asset group, an impairment charge would be recognized.

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company identified a potential impairment indicator by reference to estimated market values of its vessel groups. As a result, the Company evaluated each group for impairment by estimating the total undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the group and its eventual disposal.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the estimated undiscounted future cash flows were determined to be higher than the carrying amount of each group. Therefore, the Company did not recognize any loss on impairment. At December 31, 2015, the carrying amount of the m/v Nordic Barents and m/v Nordic Bothnia were determined to be higher than their estimated undiscounted future cash flows. As a result, a loss on impairment of these vessels totaling approximately   $5.4 million   was included in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.   
    
  On July 5, 2016, the Company entered into five-year bareboat charter agreements with the owner of two vessels (which were then renamed the m/v Bulk Power and the m/v Bulk Progress). Under a bareboat charter, the charterer is responsible for all of the vessel operating expenses in addition to the charter hire. The agreement also contains a profit sharing arrangement. Scheduled increases in charter hire are included in minimum rental payments and recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Profit sharing will be excluded from minimum lease payments and recognized as incurred. The rent expense under these bareboat charters (which are classified as operating leases) totals approximately   $365,000   per annum. 

Note 4. Debt 
    
    Long-term debt consists of the following:  

(1)   
    The Bulk Pangaea Secured Note, the Bulk Patriot Secured Note, the Bulk Juliana Secured Note, the Bulk Trident Secured Note and the Bulk Phoenix Secured Note are cross-collateralized by the m/v Bulk Pangaea, m/v Bulk Patriot, m/v Bulk Juliana, m/v Bulk Trident and m/v Bulk Newport and are guaranteed by the Company.

In addition, the facility contains other Company and vessel related covenants that, among other things, restrict changes in management and ownership of the vessel, declaration of dividends, further indebtedness and mortgaging of a vessel without the bank s prior consent. It also requires minimum collateral maintenance, which is tested at the discretion of the lender. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with these covenants. At   December 31, 2015  , the Company was granted a waiver of compliance with the consolidated debt service coverage ratio by the facility agent and was in compliance with the other covenants.  
    
  Bulk Atlantic Secured Note 
    
  Initial amount of   $8,520,000  , entered into on February 18, 2013, for the acquisition of m/v Bulk Beothuk.

  On February 22, 2016, the Company was notified by the facility agent of an MVC breach. On March 15, 2016, additional cash collateral of approximately   $1,200,000  , which was deposited by the Company during 2015, was applied to the outstanding balance of the facility.

Note 5. Derivative Instruments and Fair Value Measurements 
    
  Interest-Rate Swaps    
    
  From time to time, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate debt. At   December 31, 2015  , the Company was party to   one   interest rate swap, which was entered into in February 2011, as required by the   109 Long Wharf Construction to Term Loan   agreement. Under the terms of the swap agreement, the interest rate was fixed at   6.63%  . The swap was cancelled in conjunction with, and the outstanding balance was financed by the   109 Long Wharf Commercial Term Loan   in May 2016, which is discussed in Note 4. 
    
  The Company did not elect to designate the swap as a hedge at inception, pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Accordingly, changes in the fair value are recorded in current earnings in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. 

11 

The fair value of the interest rate swap agreement at   December 31, 2015   was a liability of approximately   $103,000  , which was included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet based on the instrument s maturity date. The aggregate change in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were gains of   $104,000   and   $6,000  , respectively, which are reflected in the unrealized gain on derivative instruments in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.  
    
  Forward freight agreements 
    
  The Company assesses risk associated with fluctuating future freight rates and, when appropriate, hedges identified economic risk with appropriate derivative instruments, specifically forward freight agreements (FFAs). Such economic hedges do not always qualify for hedge accounting under ASC 815 and as such, the usage of such derivatives can lead to fluctuations in the Company s reported results from operations on a period-to-period basis. There were no open FFAs at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  Fuel Swap Contracts 
    
  The Company continuously monitors the market volatility associated with bunker prices and seeks to reduce the risk of such volatility through a bunker hedging program. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the year ended   December 31, 2015  , the Company entered into various fuel swap contracts that were not designated for hedge accounting. The aggregate fair value of these fuel swaps at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are liabilities of approximately   $668,000   and   $1,777,000  , respectively, which are included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The change in the aggregate fair value of the fuel swaps during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are gains of approximately   $1,109,000   and   $1,211,000  , respectively, which are included in unrealized gain on derivative instruments in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. 

The three levels of the fair value hierarchy established by ASC 820, in order of priority are as follows: 
    
  Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Our Level 1 non-derivatives include cash, money-market accounts, restricted cash accounts and investment. 
    
  Level 2   Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable. Our Level 2 non-derivatives include our term loan account. 
    
  Level 3   Inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions). 

The following table summarizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

The estimated fair values of the Company s interest rate swap instruments, forward freight agreements and fuel swap contracts are based on market prices obtained from an independent third-party valuation specialist. Such quotes represent the estimated amounts the Company would receive to terminate the contracts.

  Under the terms of a technical management agreement between the Company and Seamar Management S.A. ( Seamar ), an equity method investee, Seamar is responsible for the day-to-day operations for certain of the Company s owned vessels and the two vessels operating under bareboat charters. During the nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company incurred technical management fees of approximately   $1,411,000   and   $1,820,000  , respectively under this arrangement. These fees are included in vessel operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income. The total amounts payable to Seamar at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were approximately   $1,104,000   and   $1,255,000  , respectively.  

Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies 
    
        The Company is subject to certain asserted claims arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company intends to vigorously assert its rights and defend itself in any litigation that may arise from such claims. While the ultimate outcome of these matters could affect the results of operations of any one year, and while there can be no assurance with respect thereto, management believes that after final disposition, any financial impact to the Company would not be material to its consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
    
  Vessel Acquisition and Sale-Leaseback 
    
  In December 2013, the Company, through a 50% owned joint venture, entered into shipbuilding contracts for the construction of   two   ultramax vessels for   $28,950,000   each. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   $11,580,000   on deposit with the shipyard for these newbuildings. The fourth installments of   10%   are due and payable upon launching of the vessels and the balance is due upon delivery of the vessels. The total remaining purchase obligations under the shipbuilding contracts are   $5,790,000   in 2016 and   $40,530,000   in early 2017. 
  
   13 

On October 27, 2016, the Company entered into a sale-leaseback financing agreement for one of the two ultramax vessels under construction. The selling price of the vessel to the new owner (lessor) is   $21,000,000  . The lease back will be recorded as a capital lease based on the transfer of ownership of the vessel to the Company at the end of the seven year lease term. The Company (seller-lessee) intends to recognize a loss equal to the difference between the vessel's undepreciated cost and its fair value at the time of sale, which is expected to be January 2017. 
    
       The Company expects to finance the final payment for the second vessel with a commercial facility or sale charter-back. 
    
  Long-term Contracts Accounted for as Operating Leases 
    
  As discussed in Note 3, the Company entered into bareboat charter contracts with the owner of two ultramax vessels. The charters are recorded as operating leases and as such, the minimum rental payments are being recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Profit sharing is excluded from minimum rental payments and recognized as incurred.  
    
  The Company leases office space for its Copenhagen operations. The lease can be terminated with six months prior notice after June 30, 2018. 
    
  Obligations under Operating Leases: 

Long-term COA Amendment 
    
  On February 8, 2016, the counterparty to a long-term contract of affreightment ( COA ), a major aluminum producer, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. On May 6, 2016, the Company agreed to amend the terms of its COA, effective for cargo voyages commencing on or after May 1, 2016.  The Company has continued to provide freight services to the customer post bankruptcy petition. The amended terms include, among other things, a lower fixed cargo freight rate for the balance of calendar year 2016, a freight escalation clause based on changes in the worldwide price of aluminum for years after 2016, adjustment of the freight rate by utilization of a fuel escalation clause and settlement of pre-petition receivables outstanding for voyages prior to the Chapter 11 filing. The lower freight rates under the revised contract will negatively impact the revenue Pangaea expected  to generate from by a total of approximately   $4.2 million   for 2016. Since the bankruptcy filing, the customer has retained operations connected with the freight services we provide. On October 21, 2016, the customer obtained court approval to sell this segment of their operations and selected a buyer. The Company sees this as a positive development; however, there is no guarantee the purchaser will honor the COA in its current form or at all. If the COA is not honored, the Company would have additional capacity on two of its owned vessels. If we were unable to find suitable employment for these vessels at rates that support their carrying amounts, a loss on impairment would result and the Company may consider selling or scrapping the vessels.

When used in this Form 10-Q, words such as  anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   expect,   intend  and similar expressions, as they relate to us or our management, identify forward looking statements. Such forward looking statements are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements as a result of the risk factors and other factors detailed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All subsequent written or oral forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are qualified in their entirety by this paragraph. 
    
  Important Financial and Operational Terms and Concepts 
    
  The Company uses a variety of financial and operational terms and concepts when analyzing its performance. 
    
  These include revenue recognition, deferred revenue, allowance for doubtful accounts, vessels and depreciation and long-lived assets impairment considerations, as defined above as well as the following: 
    
  Voyage Revenue.   Voyage revenue is derived from voyage charters which involve the carriage of cargo from load port to discharge port and revenue is earned on the quantity carried. 
    
  Charter Revenue.   Charter revenue is earned when the Company lets a vessel it owns or operates to a charterer for a specified period of time.  
    
  Voyage Expenses.   The Company incurs expenses for voyage charters, including bunkers (fuel), port charges, canal tolls, brokerage commissions and cargo handling operations, which are expensed as incurred. 
    
  Charter Expenses.   The Company charters in vessels to supplement its owned fleet to support its voyage charter operations. The Company hires vessels under time charters with third party vessel owners, and recognizes the charter hire payments as an expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the charter. Charter hire payments are typically made in advance, and the unrecognized portion is reflected as advance hire in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Under the time charters, the vessel owner is responsible for the vessel operating costs such as crews, maintenance and repairs, insurance, and stores. 
    
  Vessel Operating Expenses.   Vessel operating expenses represent the cost to operate the Company s owned vessels. Vessel operating expenses include crew hire and related costs, the cost of insurance, expenses relating to repairs and maintenance, the cost of spares and consumable stores, tonnage taxes, other miscellaneous expenses, and technical management fees. These expenses are recognized as incurred. Technical management services include day-to-day vessel operations, performing general vessel maintenance, ensuring regulatory and classification society compliance, arranging the hire of crew, and purchasing stores, supplies, and spare parts. 
    
  Fleet Data.   The Company believes that the measures for analyzing future trends in its results of operations consist of the following: 
    
      Shipping days.   The Company defines shipping days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which its owned or chartered-in vessels are performing either a voyage charter (voyage days) or a time charter (time charter days). 
    
      Daily vessel operating expenses.   The Company defines daily vessel operating expenses as vessel operating expenses divided by ownership days for the period. Vessel operating expenses include crew hire and related costs, the cost of insurance, expenses relating to repairs and maintenance, the costs of spares and consumable stores, tonnage taxes, other miscellaneous expenses, and technical management fees. 
    
      Chartered in days.   The Company defines chartered in days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which it chartered in vessels from third party vessel owners. 

15 

Time Charter Equivalent   TCE   rates.   The Company defines TCE rates as total revenues less voyage expenses divided by the length of the voyage, which is consistent with industry standards. TCE rate is a common shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare daily earnings generated by vessels on time charters with daily earnings generated by vessels on voyage charters, because rates for vessels on voyage charters are generally not expressed in per-day amounts while rates for vessels on time charters generally are expressed in per-day amounts. 
    
  Overview 
    
  The seaborne drybulk transportation industry is cyclical and volatile. Demand for drybulk tonnage remains weak, rates declined to new historic lows during the first quarter and asset values for modern tonnage remained depressed due to these factors and to the over-supply of drybulk carriers. The decline in and volatility of charter and freight rates has been due to various factors, including lower crude oil prices, falling demand from China, a strong U.S. Dollar and the associated weakening of other world currencies, and to the deflationary cycle being experienced in many commodities such as iron ore, coal and agricultural products. Concurrently, with these factors, vessel supply continues to increase. The falling rate environment highlights the differentiation of our business model. Since reduced rates mean reduced fronthaul margins, our strategy to charter in vessels to serve only contracted business means we limited our carried volume of chartered-in vessels, which shielded us from losses that may have been incurred under a long-term charter-in strategy. 
    
  3rd Quarter Highlights 

Net income of   $6.1 million   for the third quarter, during a continued weak drybulk market. 
                
    Income from operations of   $7.8 million   reflecting lower voyage, charter hire and vessel operating expenses as compared to the same period of 2015. 
                 
    At the end of the quarter, Pangaea had   $28.2 million   in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. 
       
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
    
  Revenues 
    
  Pangaea s revenues are derived predominately from voyage and time charters, which are discussed below. Total revenue for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   $70.8 million  , compared to   $71.2 million   for the same period in   2015  . The total number of shipping days increased   15%   to   3,971   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   3,443   for the same period in   2015  . The average TCE rate was   $10,480   per day for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $11,849   per day for same period in   2015  . The decrease is predominantly due to ongoing weakness in the dry bulk market and to the decrease in the rate earned on one of the Company's contracts of affreightment ("COAs"). 
    
  Components of revenue are as follows: 
    
  Voyage revenues for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   increased by   2%   to   $66.0 million   compared to   $64.6 million   for the same period in   2015  . The increase in voyage revenues was predominantly driven by the   19%   increase in the number of voyage days, which were   3,364   in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to   2,824   in the third quarter of 2015. Total revenues were hampered by the ongoing weakness in dry bulk market rates as evidenced by the decline in TCE rates as noted above. 
    
  Charter revenues decreased to   $4.8 million   from   $6.6 million  , or   27%  , for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . The decrease in charter revenues was due to the ongoing weak market and to the strategy employed by the Company to minimize excess capacity by chartering in vessels only to meet existing contracts. This strategy does not leave any excess tonnage available to be chartered to other operators. Time charter days were   607   in the third quarter of 2016 versus   619   in the third quarter of 2015.  
    
  Voyage Expenses 
    
  Voyage expenses for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   were   $29.2 million  , compared to   $30.4 million   for the same period in   2015  , a decrease of approximately   4%  . The decrease in voyage expense was primarily due to a decrease of $4.5 million  
  
   16 

in cargo relet expense. This was offset by a $0.4 million decrease in gain on bunker redeliveries and an increase in port expenses of $3.1 million. 
    
  Cargo relet expense, which is incurred when the Company hires another owner or operator to perform its obligations under a spot contract, was approximately $4.5 million in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , however the Company did not relet any cargoes in the third quarter of 2016 because the arbitrage opportunities did not exist during the period. The increase in port expenses reflects the fact that the number of voyages increased and therefore, the number of port calls have increased. 
    
  Charter Hire Expenses 
    
  Charter hire expenses for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   were   $19.7 million  , compared to   $20.6 million   for the same period in   2015  . The number of chartered in days increased   12%   from   2,277   days in the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to   2,548   days for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   while the weak market pushed average charter hire rates down   15%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period of   2015  . The Company has continued to operate under its successful strategy of chartering in only for committed contracts. However, modest increases in TCE rates and demand in the third quarter resulted in a 19% increase in voyage revenue days in 2016, many of which are performed on chartered-in ships. 
    
  Vessel Operating Expenses 
    
  Vessel operating expenses for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   were   $7.5 million  , compared to   $8.5 million   in the comparable period in   2015  , a decrease of approximately   12%  . Vessel operating expenses during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   include the recovery of approximately $0.6 million of costs incurred earlier in the year for repairs that were later reimbursed by the insurance carrier. In addition, drydock expenses of approximately $0.4 million were incurred in the third quarter of 2015 and the vessel sold in the third quarter of 2015 incurred approximately $0.4 million of operating expense in that period. These amounts were offset by the increase of $0.9 million incurred for the two vessels under bareboat charters in the third quarter of 2016. Vessel operating expense expressed on a per day basis decreased to   $5,168   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from $  6,808   for the same period in   2015  . 
    
  General and Administrative 
    
  Pangaea s general and administrative expenses include legal and professional fees, rent, payroll and related expenses for its corporate offices. General and administrative expenses for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $3.2 million   and   $3.6 million  , respectively, a decrease of approximately   12%  , which is due to the reductions in legal and professional fees of approximately $0.3 million and to travel expenses, which decreased approximately $0.1 million. 
    
  Income from Operations  
    
  The Company has income from operations of   $7.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to   $4.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Total revenue had only a modest decline of   1%   from   $71.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $70.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   which is due to ongoing weakness in the dry bulk shipping market and the rate reduction on a COA. However, voyage, charter hire, vessel operating and general and administrative expenses all decreased in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. 
    
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
    
  Revenues 
    
  Total revenue for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $171.7 million  , compared to   $231.4 million   for the same period in 2015. The total number of shipping days decreased   6%   to   10,290   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   10,985   for the same period in 2015. The reduction was predominantly in the first quarter of 2016, when the Baltic Dry Index ( BDI ), a measure of dry bulk market performance, was at historic lows. The average TCE rate was   $9,451   per day for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $11,612   per day for same period in 2015. This is predominantly due to the decline in the overall dry bulk market and to a decrease in the rate earned on one of the Company's COAs for much of 2016.  
    
  Components of revenue are as follows: 
    
  Voyage revenues for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased by   25%   to   $161.5 million   compared to   $216.1 million   for the same period in 2015. The decrease in voyage revenues was primarily driven by the sharp decline in market rates from the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and to the decrease  
  
   17 

in the rate earned on a COA employing three vessels on a continuous basis. The Baltic Dry Index ( BDI ), a measure of dry bulk market performance, was at its historic low in the first quarter of 2016, rose only slightly in the second quarter and made modest gains in the third quarter. 
    
  Charter revenues decreased to   $10.2 million   from   $15.3 million  , or   34%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in charter revenues was due to the continued weakness in the dry bulk market and to the decrease in the number of time charter days, which were   1,530   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   versus   1,659   in the first half of 2015. During a down market, the Company limits its use of non-owned vessels to meet existing contractual obligations. This strategy does not leave any excess tonnage available to be chartered to other operators.  
    
  Voyage Expenses 
    
  Voyage expenses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   $74.4 million  , compared to   $103.8 million   for the same period in 2015, a decrease of approximately   28%  . The decrease in voyage expenses was due the $18.0 million (36%) decrease in the aggregate cost of bunkers consumed on voyages and to the decrease of $15.1 million in cargo relet expense.  These amounts were offset by a $3.6 million decrease in gain on bunker redeliveries. 
    
  The decrease in the cost of bunkers consumed predominantly reflects the decline in bunker prices, which were down an average of 13% from   September 30, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  . Cargo relet expense, which is incurred when the Company hires another owner or operator to perform its obligations under a spot contract, was approximately $15.1 million in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  ; however the Company did not relet any cargoes in the three months ended September 30, 2016 because the arbitrage opportunities did not exist during the period.  
    
  Charter Hire Expenses 
    
  Charter hire expenses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   $43.2 million  , compared to   $60.5 million   for the same period in 2015. The number of chartered in days decreased   10%   from   7,252   days in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   6,546   days for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   while the weak market pushed average daily charter hire rates down   21%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period of 2015. The Company has continued to operate under its successful strategy of chartering in only for committed contracts, limiting its exposure while market conditions remain depressed.  
    
  Vessel Operating Expenses 
    
  Vessel operating expenses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   $22.3 million  , compared to   $23.4 million   in the comparable period in 2015. Vessel operating expense expressed on a per day basis were   $5,581   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to   $6,225   for the same period in 2015. Vessel operating expenses were lower in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to the fact that two vessels sold in the nine months ended 2015 incurred approximately $2.0 million of expenses in that period. These reductions were offset by the increase of $0.9 million incurred for the two vessels under bareboat charters in the third quarter of 2016.  
    
  General and Administrative 
    
  Pangaea s general and administrative expenses include legal and professional fees, rent, payroll and related expenses for its corporate offices. General and administrative expenses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015 were   $9.2 million   and   $11.8 million  , respectively, a decrease of approximately   23%   which is due to the reductions in accrued bonus compensation of $0.9 million, legal fees of $0.4 million, director fees of $0.1 million, professional fees of $0.5 million, travel and related expenses of $0.2 million, office expenses of $0.2 million and miscellaneous expenses of $0.3 million. The accrued bonus is tied to results and all other reductions are due to the efforts made by the Company to lower its overhead. 
    
  Depreciation and Amortization 
    
  The increase in depreciation and amortization from   $9.5 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $10.6 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   is due to the acquisition of new vessels in the first quarters of both 2016 and 2015. Depreciation expense on new vessels is significantly higher than that of second-hand vessels purchased opportunistically at lower market prices. 
    
  Income from Operations 
  
   18 

The Company has income from operations of   $12.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to   $21.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Total revenue declined   26%   from   $231.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $171.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as a result of continued weakness in the dry bulk shipping market. The BDI began its descent in the second quarter of 2015 and continued to drop to new historical lows into the first quarter of 2016 before improving modestly in the second and third quarters. In addition, voyage, charter hire and general and administrative expenses decreased   28%  ,   29%   and   23%  , respectively, in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Significant accounting estimates 
    
  Long-lived Assets Impairment Considerations 
    
  The carrying values of the Company s vessels may not represent their fair market value or the amount that could be obtained by selling the vessel at any point in time because the market prices of second-hand vessels tend to fluctuate with changes in charter rates and the pricing of new vessels. Historically, both charter rates and vessel values tend to be cyclical. The carrying value of each group of vessels (allocated by size, age and major characteristic or trade), which are classified as held and used by the Company, are reviewed for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a particular group may not be fully recoverable. In such instances, an impairment charge would be recognized if the estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the group and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying value. This assessment is made at the group level, which represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other groups of assets. The asset groups established by the Company are defined by vessel size and major characteristic or trade. 
    
  The significant factors and assumptions used in the undiscounted projected net operating cash flow analysis include the Company s estimate of future TCE rates based on current rates under existing charters and contracts. When existing contracts expire, the Company uses an estimated TCE based on actual results and extends these rates out to the end of the vessel s useful life. TCE rates can be highly volatile, may affect the fair value of the Company s vessels and may have a significant impact on the Company s ability to recover the carrying amount of its fleet. Accordingly, the volatility is contemplated in the undiscounted projected net operating cash flow by using a sensitivity analysis based on percent changes in the TCE rates. The Company prepares a series of scenarios in an attempt to capture the range of possible trends and outcomes. For example, in the event that TCE rates over the estimated useful lives of the entire fleet are 10% lower than expected, the impact on the total undiscounted projected net operating cash flow would be a decrease of 14%. Projected net operating cash flows are net of brokerage and address commissions and assume no revenue on scheduled offhire days. The Company uses the current vessel operating expense budget, estimated costs of drydocking and historical general and administrative expenses as the basis for its expected outflows, and applies an inflation factor it considers appropriate. The net of these inflows and outflows, plus an estimated salvage value, constitutes the projected undiscounted future cash flows. If these projected cash flows do not exceed the carrying value of the asset group, an impairment charge would be recognized. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company identified a potential impairment indicator by reference to estimated market values of its vessel groups. As a result, the Company evaluated each group for impairment by estimating the total undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the group and its eventual disposal.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the estimated undiscounted future cash flows were determined to be higher than the carrying amount of each group. Therefore, the Company did not recognize any loss on impairment. At December 31, 2105, the carrying amount of the m/v Nordic Barents and m/v Nordic Bothnia were determined to be higher than their estimated undiscounted future cash flows because estimated TCE rates anticipated in the analysis have declined. The decrease in TCE rates is due to the fact that these vessels are older and are not preferable in a weakening market where there is an oversupply of newer tonnage. As a result, a loss on impairment of these vessels totaling approximately   $5.4 million   is included in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.   

19 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Liquidity and Cash Needs 
    
  The Company has historically financed its capital requirements with cash flow from operations, proceeds from related party debt, and proceeds from long-term debt. The Company may consider debt or additional equity financing alternatives from time to time. However, if market conditions are negative, the Company may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms or at all. As a result, the Company may be unable to pursue opportunities to expand its business. 
    
  BVH, a 50% owned subsidiary of the Company, has made all of its newbuilding deposits required to date by using funds from related party loans from its shareholders, the Company and ST Shipping and Transport Ltd. ( ST Shipping ). The Company believes that ST Shipping will continue to meet the deposit schedule for the newbuildings by making additional related party loans, and will not call any existing related party loans. However, if BVH's shareholders do not provide required funds, BVH would likely need to seek replacement financing, which may not be available on acceptable terms. In such case, the Company may not be able to pursue opportunities to expand its business or meet its other commitments. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company has working capital deficits of   $2.4 million   and   $2.8 million  , respectively, due primarily to loans and dividends payable to the Founders and their affiliated entities. These liabilities will only be paid when cash flow is sufficiently in excess of normal operating requirements.  
    
  Considerations made by management in assessing the Company s ability to continue as a going concern are its ability to consistently generate positive cash flows from operations, which were approximately   $18.3 million   and   $17.4 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively;   $26.0 million   in   2015   and   $19.7 million   in   2014  ; its excess of cash on hand over the current portion of secured long-term debt, which was   $10.2 million   at September 30, 2016,   $18.0 million   and   $12.0 million   at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively; and its ability to procure long-term fixed contract employment (COAs) with new and longstanding customers. In addition, the Company has demonstrated its unique ability to adapt to changing market conditions by changing the chartered-in profile to meet its cargo commitments. For more information on the results of operations, see   ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Results of Operations. 
    
  Capital Expenditures 
    
  The Company s capital expenditures relate to the purchase of interests in vessels, and capital improvements to its vessels which are expected to enhance the revenue earning capabilities and safety of these vessels. The Company s fleet includes two Panamax drybulk carriers, four Supramax drybulk carriers and two Handymax drybulk carriers (both of which are Ice-Class 1A). The Company also has a one-third interest in a consolidated joint venture which owns six Panamax Ice-Class 1A drybulk carriers. 
    
  In addition to vessel acquisitions that the Company may undertake in future periods, its other major capital expenditures include funding its program of regularly scheduled drydockings necessary to make improvements to its vessels, as well as to comply with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations. Funding expenses associated with meeting these requirements will be met with cash from operations. The Company anticipates that this process of recertification will require it to reposition these vessels from a discharge port to shipyard facilities, which will reduce the Company s available days and operating days during that period.  
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  The Company does not have off-balance sheet arrangements at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .    

20 

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  The international shipping industry is capital intensive, requiring significant amounts of investment provided in the form of long-term debt. Certain of the Company s outstanding debt contain floating interest rates that fluctuate with changes in the financial markets and in particular changes in LIBOR. Increasing interest rates could increase the Company s interest expense and adversely impact its future earnings. In the past, the Company has managed this risk by entering into interest rate swap agreements in which the Company exchanged fixed and variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts. The Company has used such derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes. As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company was a party to one interest rate swap agreement, which had an approximate fair value of   $0.1 million   (liability). The Company s net effective exposure to floating interest rate fluctuations on its outstanding debt was $136.3 million and $122.8 million, respectively, at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The Company s interest expense is affected by changes in the general level of interest rates, particularly LIBOR. As an indication of the extent of the Company s sensitivity to interest rate changes, an increase in LIBOR of 1% would have decreased the Company s net income and cash flows during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   by approximately $0.9 million and $0.6 million, respectively, based on the debt levels at the beginning of each period. The Company expects its sensitivity to interest rate changes to increase in the future if the Company enters into additional debt agreements in connection with its acquisition of additional vessels. 
    
  Forward Freight Agreements 
    
  The Company assesses risk associated with fluctuating future freight rates and, when appropriate, hedges identified economic risk with appropriate derivative instruments, specifically forward freight agreements (FFAs). Such economic hedges do not always qualify for hedge accounting under ASC 815 and as such, the usage of such derivatives can lead to fluctuations in the Company s reported results from operations on a period-to-period basis. There were no open FFAs at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  Fuel Swap Contracts    
    
  The Company continuously monitors the market volatility associated with bunker prices and seeks to reduce the risk of such volatility through a bunker hedging program. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the year ended   December 31, 2015  , the Company entered into various fuel swap contracts that were not designated for hedge accounting. The aggregate fair value of these fuel swaps at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are liabilities of approximately   $668,000   and   (1,777,000)  , which are included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
