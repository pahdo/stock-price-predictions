1.      Organization
                                         and nature of operations     

Rebel
Group, Inc. (f/k/a Inception Technology Group, Inc., the  Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the State of
Florida on September 13, 2011. The Company organizes, promotes and hosts mixed martial arts ( MMA ) events featuring
top level athletic talent. With assistance from contracted production crews, the Company also produces and distributes, through
the internet and social media, and sells the rights to distribute to television stations, videos of its MMA events. The Company
seeks to promote MMA in Asian countries through hosting events that attract talented fighters from all over the world.  

On
January 30, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Rebel Holdings Limited ( Rebel FC ) pursuant to a Share Exchange
Agreement. ( Share Exchange Agreement,  such transaction, the  Share Exchange Transaction ), whereby the
Company issued to the Rebel FC Stockholder an aggregate of 20,700,000 shares of its Common Stock, in exchange for 100% of the
equity interests of Rebel FC held by the Rebel FC Stockholder. The shares of our Common Stock received by the Rebel FC Stockholder
in the Share Exchange Transaction constitute approximately 90% of our issued and outstanding Common Stock giving effect to the
issuance of shares pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement. As a result of the Share Exchange Transaction, Rebel FC, together
with its subsidiaries, Pure Heart Entertainment Pte Ltd. ( Pure Heart ) and SCA Capital Limited ( SCA Capital ),
became the Company s wholly-owned subsidiaries. The acquisition was accounted for as a reverse merger and recapitalization
effected by the Share Exchange Transaction. Rebel FC is considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes.
The assets and liabilities of the acquired entity have been brought forward at their book value and no goodwill has been recognized.  

The
exchange transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of
America. For financial reporting purposes, this transaction is classified as a recapitalization of the Company and Pure Heart.
The accompanying audited consolidated financial statements were retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the recapitalization
of the financial statements of the Company and the historical financial statements of Pure Heart.  

Also
on January 30, 2015, we transferred 100% equity interests of Moxian Intellectual Property Limited ( Moxian IP), our subsidiary,
to Moxian, Inc. ( MOXC ) pursuant to the Equity Transfer Agreement. As a result of the Equity Transfer Transaction,
Moxian IP ceased to be a subsidiary of the Company.  

Rebel
FC, which utilizes the trade name of Rebel Fighting Championship, was incorporated on October 28, 2014 in British Virgin Islands
and engages in hosting and promoting MMA events since its corporation.  

Pure
Heart was incorporated under the laws of the Singapore on August 24, 2000 under the name  Sook Kee Coffeeshop Pte. Ltd. 
Effective on November 27, 2002, it changed its name to  Asia Pacific Export International Pte Ltd.  It later changed
its name from  Asia Pacific Export International Pte Ltd.  to  Pure Heart Entertainment Pte Ltd.  on June
7, 2013. As of October 30, 2014, it became a wholly owned subsidiary of Rebel FC. Pure Heart is an operating subsidiary of the
Company and is dedicated to hosting and promoting MMA events.  

SCA
Capital, a British Virgin Islands company, was incorporated on January 7, 2011 and holds the intellectual property rights relating
to the Rebel FC business. On October 28, 2014, SCA Capital became the wholly-owned subsidiary of Rebel FC.  

2.      Summary
                                         of principal accounting policies     

Basis of presentation   

The consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries are prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).

2.      Summary
                                         of principal accounting policies (Continued)     

Basis
of presentation  (Continued)  

All
significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.  

The Company's audited consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The fiscal year end is December 31.  

Revenue recognition   

Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.  

Use of estimates   

The preparation of the combined financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the combined financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Cash and cash equivalents   

Cash
and cash equivalents consist of bank deposits with original maturities of three months or less, which are unrestricted as to withdrawal
and use the Company maintained accounts at banks and have not experienced any losses from such concentrations.  

Fair
value of financial instruments   

ASC
Topic 825, Financial Instruments ( Topic 825 ) requires disclosure of fair value information of financial instruments,
whether or not recognized in the balance sheets, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. In cases where quoted market
prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques
are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. In that regard,
the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, could not be
realized in immediate settlement of the instruments. Topic 825 excludes certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial assets
and liabilities from its disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts do not represent the underlying
value of the Company.  

Level 1  
      inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices
(unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.   

Level 2  
      inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices
for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly
or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.   

Level 3  
      inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable
and significant to the fair value.   

As
of September 30, 2016 and 2015, financial instruments of the Company primarily comprise of cash, other receivables and accrued
expenses, which were carried at cost on the balance sheets, and carrying amounts approximated their fair values because of their
generally short maturities.

2.      Summary
                                         of principal accounting policies (Continued)     

Foreign
currency translation and transactions   

The
reporting currency of the Company is United States Dollars ( US$ ), which is also the Company s functional currency.
The Singapore subsidiaries maintain their books and records in its local currency, the Singapore dollar ( SGD ), which
is their functional currencies as being the primary currency of the economic environment in which these entities operate.  

Transactions
in foreign currencies other than functional currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency rate ruling at the date
of transaction. Any differences between the initially recorded amount and the settlement amount are recorded as a gain or loss
on foreign currency transaction in the statements of income. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are
translated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Any differences are taken to profit or
loss as a gain or loss on foreign currency translation in the statements of income.  

In
accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters, the Company translated the assets and liabilities into US dollars using
the rate of exchange prevailing at the applicable balance sheet date and the statements of income and cash flows are translated
at an average rate during the reporting period.  Adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded in investors 
equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive income.  

Income
taxes   

The
Company utilizes FASB Accounting Standard Codification Topic 740 ( ASC 740 )  Income taxes  (formerly
known as SFAS No. 109,  Accounting for Income Taxes ), which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities
for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the combined financial statements or tax returns.
Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory
tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established,
when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.  

ASC
740  Income taxes  (formerly known as Interpretation No. 48,  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109  ( FIN 48 )) clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in
tax positions. This interpretation requires that an entity recognizes in the audited consolidated financial statements the impact
of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits
of the position. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized.
Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company has elected
to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if and when required, as part of income tax expense in
the statements of operations. The adoption of ASC 740 did not have a significant effect on the audited consolidated financial
statements.

2.      Summary
                                         of principal accounting policies (Continued)     

Earnings
per share   

Basic
earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period while the effects of
potential common shares outstanding during the period are included in diluted earnings per share.  The average market
price during the year is used to compute equivalent shares.  

FASB
Accounting Standard Codification Topic 260 ( ASC 260 ),  Earnings Per Share , requires that employee equity
share options, non-vested shares and similar equity instruments granted to employees be treated as potential common shares in
computing diluted earnings per share. Diluted earnings per share should be based on the actual number of options or shares granted
and not yet forfeited, unless doing so would be anti-dilutive. The Company uses the  treasury stock  method for equity
instruments granted in share-based payment transactions provided in ASC 260 to determine diluted earnings per share.  

Plant
and equipment   

Plant
and equipment are recorded at cost. Significant additions or improvements extending useful lives of assets are capitalized. Maintenance
and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives as follows:  

Intangible
assets   

Intangible
assets, comprising trade mark and other intangible assets, which are separable from the fixed assets, are stated at cost less
accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 10 years.  

Long-term
investment   

Investments
comprise marketable securities which are classified as available-for-sale securities and are carried at fair value with unrealized
gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a separate component of shareholders  equity (deficit). The Company determines
any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method, and records such gains
and losses as a component of other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of income.  

Comprehensive
income   

The
Company has adopted FASB Accounting Standard Codification Topic 220 ( ASC 220 )  Comprehensive income 
(formerly known as SFAS No. 130,  Reporting Comprehensive Income ), which establishes standards for reporting and
display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. Accumulated other comprehensive income represents the
accumulated balance of foreign currency translation adjustments of the Company.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Guidance   

The
Company does not believe other recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards from ASU 2016-16, if currently adopted,
would have a material effect of the condensed consolidated financial position, results of operation and cash flows.

       Long-term investment    

On
January 30, 2015, MOXC issued a convertible promissory note to the Company for $7,782,000 (the  MOXC Note ). The MOXC
Note would become due and payable on October 30, 2015. Under the MOXC Note, MOXC has the option to convert any and all amounts
due under the MOXC Note into the shares of MOXC s shares of common stock (the  MOXC Common Stock ) at the conversion
price of $1.00 per share ( Conversion Price ), if the volume weighted average price ( VWAP ) of MOXC Common
Stock for 30 trading days immediately prior to the date of conversion is higher than the Conversion Price. MOXC also has a right
of first refusal to purchase the shares issuable upon conversion of the MOXC Note at the price of 80% of the VWAP of MOXC Common
Stock for 30 trading days immediately prior to the date of the proposed repurchase by MOXC.  

On
August 14, 2015, due to the VWAP of the MOXC Common Stock for 30 trading day prior to August 14, 2015 is higher than $1.00, which
triggered the clause of conversion under the MOXC Note, MOXC notified the Company that it elected to convert the amount of $3,891,000
under the MOXC Note into 3,891,000 shares of the MOXC Common Stock at the conversion price of $1.00 ( August Conversion ).
As a result of the August Conversion, the remainder amount of the MOXC Note was $3,891,000.  

On
September 28, 2015, MOXC notified the Company that it elected to convert the remainder of the MOXC Note, of $3,891,000 into 3,891,000
shares of the MOXC Common Stock ( September Conversion ). After the August Conversion and September Conversion, consequently,
all of the MOXC Note was converted into the total of 7,782,000 shares of the MOXC Common Stock with no amount of the MOXC Note
is outstanding as of March 31, 2016.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company has no intention to sell the investment.  

The
interest expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $825 and $3,031, respectively. And interest expenses
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $231 and $406, respectively.  

On
August 15, 2014, Pure Heart and DBS Bank entered into a banking facility (the  Banking Facility ), pursuant to which
DBS Bank disbursed Singapore dollar $50,000 to Pure Heart for working capital. The interest rate of the loan is 6.00% per annum
on monthly outstanding balance. The term for the banking facility is three years. Pure Heart shall repay in 36 installments for
Singapore dollar $1,522 each month. Mr. Leong Khian Kiee and Mr. Leong Aan Yee, Justin, the directors of Pure Heart personally
guaranteed the Banking Facility jointly and severally.

investors (the  Purchasers ), pursuant to which Stark sold to the Purchasers her 9,000,000 shares of Common Stock
of the Company.  

On

230,000,000 shares of Common Stock prior to the Reverse Split decreased and without any further action from the Company s
stockholders, to 46,000,000 shares of common stock. The Reverse Split will not alter the total number of the authorized shares

Overview   

Rebel
Holdings Limited, which utilizes the trade name of Rebel Fighting Championship ( Rebel FC ), was incorporated on October
28, 2014 in the British Virgin Islands and has engaged in hosting and promoting mixed martial arts ( MMA ) events
since its incorporation.  

Pure
Heart Entertainment Pte Ltd. ( Pure Heart ) was incorporated under the laws of Singapore on August 24, 2000 under
the name  Sook Kee Coffeeshop Pte. Ltd.  Effective on November 27, 2002, it changed its name to  Asia Pacific
Export International Pte Ltd.  It later changed its name from  Asia Pacific Export International Pte Ltd.  to
 Pure Heart Entertainment Pte Ltd.  on June 7, 2013. On October 30, 2014, Pure Heart became a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Rebel FC.  

SCA
Capital Limited ( SCA Capital ), a British Virgin Islands company, was incorporated on January 7, 2011 and holds the
intellectual property rights relating to the Rebel FC business. On October 28, 2014, SCA Capital became the wholly-owned subsidiary
of Rebel FC.  

The
Company, through Rebel FC, seeks to organize, promote and host MMA events featuring top level athletic talent. With assistance
from contracted production crews, the Company also seeks to produce and distribute videos of its MMA events, through the internet,
social media, and selling the rights to such videos to distribute to television stations.  

The
Company seeks to promote MMA in Asian countries through hosting events that attract talented fighters from all over the world.
MMA is unarmed combat involving the use of a combination of techniques from different disciplines of martial arts, including,
without limitation, grappling, submission holds, kicking and striking. The styles of martial arts range from Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu,
Judo, Karate, Boxing, Muay Thai, Wrestling, Jeet Kune Do, Taekwondo, Sanshou and various other forms of martial arts. Unlike boxing,
where athletes can only strike with their fists and only above the belt, the fighters in MMA can use punches, kicks, elbows, knee
strikes, takedowns and submissions to win a contest.  

On
June 25, 2016, the Company held an event titled Battle Royale Ascension at the Qingdao Sports Centre together with Qingdao Leibo
Sports Culture Co. Ltd ( QLSC ) QLSC has been billed by Pure Heart for $250,000 for this event, of which $200,000
has been received to date. Such fees have been used by the Company to pay its operating expenses and the remainder of the fees
still to be received are planned to be used for general working capital purposes.  

The
Company plans to potentially hold one additional event in Guangzhou in 2016 together with QLSC. However there can be no assurance
that such event can actually occur, or even if it does occur there can be no guarantee that such event will be successful.  

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our retained earnings were $7,650,961 and $7,667,045, respectively. Our stockholders 
equity was $27,926,317 and $27,948,080, for September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As
of September 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of ($235,308) consisting of cash on hand of $14,877 as compared to a working
capital deficit of ($218,693) and cash on hand of $53,090 as of December 31, 2015. The deficit was due mainly to an amount due

Net
cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $208,859 as compared to net cash used in operating

fees, professional fees, payroll and benefits and general expenses.  

The
decrease of net cash used in operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was due to a decrease in trade and other receivables.  

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $173,754 as compared to $414,012 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. The cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was
primarily from an amount due to a shareholder.  

The
Company will require additional capital to continue to operate our business, and to further expand our business. Sources of additional
capital through various financing transactions or arrangements with third parties may include equity or debt financing, bank loans
or revolving credit facilities. We may not be successful in locating suitable financing transactions in the time period required
or at all, and we may not obtain the capital we require by other means. Our inability to raise additional funds when required
may have a negative impact on our operations, business development and financial results.  

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates   

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent liabilities at dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods.
Actual results could differ from these estimates. Our significant estimates and assumptions include depreciation and the fair
value of our stock, stock-based compensation, debt discount and the valuation allowance relating to the Company s deferred
tax assets.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

Reference
is made to the  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  in Note 2 to the Financial Statements included in this Report for
information related to new accounting pronouncement, none of which had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements,
and the future adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements, which we do not expect will have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.   

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

As
of September 30, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.  

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide
the information under this item.  

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures .  

Disclosures
Control and Procedures   

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control
over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers and
effected by the Company s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:  

Pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the Company;  

Provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and  

Provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems,
no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of
internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control
over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore,
it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.  

As
of September 30, 2016, our CEO evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Disclosure controls
and procedure include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Management is responsible for monitoring
the process pursuant to which information is gathered and analyze such information to determine the extent to which such information
requires disclosure in the reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based on such evaluation, our CEO has concluded
that as of September 30, 2016, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective due to the Company s
lacks of formal documented controls and procedures applicable to all officers and directors. The Company originally planned to
prepare and adopt formal documented controls and procedures by the end of 2016, however this was not able to be accomplished due
to insufficient qualified accounting staff. The Company now plans to work on preparing and adopting formal documented controls
and anticipates having them in place in early 2017.  

As
of September 30, 2016, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria
for effective internal control over financial reporting established in by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission s 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that
evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective
to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed
in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and
that may be considered to be material weaknesses.  

The
matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were:  

(1)
lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors
on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls
and procedures;  

  (2)
inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and  

  (3)
ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes.  

The
aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive Officer in connection with the review of our financial
statements as of September 30, 2106.  

Management
believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (1), (2) and (3) above did not have an effect on our financial results.
However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on
our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and
procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods.  

Management s
Remediation Initiatives   

In
an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated,
or plan to initiate, the following series of measures:  

We
plan to create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and plan to increase our personnel resources
and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to us.  

And,
we plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors in early 2017, who shall be appointed to an audit committee
resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required
internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available
to us.  

Management
believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors, who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee,
may remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board.  

We
anticipate that these initiatives may be at least partially, if not fully, implemented in early 2017. Additionally, we plan to
test our updated controls and remediate our deficiencies by December 2017.  

(b)
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.   

As
reported by the Company in its Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 23, 2016, the Company received a letter
from Dominic Chan, on behalf of DCAW (CPA) Ltd ( DCAW ), notifying the Company that effective April 30, 2016, its
independent registered public accounting firm, Dominic K.F. Chan   Co ( DKC ), had merged with AWC (CPA) Limited
(the  Merger ) and formed DCAW. The letter also advised that in connection with the Merger and pursuant to the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board s (the  PCAOB ) Rules 2108 and 2109, DCAW, of which Mr. Dominic Chan is the
managing director, had succeeded to the registration status with the PCAOB, of a predecessor, in this case such predecessor being
DKC, effective from May 1, 2016 and therefore DCAW is registered with the PCAOB.  

As
a result of the Merger and DCAW succeeding to DKC s registration with the PCAOB, DKC resigned as the Company s independent
registered public accounting firm on April 30, 2016. On August 19, 2016, the Company engaged DCAW as its independent registered
public accounting firm. The Company s board of directors (the  Board ), approved the resignation of DKC and
the appointment of DCAW as its independent registered public accounting firm on August 19, 2016.  

DKC s
report on our financial statements for the fiscal year(s) ended September 30, 2013 and September 30, 2014, did not contain any
adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.
DKC s reports on our financial statements for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014, and September 30, 2013, however,
stated that there was substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

During
the fiscal years ended September 30, 2013 and September 30, 2014, we have had no disagreements with DKC, on any matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved
to the satisfaction of DKC, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of such disagreements in its report on
our financial statements for such periods.  

During
the fiscal years ended September 30, 2013 and September 30, 2014, there have been no reportable events as defined under Item 304(a)(1)(v)
of Regulation S-K adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  

Prior
to DCAW s engagement by the Company, neither the Company, nor anyone on the Company's behalf, previously consulted with
DCAW regarding either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or
the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's consolidated financial statements or (ii) any matter that was
either the subject of a disagreement as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and its related instructions or a reportable
event as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. Further, there was no written report or oral advice provided by the Company
or anyone on the Company s behalf to DCAW prior to DCAW s engagement by the Company.  

The
Company provided DKC with a copy of the Current Report on Form 8-K prior to its filing with the SEC and requested DKC to furnish
