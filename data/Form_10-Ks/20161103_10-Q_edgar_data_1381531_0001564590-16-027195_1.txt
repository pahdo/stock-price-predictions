 BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
 The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and, in the opinion of Management, include all adjustments that are necessary for the fair statement of Domtar Corporation s ( the Company ) financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the interim periods presented. Results for the first nine months of the year may not necessarily be indicative of full year results. It is suggested that these consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Domtar Corporation Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The December 31, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet, presented for comparative purposes in this interim report, was derived from audited consolidated financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 ACCOUNTING CHANGES IMPLEMENTED 
 PRESENTATION OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS 
 In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,  which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability, consistent with the presentation of a debt discount. In August 2015, the FASB also issued ASU 2015-15,  Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements,  which allows debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements to be presented as an asset.  
   
 The Company adopted the new requirements on January 1, 2016 with retrospective application. The effect of this change in accounting policy on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as at December 31, 2015 was a reduction of $9 million in Other assets and Long-term debt. 
 FUTURE ACCOUNTING CHANGES 
 REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS 
 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  The core principal of this guideline is that an entity should recognize revenue, to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity is entitled to, in exchange for those goods and services. This new guidance will supersede the revenue recognition requirements found in topic 605.  
   
 ASU 2014-09 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted only for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  
   
 The Company is currently evaluating these changes to determine how they will impact the consolidated financial statements. 
   
 INVENTORY 
 In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,  which simplifies the measurement of inventories valued under FIFO   first-in, first-out   and moving average methods. Under this new guidance, inventories valued under these methods would be valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling costs less reasonable costs to sell the inventory. This ASU does not change the measurement principles for inventories valued under the LIFO   last-in, first-out   method. The amendments in the update are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments should be applied prospectively and early adoption is permitted. 
   
 The Company does not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

 NOTE 2   RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS (CONTINUED) 
   
  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  
 In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,  which amends the guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Although the ASU retains many current requirements, it significantly revises an entity s accounting related to the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. The ASU also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments.  
   
 The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. To adopt the amendments, the Company will be required to make a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is permitted.  
   
 The Company does not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
   
 LEASES 
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases,  which requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all of their leases with a lease term greater than 12 months while continuing to recognize expenses in the statement of earnings in a manner similar to current accounting standards. For lessors, the new standard modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.  
   
 The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the consolidated financial statements.  
   
 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows.  This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.  
   
 The Company does not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
   
 DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING 
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-05,  Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships,  which clarifies that "a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument in an existing hedging relationship would not, in and of itself, be considered a termination of the derivative instrument" or "a change in a critical term of the hedging relationship." As long as all other hedge accounting criteria in ASC 815 are met, a hedging relationship in which the hedging derivative instrument is novated would not be discontinued or require redesignation. This clarification applies to both cash flow and fair value hedging relationships. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.  
   
 The Company does not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

  CLASSIFICATION OF CASH FLOWS  
 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows  which amends ASC 230 to add or clarify guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. The new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The guidance must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented but it may be applied prospectively if retrospective application would be impracticable. Early adoption is permitted. 
   
 The Company does not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

      NOTE   3.  
 _________________ 
 DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT 
 HEDGING PROGRAMS 
 The Company is exposed to market risk, such as changes in currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. To the extent the Company decides to manage the volatility related to these exposures, the Company may enter into various financial derivatives that are accounted for under the derivatives and hedging guidance. These transactions are governed by the Company's hedging policies which provide direction on acceptable hedging activities, including instrument type and acceptable counterparty exposure. 
 Upon inception, the Company formally documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items. At inception and quarterly thereafter, the Company formally assesses whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the cash flow or the fair value of the underlying exposures. The ineffective portion of the qualifying instrument is immediately recognized to earnings. The amount of ineffectiveness recognized was immaterial for all periods presented. The Company does not hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 
 CREDIT RISK 
 The Company is exposed to credit risk on the accounts receivable from its customers. In order to reduce this risk, the Company reviews new customers  credit history before granting credit and conducts regular reviews of existing customers  credit performance. As of September 30, 2016, one of Domtar s Pulp and Paper segment customers located in the United States represented 12% ($77 million) (2015   12% ($78 million)) of the Company s receivables. 
 The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties to its financial instruments. The Company attempts to minimize this exposure by entering into contracts with counterparties that are believed to be of high credit quality. Collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk is usually not obtained. The credit standing of counterparties is regularly monitored. 
 INTEREST RATE RISK 
 The Company is exposed to interest rate risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates on its cash and cash equivalents, bank indebtedness, bank credit facility and long-term debt. The Company s objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs. The Company may manage this interest rate exposure through the use of derivative instruments such as interest rate swap contracts, whereby it agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount.

 NOTE 3   DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (CONTINUED) 
   
  COST RISK  
 Cash flow hedges: 
 The Company purchases natural gas at the prevailing market price at the time of delivery. To reduce the impact on cash flow and earnings due to pricing volatility, the Company may utilize derivatives to fix the price of forecasted natural gas purchases. The changes in the fair value on qualifying instruments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss to the extent effective, and reclassified into Cost of sales in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Current contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted purchases over the next 60 months. 
   
 The following table presents the volumes under derivative financial instruments for natural gas contracts outstanding as of September 30, 2016 to hedge forecasted purchases: 

(2)    
 
 MMBTU: Millions of British thermal units    

 The natural gas derivative contracts were fully effective as of September 30, 2016. There were no amounts reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulting from hedge ineffectiveness (three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   nil). 
 FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK 
 Cash flow hedges: 
 The Company has manufacturing operations in the United States, Canada and Europe. As a result, it is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in Canada and Europe. Moreover, certain assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and are exposed to foreign currency movements. Accordingly, the Company s earnings are affected by increases or decreases in the value of the Canadian dollar and European currencies. The Company s European subsidiaries are also exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates on transactions denominated in a currency other than their Euro functional currency. Additionally, there has been, and may continue to be, volatility in currency exchange rates as a result of the United Kingdon s June 23, 2016 referendum in which voters approved the United Kingdom s exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as  Brexit.  The Company s risk management policy allows it to hedge a significant portion of its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for periods up to three years. The Company may use derivative financial instruments (currency options and foreign exchange forward contracts) to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Derivatives are used to hedge forecasted purchases in Canadian dollars by the Company s Canadian subsidiary over the next 24 months. Derivatives are used to hedge a portion of forecasted sales by its U.S. subsidiaries in Euros and in British pounds over the next 12 months. Derivatives are also used to hedge a portion of forecasted sales in British pounds and Norwegian krone and a portion of forecasted purchases in U.S. dollars and Swedish krona by its European subsidiaries over a period of between 12 to 24 months. Such derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. The changes in the fair value on qualifying instruments are included in

  Accumulated other comprehensive loss to the extent effective, and reclassified into Sales or Cost of sales in the period du  ring which the hedged transaction affects earnings.  
 The following table presents the currency values under significant currency positions pursuant to currency derivatives outstanding as of September 30, 2016 to hedge forecasted purchases and sales: 

The foreign exchange derivative contracts were fully effective as of September 30, 2016. There were no amounts reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulting from hedge ineffectiveness (three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 - nil). 
 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT 
 The accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures, establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels. A financial instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement. 

Level 1   
 
 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.    

Level 2   
 
 Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.    

Level 3   
 
 Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

 Fair value of the Company s derivatives are classified under Level 2 (inputs that are observable; directly or indirectly) as it is measured as follows:    

-   
 
 For currency derivatives: Fair value is measured using techniques derived from the Black-Scholes pricing model. Interest rates, forward market rates and volatility are used as inputs for such valuation techniques.    

-   
 
 For natural gas contracts: Fair value is measured using the discounted difference between contractual rates and quoted market future rates.    

(b)   
 
 ABN are reported at fair value utilizing Level 3 inputs. Fair value of ABN reported under Level 3 is based on the value of the collateral investments held in the conduit issuer, reduced by the negative value of credit default derivatives, with an additional discount applied for illiquidity. These ABN are held outside of the Company s pension plans.    

(c)   
 
 Fair value of the Company s long-term debt is measured by comparison to market prices of its debt. The Company s long-term debt is not carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. However, fair value disclosure is required. The carrying value of the Company s long-term debt is $1,372 million and $1,251 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.    

 Due to their short-term maturity, the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, bank indebtedness, trade and other payables and income and other taxes approximate their fair values.

 INCOME TAXES 
   
 In the third quarter of 2016, the Company s income tax expense was $16 million, consisting of a current income tax expense of $5 million and a deferred income tax expense of $11 million. This compares to an income tax benefit of $14 million in the third quarter of 2015, consisting of a current income tax expense of $4 million and a deferred income tax benefit of $18 million. The effective tax rate was 21% compared with an effective tax rate of 467% in the third quarter of 2015. The effective tax rates for both the third quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2015 were impacted by the finalization of certain estimates in connection with the filing of our 2015 and 2014 income tax returns, respectively. Additionally, the effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2015 was impacted by enacted law changes in several U.S. states and by the impairment of property, plant, and equipment charges occurring in a high-tax jurisdiction. 
   
 In the first nine months of 2016, the Company s income tax expense was $19 million, consisting of current income tax expense of $13 million and deferred income tax expense of $6 million. This compares to an income tax benefit of $6 million in the first nine months of 2015, consisting of a current income tax expense of $44 million and a deferred income tax benefit of $50 million. The  effective tax rate was 19% compared to an effective tax rate of (8)% in the first nine months of 2015.  The effective tax rates for both the first nine months of 2016 and the first nine months of 2015 were impacted by the finalization of certain estimates in connection with the filing of our 2015 and 2014 income tax returns, respectively. Additionally,  the effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2016 was impacted by the approval of a state tax credit in the U.S. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2015 was impacted by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the expiration of certain statutes of limitations, by enacted law changes in several U.S. states, and by the impairment of property, plant, and equipment charges occurring in a high-tax jurisdiction.

 CLOSURE AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS AND LIABILITY AND IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 
 The Company regularly reviews its overall production capacity with the objective of aligning its production capacity with anticipated long-term demand, which in some cases could result in closure or impairment costs being recorded in earnings. 
 Plymouth, North Carolina mill 
 On September 23, 2016, the Company announced a plan to optimize fluff pulp manufacturing at the Plymouth, North Carolina mill. The restructuring, which is expected to be completed by mid-2017, includes the permanent closure of a pulp dryer and idling of related assets, in addition to a workforce reduction of approximately 100 positions. The streamlining process will also right-size the mill to an annualized production target of approximately 380,000 metric tons of fluff pulp. The Company recorded $5 million of severance and termination costs under Closure and restructuring costs during the third quarter of 2016. 
 Ashdown, Arkansas mill 
 On December 10, 2014, the Company announced a project to convert a paper machine at the Ashdown, Arkansas mill to a high quality fluff pulp line used in absorbent applications such as baby diapers, feminine hygiene and adult incontinence products. The Company also invested in a pulp bale line that will provide flexibility to manufacture papergrade softwood pulp, contingent on market conditions. The conversion work commenced during the second quarter of 2016 and the production of bale softwood pulp began in the third quarter of 2016. The fluff qualification period is set to begin in the fourth quarter of 2016. The fluff pulp line will allow for the production of up to 516,000 metric tons of fluff pulp per year once the machine is in full operation. The project resulted in the permanent reduction of 364,000 short tons of annual uncoated freesheet production capacity on March 31, 2016. 
 The Company recorded $5 million and $29 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, of accelerated depreciation under Impairment of property, plant and equipment on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Income (Loss). The Company also recorded $5 million and $26 million of costs related to the fluff pulp conversion outage under Closure and restructuring costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company recorded $1 million of severance and termination costs under Closure and restructuring costs. 
 The Company recorded $20 million and $57 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, of accelerated depreciation under Impairment of property, plant and equipment on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Income (Loss). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded $1 million and $2 million, respectively, of severance and termination costs under Closure and restructuring costs. 
 Other costs 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, other costs related to previous and ongoing closures include nil and $1 million, respectively, of severance and termination costs related to Pulp and Paper. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, other costs related to previous and ongoing closures include nil and $1 million, respectively, of severance and termination costs related to Personal Care. 
 At September 30, 2016, the Company s provision for closure and restructuring costs is $8 million. This provision is comprised of severance and termination costs, all related to Pulp and Paper.

 SHAREHOLDERS  EQUITY 
 On February 22, 2016, May 3, 2016 and August 2, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.40, $0.415 and $0.415 per share, respectively, to be paid to holders of the Company s common stock. Total dividends of approximately $25 million, $26 million and $26 million, respectively, were paid on April 15, 2016, July 15, 2016 and October 17, 2016, respectively, to shareholders of record on April 4, 2016, July 5, 2016 and October 3, 2016, respectively. 
 On November 1, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.415 per share to be paid to holders of the Company s common stock. This dividend is to be paid on January 17, 2017, to shareholders of record on January 3, 2017. 
 STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM 
 The Company s Board of Directors has authorized a stock repurchase program (the  Program ) of up to $1.3 billion. Under the Program, the Company is authorized to repurchase from time to time shares of its outstanding common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of stock repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including the market conditions as well as corporate and regulatory considerations. The Program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time, and the Company has no obligation to repurchase any amount of its common stock under the Program. The Program has no set expiration date. The Company repurchases its common stock, from time to time, in part to reduce the dilutive effects of stock options and awards, and to improve shareholders  returns. 
 The Company makes open market purchases of its common stock using general corporate funds. Additionally, the Company may enter into structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions using general corporate funds in order to lower the average cost to acquire shares. The agreements would require the Company to make up-front payments to the counterparty financial institutions, which would result in either the receipt of stock at the beginning of the term of the agreements followed by a share adjustment at the maturity of the agreements, or the receipt of either stock or cash at the maturity of the agreements, depending upon the price of the stock. 
 During the first nine months of 2016, the Company repurchased 304,915 shares at an average price of $32.21 for a total cost of $10 million. 
 During the first nine months of 2015, the Company repurchased 1,210,932 shares at an average price of $41.40 for a total cost of $50 million. 
 Since the inception of the Program, the Company has repurchased 24,853,827 shares at an average price of $39.33 for a total cost of $977 million. All shares repurchased are recorded as Treasury stock on the Consolidated Balance Sheets under the par value method at $0.01 per share.

 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
 ENVIRONMENT 
 The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations enacted by federal, provincial, state and local authorities. 
 On February 16, 2010, the government of British Columbia issued a Remediation Order to Seaspan International Ltd. ( Seaspan ) and the Company, in order to define and implement an action plan to address soil, sediment and groundwater issues. Working with authorities, Seaspan and the Company selected a remedial plan and obtained permitting approval on May 14, 2015 from the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority. It is anticipated that construction will begin in 2017. The Company has recorded an environmental reserve to address its estimated exposure. The possible loss in excess of the reserve is not considered to be material for this matter. 
 The following table reflects changes in the reserve for environmental remediation and asset retirement obligations:

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) and/or various state agencies have notified the Company that it may be a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as  Superfund,  and similar state laws with respect to other hazardous waste sites as to which no proceedings have been instituted against the Company. The Company continues to take remedial action under its Care and Control Program at its former wood preserving sites, and at a number of operating sites, due to possible soil, sediment or groundwater contamination. 
 Climate change regulation 
   
 Various national and local laws and regulations have been established or are emerging in jurisdictions where the Company currently has, or may have in the future, manufacturing facilities or investments. The Company does not expect to be disproportionately affected by these measures compared with other pulp and paper producers located in these jurisdictions.  
   
 In the United States, EPA s Clean Power Plan requires states to develop compliance plans to reduce greenhouse gases ( GHG ) emissions beginning in 2022 from existing electric utilities. The Clean Power Plan requirements could result in significant changes to state energy resources and increase the cost of purchased energy in most states. The final rule is being litigated and on February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the Clean Power Plan until the litigation is resolved. Oral argument was held before an en banc panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on September 27, 2016, and a final decision is expected within months, although subsequent appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court are likely. The Company does not expect to be disproportionately affected compared with other pulp and paper producers located in the states where the Company operates.   
   
 The EPA is also developing a biogenic carbon accounting framework to account for carbon dioxide emissions from biomass fuels for Clean Air Act permitting and other regulatory purposes. The Company does not expect to be disproportionately affected by any future EPA measures compared with other pulp and paper producers in the United States.

 NOTE 15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED) 
   
  The Government of Canada is reviewing national policies to fur  ther GHG reductions and possibly establish a uniform national carbon price.    
   
 The province of Quebec has a GHG cap-and-trade system with reduction targets. British Columbia has a carbon tax that applies to the purchase of fossil fuels within the province. The province of Ontario has finalized a cap-and-trade program with the first compliance period beginning January 1, 2017 through 2020. The Company does not expect to be disproportionately affected compared to the other large pulp and paper producers located in these provinces. 
 CONTINGENCIES 
 In the normal course of operations, the Company becomes involved in various legal actions mostly related to contract disputes, patent infringements, environmental and product warranty claims, and labor issues. While the final outcome with respect to actions outstanding or pending at September 30, 2016, cannot be predicted with certainty, it is management s opinion that their resolution will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Spanish Competition Investigation 
   
 In September 2014, following preliminary inquiries commenced in January 2014, Spain s National Commission of Markets and Competition ( CNMC ) initiated a formal investigation of alleged violations of Spanish competition laws in the market for heavy adult incontinence products in Spain. 
   
 On October 15, 2015, the Competition Directorate of the CNMC filed a Statement of Objections against a number of industry participants alleging the existence of a series of agreements between manufacturers, distributors and pharmacists to fix prices and to allocate margins for heavy adult incontinence products within the pharmacy channel   in Spain during the period from December 1996 through January 2014. Among the parties named in the Statement of Objections are Indas, which the Company acquired in January 2014, and two of its affiliates. 
   
 On January 4, 2016, the Competition Directorate issued a proposed decision confirming the allegations of the Statement of Objections. The proposed decision recommended the imposition of fines on the parties without recommending the amount of any fines. The Company recorded a  0.2 million ($0.2 million) provision in the fourth quarter of 2015 in Other operating loss (income), net.  
   
 On May 26, 2016, the CNMC rendered its final decision, which declared that a number of manufacturers of adult heavy incontinence products, the sector association and certain individuals participated in price fixing during the period from December 1996 through January 2014. Indas and one of its subsidiaries were fined a total of  13.5 million ($14.9 million) for their participation. A provision was recorded in the second quarter of 2016 in the amount of  13.3 million ($14.7 million) in Other operating loss (income), net.  
   
 The sellers of Indas made representations and warranties to the Company in the purchase agreement regarding, among other things, Indas  and its subsidiary s compliance with competition laws. The liability retained by the sellers is backed by a retained purchase price of  3 million ($3.3 million) and bank guarantees of  9 million ($9.9 million). 
   
 On June 27, 2016, in light of the CNMC decision, the sellers, in terms of their indemnity obligations, have agreed to the appropriation by the Company of the retained purchase price and the release of the bank guarantees. Accordingly, a recovery of  12 million ($13.2 million) was recorded in the second quarter of 2016 and included in Other operating loss (income), net. 
   
 In July 2016, the fines were paid and Indas and two of its affiliates named in the final decision appealed the decision to the Spanish courts. 
   
 The Company purchased limited insurance coverage with respect to the purchase agreement, and will seek to recover the remaining  1.5 million ($1.7 million) under the insurance policy. Any recovery from the insurers would be recorded in the period when the proceeds are received.

  INDEMNIFICATIONS  
 In the normal course of business, the Company offers indemnifications relating to the sale of its businesses and real estate. In general, these indemnifications may relate to claims from past business operations, the failure to abide by covenants and the breach of representations and warranties included in the sales agreements. Typically, such representations and warranties relate to taxation, environmental, product and employee matters. The terms of these indemnification agreements are generally for an unlimited period of time. At September 30, 2016, the Company is unable to estimate the potential maximum liabilities for these types of indemnification guarantees as the amounts are contingent upon the outcome of future events, the nature and likelihood of which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly, no provision has been recorded. These indemnifications have not yielded a significant expense in the past. 
 Pension Plans 
 The Company has indemnified and held harmless the trustees of its pension funds, and the respective officers, directors, employees and agents of such trustees, from any and all costs and expenses arising out of the performance of their obligations under the relevant trust agreements, including in respect of their reliance on authorized instructions from the Company or for failing to act in the absence of authorized instructions. These indemnifications survive the termination of such agreements. At September 30, 2016, the Company has not recorded a liability associated with these indemnifications, as it does not expect to make any payments pertaining to these indemnifications.

RECENT DEVELOPMENT  
 Effective October 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares of Home Delivery Incontinent Supplies Co. ( HDIS ), a leading national direct-to-consumer provider of adult incontinence and related products. The purchase price was $53 million, net of cash acquired of $3 million and includes a potential earn-out payment of up to $10 million.  
 Headquartered in Olivette, Missouri, HDIS provides customers with high-quality products and a personalized service for all of their incontinence needs. HDIS has annual revenues of approximately $65 million, operates a 200,000 square foot distribution center in Olivette, Missouri, as well as two retail locations in Texarkana, Arkansas and Daytona Beach, Florida and employs approximately 240 people. The results of HDIS  operations will be included in the Personal Care reportable segment starting October 1, 2016.  
 OUTLOOK 
   
 The fourth quarter will be negatively impacted by seasonality and mix in paper. We expect some short-term pricing volatility in pulp, while raw material unit costs are expected to increase, notably for wood, energy and chemicals. Our Personal Care results are expected to continue to benefit from the new customer wins, market growth and cost savings from the new manufacturing platform. 
 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND SEGMENT REVIEW 
 This section presents a discussion and analysis of our third quarter and first nine months of 2016 and 2015 sales, operating income (loss) and other information relevant to the understanding of our results of operations. 

43 

(a)   
 
 Includes raw materials (such as fiber, chemicals, nonwovens and super absorbent polymers) and energy expenses.    

(b)   
 
 Includes maintenance, freight costs, selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses and other costs.    

(c)   
 
 In the third quarter of 2016, we recorded $5 million of accelerated depreciation related to the conversion of a paper machine to a high quality fluff pulp line at our Ashdown mill, compared to $20 million recorded in the third quarter of 2015. Depreciation charges were lower by $2 million in the third quarter of 2016, excluding foreign currency impact.    

(d)   
 
 In the third quarter of 2016, restructuring charges related to the conversion at Ashdown described above ($5 million) and the closure of a pulp dryer and idling of related assets at our Plymouth mill ($5 million) related to our plan to optimize fluff pulp manufacturing. In the third quarter of 2015, we incurred restructuring charges of $1 million.    

 (e) 

Third quarter of 2016 operating expenses/income includes:   
 
  Third quarter of 2015 operating expenses/income includes:   

- Foreign currency loss on working capital items ($1 million) 
 - Other income ($1 million) 

- Environmental provision ($4 million) 
 - Foreign currency gain on working capital items ($3 million) 
 - Bad debt expense recovery ($1 million) 

Commentary   Third quarter of 2016 compared to Third quarter of 2015 
 Interest Expense, net 
 We incurred $17 million of net interest expense in the third quarter of 2016, a decrease of $47 million compared to net interest expense of $64 million in the third quarter of 2015. This decrease was mostly due to a premium of $42 million paid in August 2015 on the partial repayment of the 9.5% Notes due 2016 and of the 10.75% Notes due 2017 as well as a decrease in interest expense as a result of the partial repayment. In addition, interest expense also decreased due to the repayment at maturity of the 7.125% Notes due in August 2015 as well as the maturity of the 9.5% Notes in August 2016. This decrease was partially offset by interest expense related to borrowing under the Term Loan Agreement drawn down in the third quarter of 2015. 
 Income Taxes 
 In the third quarter of 2016, our income tax expense was $16 million, consisting of current income tax expense of $5 million and a deferred income tax expense of $11 million. This compares to an income tax benefit of $14 million in the third quarter of 2015, consisting of a current income tax expense of $4 million and a deferred income tax benefit of $18 million. We made income tax payments, net of refunds, of $10 million during the third quarter of 2016. Our effective tax rate was 21% compared with an effective tax rate of 467% in the third quarter of 2015.  The effective tax rates for both the third quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2015 were impacted by the finalization of certain estimates in connection with the filing of our 2015 and 2014 income tax returns,  
 44 

respectively. Additionally, the effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2015 was impact  ed by enacted law changes in several U.S. states and by the impairment of property, plant, and equipment charges occurring in a high-tax jurisdiction.  

(a)   
 
 Includes raw materials (such as fiber, chemicals, nonwovens and super absorbent polymers) and energy expenses.    

(b)   
 
 Includes maintenance, freight costs, SG A expenses and other costs.    

(c)   
 
 In the first nine months of 2016, we recorded $29 million of accelerated depreciation related to the conversion of a paper machine to a high quality fluff pulp line at our Ashdown mill, compared to $57 million recorded in the first nine months of 2015. Depreciation charges were lower by $5 million in the first nine months of 2016, excluding foreign currency impact.    

(d)   
 
 In the first nine months of 2016, we incurred restructuring charges of $33 million mostly related to the conversion at Ashdown described above and the closure of a pulp dryer and idling of related assets at our Plymouth mill, related to our plan to optimize fluff pulp manufacturing. This compares to restructuring charges of $3 million in the first nine months of 2015.    

 (e) 

First nine months of 2016 operating expenses/income includes:   
 
  First nine months of 2015 operating expenses/income includes:

- Gain on sale of property, plant and equipment ($15 million) 
 - Bad debt expense ($4 million) 
 - Environmental provision ($4 million) 
 - Foreign currency gain on working capital items ($3 million) 
 - Other expense ($2 million) 

Commentary   First nine months of 2016 compared to first nine months of 2015 
 Interest Expense, net 
 We incurred $49 million of net interest expense in the first nine months of 2016, a decrease of $66 million compared to net interest expense of $115 million in the first nine months of 2015. This decrease was mostly due to a premium of $42 million paid in August 2015 on the partial repayment of the 9.5% Notes due 2016 and on the 10.75% Notes due 2017 as well as a decrease in interest expense on these Notes as a result of the partial repayment. In addition, interest expense also decreased due to the repayment at maturity of the 7.125% Notes due in August 2015 as well as the maturity of the 9.5% Notes in August 2016. This decrease was partially offset by interest expense related to borrowing under the Term Loan Agreement drawn down in the third quarter of 2015. 
 Income Taxes 
 In the first nine months of 2016, our income tax expense was $19 million, consisting of current income tax expense of $13 million and a deferred income tax expense of $6 million. This compares to an income tax benefit of $6 million in the first nine months of 2015, consisting of a current income tax expense of $44 million and a deferred income tax benefit of $50 million.  We made income tax payments, net of refunds, of $37 million during the first nine months of 2016. Our effective tax rate was 19% compared to an effective tax rate of -8% in the first nine months of 2015.  The effective tax rates for both the first nine months of 2016 and the first nine months of 2015 were impacted by the finalization of certain estimates in connection with the filing of our 2015 and 2014 income tax returns, respectively. Additionally,  the effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2016 was impacted by the approval of a state tax credit in the U.S. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2015 was impacted by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the expiration of certain statutes of limitations, by enacted law changes in several U.S. states, and by the impairment of property, plant, and equipment charges occurring in a high-tax jurisdiction.

Commentary   Segment Review  
 Pulp and Paper Segment 
 Sales in our Pulp and Paper segment decreased by $38 million, or 3%, when compared to sales in the third quarter of 2015. This decrease in sales is mostly due to a 2% decrease in net average selling prices for pulp and paper as well as a decrease in our paper sales volumes, partially offset by an increase in our pulp sales volumes.  
 Operating income in our Pulp and Paper segment amounted to $89 million in the third quarter of 2016, an increase of $35 million, when compared to operating income of $54 million in the third quarter of 2015. Our results were positively impacted by lower maintenance costs due mostly to the timing of maintenance outages, lower accelerated depreciation charges, lower raw materials costs, lower hedging losses, lower freight costs and an increase in our pulp sales volume. This increase was partially offset by lower average selling prices for pulp and paper, higher restructuring charges related to the Ashdown conversion and the closure of a pulp dryer and idling of related assets at our Plymouth mill, higher SG A costs and a decrease in our paper sales volume. 
 Sales in our Pulp and Paper segment decreased by $155 million, or 5%, when compared to sales in the first nine months of 2015. This decrease in sales is mostly due to a 4% decrease in net average selling prices for pulp and paper as well as a decrease in our paper sales volumes, partially offset by an increase in our pulp sales volumes.  
 Operating income in our Pulp and Paper segment amounted to $143 million in the first nine months of 2016, a decrease of $41 million, when compared to operating income of $184 million in the first nine months of 2015. Our results were negatively impacted by lower average selling prices for pulp and paper, higher restructuring charges related to the Ashdown conversion and the closure of a pulp dryer and idling of related assets at our Plymouth mill, a decrease in our paper sales volume, the gain on sale of property, plant and equipment in Q2 2015, lower productivity, higher compensation costs and higher SG A costs. This decrease was partially offset by lower raw materials costs, favorable currency impacts (net of hedging), lower freight costs, lower accelerated depreciation charges, an increase in pulp sales volume and lower depreciation charges. 
 Personal Care Segment   
 Sales in our Personal Care segment increased by $17 million, or 8% when compared to sales in the third quarter of 2015. This increase in sales was driven by higher sales volume/mix of 11%, partially offset by lower selling prices of approximately 3%. Foreign currency impacts, net of hedging, were flat when compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
 Operating income decreased by $3 million, or 17%, in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. Our results were negatively impacted by lower selling prices, higher compensation costs and SG A costs. This decrease was partially offset by favorable input costs, mostly due to favorable raw material pricing related to indices as well as favorable negotiated procurement savings and an increase in sales volume. 
 Sales in our Personal Care segment increased by $27 million, or 4%, when compared to sales in the first nine months of 2015. This increase in sales was driven by higher sales volume/mix of 7% and was partially offset by lower selling prices of approximately 3%. Foreign currency impacts, net of hedging, were relatively flat when compared to the first nine months of 2015. 
 Operating income decreased by $1 million, or 2%, in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015. Our results were negatively impacted by lower selling prices, higher compensation costs and higher SG A costs. This decrease was partially offset by favorable input costs, mostly due to favorable raw material pricing, lower manufacturing costs and an increase in sales volume.  
 STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE 
 For the first nine months of 2016, stock-based compensation expense recognized in our results of operations was $11 million for all outstanding awards which includes the mark-to-market recovery related to liability awards of $2 million. This compares to a stock-based compensation expense of $9 million for all outstanding awards which includes the mark-to-market recovery related to liability awards of $3 million in the first nine months of 2015. Compensation costs for performance awards are based on management s best estimate of the final performance measurement.  
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our principal cash requirements are for ongoing operating costs, pension contributions, working capital and capital expenditures, as well as principal and interest payments on our debt. We expect to fund our liquidity needs primarily with internally generated funds  
 46 

from our operations and, to the extent necessary, through borrowings under our contractually committed $700 million credit facility, of which $590 million is currently undrawn and available, or through our $1  50 million receivables securitization facility, of which $2 million is currently undrawn and available. Under adverse market conditions, there can be no assurance that these agreements would be available or sufficient. See  Capital Resources  below.  
 Our ability to make payments on the requirements mentioned above will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. Our credit and receivable securitization facilities and debt indentures impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could limit our ability to respond to market conditions, to provide for unanticipated capital investments or to take advantage of business opportunities. 
 A portion of our cash is held outside the U.S. by foreign subsidiaries. The earnings of the foreign subsidiaries, which reflect full provision for local income taxes, are currently indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. We do not intend on repatriating those funds and no provision is made for income taxes that would be payable upon the distribution of earnings from foreign subsidiaries as computation of these amounts is not practicable. 
 The June 23, 2016 referendum by British voters to exit the European Union ( Brexit ) adversely impacted global markets, including currencies, and resulted in a sharp decline in the value of the British pound, as compared to the U.S. dollar and other currencies. Volatility in exchange rates is expected to continue in the short term as the United Kingdom (U.K.) negotiates its exit from the European Union. A weaker British pound compared to the U.S. dollar during a reporting period causes local currency results of our U.K. sales to be translated into fewer U.S. dollars. For the year ended December 31, 2015, net sales in the U.K. constituted 1% of our consolidated net sales (for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, net sales in the U.K. constituted 2% or our consolidated sales). In the longer term, any impact from Brexit on our U.K. sales will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory, and other negotiations. The macroeconomic impact on our results of operations from this vote remains unknown. To date, the foreign exchange impact has been minimal since  we currently hedge a portion of our British Pound Sterling exposure through the second quarter of fiscal 2018, thus reducing our currency risk.   
 Operating Activities 
 Our operating cash flow requirements are primarily for salaries and benefits, the purchase of fiber, energy and raw materials and other expenses such as property taxes. 
 Cash flows provided from operating activities totaled $310 million in the first nine months of 2016, a $6 million decrease compared to cash flows provided from operating activities of $316 million in the first nine months of 2015. This decrease in cash flows provided from operating activities is primarily due an increase in working capital requirements in the first nine months of 2016 when compared to the first nine months of 2015 as well as lower profitability. We made income tax payments, net of refunds, of $37 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared to income tax payments, net of refunds of $16 million during the first nine months of 2015.  
 Investing Activities 
 Cash flows used for investing activities in the first nine months of 2016 amounted to $302 million, a $144 million increase compared to cash flows used for investing activities of $158 million in the first nine months of 2015. 
 The use of cash in the first nine months of 2016 was attributable to additions to property, plant and equipment of $302 million.  
 The use of cash in the first nine months of 2015 was attributable to additions to property, plant and equipment of $202 million. The use of cash was partially offset by the proceeds from the disposal of assets, totaling $35 million. During the first nine months of 2015, we sold $9 million of asset-backed notes and received proceeds of $26 million (CDN $32 million) from the sale of Gatineau assets. 
 Our capital expenditures for 2016 are expected to be approximately between $340 million and $350 million. 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash flows provided from financing activities totaled $32 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared to cash flows used for financing activities of $197 million in the first nine months of 2015. 
 The cash flows provided from financing activities in the first nine months of 2016 was primarily the result of the net proceeds from borrowings under our credit facilities (revolver and receivable securitization) ($120 million) and an increase in our bank indebtedness ($1 million). These were partially offset by dividend payments ($76 million) and the repurchase of our common stock ($10 million).  
 47 

The use of cash in the   first nine months of 2015 was primarily the result of dividend payments ($75 million), a net repayment of our long-term debt ($64 million), the repurchase of our common stock ($50 million), and a reduction in our bank indebtedness ($9 million)  .   
 Capital Resources 
 Net indebtedness, consisting of bank indebtedness and long-term debt, net of cash and cash equivalents, was $1,204 million as of September 30, 2016 compared to $1,125 million as of December 31, 2015. 
 Notes Redemption 
 Our 9.5% Notes, in the aggregate principal amount of $39 million, matured on August 1, 2016. 
 In the third quarter of 2015, we redeemed $55 million in aggregate principal amount of our 9.5% Notes due 2016, representing approximately 59% of the outstanding notes, and $215 million in aggregate principal amount of our 10.75% Notes due 2017, representing approximately 77% of the outstanding notes. The redemption price was equal to 100% of the principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, plus the applicable make-whole premium.  
 In addition, our 7.125% notes in the aggregate principal amount of $167 million matured on August 15, 2015.   
 The above-noted redemptions and repayment of notes were funded through a combination of cash on hand, borrowings under our credit facilities and proceeds from a new $300 million 10-year term loan agreement with a syndicate of bank lenders. 
   
 Term Loan 
   
 In the third quarter of 2015, a wholly owned subsidiary of Domtar entered into a $300 million Term Loan Agreement that matures on July 20, 2025. The facility was fully drawn down on August 19, 2015. On August 18, 2016, we entered into an amendment (the  Amendment ) to our Term Loan Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, certain of our subsidiaries were designated as  insignificant subsidiaries  and were released from their guarantees of the borrower s obligations under the Term Loan Agreement, as amended by the Amendment. Borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.875%. The Term Loan Agreement contains customary covenants, including two financial covenants: (i) an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the Term Loan Agreement, that must be maintained at a level of not less than 3 to 1 and (ii) a leverage ratio, as defined in the Term Loan Agreement that must be maintained at a level of not greater than 3.75 to 1. At September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with these financial covenants. 
 All borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement are unsecured. The Company and certain domestic subsidiaries of the Company unconditionally guarantee any obligations under the Term Loan Agreement. 
 Bank Facility 
 On August 18, 2016, we amended and restated our existing Credit Agreement. The amended 2016 Credit Agreement matures on August 18, 2021.  
 The maximum aggregate amount of availability under the 2016 Credit Agreement is $700 million, an increase of $100 million from the existing Credit Agreement of $600 million. The terms of the 2016 Credit Agreement are generally consistent with the terms of the existing Credit Agreement. 
 The 2016 Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility (including a letter of credit sub-facility and a swingline sub-facility), which may be borrowed in U.S. Dollars, Canadian Dollars and Euros. We may increase the maximum aggregate amount of availability under the 2016 Credit Agreement by up to $400 million, borrow this increased amount as a term loan, and extend the final maturity of the 2016 Credit Agreement by one year, subject to the agreement of applicable lenders. 
 Borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement bear interest at the LIBOR, EURIBOR or the Canadian bankers  acceptance or prime rates as applicable, plus a margin linked to our credit rating at the time of borrowing. In addition, we pay facility fees quarterly at rates dependent on our credit ratings. 
 The 2016 Credit Agreement contains customary covenants, including two financial covenants: (i) an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the 2016 Credit Agreement, that must be maintained at a level of not less than 3 to 1 and (ii) a leverage ratio, as defined in the 2016 Credit Agreement that must be maintained at a level of not greater than 3.75 to 1 (or 4.00 to 1 upon the occurrence of certain  
 48 

qualifying material acquisitions). At September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with these financial covenants, and $110 million was borrowed under the 2016 Credit Agreement (September 30, 2015   $75   million). At September 30, 2016, we had no outstanding letters of credit under this 2016 Credit Agreement (September 30, 2015   nil). At September 30, 2016, we had $590 million unused and available under this 2016 Credit Agreement.  
   
 All borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement are unsecured. The Company and certain domestic subsidiaries of the Company unconditionally guarantee any obligations from time to time arising under the Credit Agreement. 
 Receivables Securitization 
 We have a $150 million receivables securitization facility that matures in March 2019. 
 At September 30, 2016, borrowings under the receivables securitization facility amounted to $100 million and $48 million of letters of credit under the program (September 30, 2015   nil and $44 million, respectively). The program contains certain termination events, which include, but are not limited to, matters related to receivable performance, certain defaults occurring under the credit facility or our failure to repay or satisfy material obligations. At September 30, 2016, we had $2 million unused and available under the accounts receivable securitization facility. 
 Common Stock 
 On February 22, 2016, May 3, 2016 and August 2, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.40, $0.415 and $0.415 per share, respectively, to be paid to holders of our common stock. Total dividends of approximately $25 million, $26 million and $26 million, respectively, were paid on April 15, 2016, July 15, 2016 and October 17, 2016, respectively, to shareholders of record on April 4, 2016, July 5, 2016 and October 3, 2016 respectively.   
 On November 1, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.415 per share to be paid to holders of our common stock. This dividend is to be paid on January 17, 2017, to shareholders of record on January 3, 2017. 
 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 In the normal course of business, we finance certain of our activities off balance sheet through operating leases. 
 GUARANTEES 
 Indemnifications 
 In the normal course of business, we offer indemnifications relating to the sale of our businesses and real estate. In general, these indemnifications may relate to claims from past business operations, the failure to abide by covenants and the breach of representations and warranties included in sales agreements. Typically, such representations and warranties relate to taxation, environmental, product and employee matters. The terms of these indemnification agreements are generally for an unlimited period of time. At September 30, 2016, we were unable to estimate the potential maximum liabilities for these types of indemnification guarantees as the amounts are contingent upon the outcome of future events, the nature and likelihood of which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly, no provision has been recorded. These indemnifications have not yielded significant expenses in the past. 
 Pension Plans 
 We have indemnified and held harmless the trustees of our pension funds, and the respective officers, directors, employees and agents of such trustees, from any and all costs and expenses arising out of the performance of their obligations under the relevant trust agreements, including in respect of their reliance on authorized instructions from us or for failing to act in the absence of authorized instructions. These indemnifications survive the termination of such agreements. At September 30, 2016, we have not recorded a liability associated with these indemnifications, as we do not expect to make any payments pertaining to these indemnifications.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES  
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates, assumptions and choices amongst acceptable accounting methods that affect our reported results of operations and financial position. Critical accounting estimates pertain to matters that contain a significant level of management estimates about future events, encompass the most complex and subjective judgments and are subject to a fair degree of measurement uncertainty. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates, including those related to environmental matters and asset retirement obligations, impairment and useful lives of long-lived assets, closure and restructuring costs, pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, income taxes, business combinations and contingencies. These critical accounting estimates and policies have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe these accounting policies, and others, should be reviewed as they are essential to understanding our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 There has not been any material change to our policies since December 31, 2015. For more details on critical accounting policies, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

 You are cautioned not to unduly rely on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made, when evaluating the information presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Unless specifically required by law, Domtar Corporation disclaims any obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements to reflect new events or circumstances. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Except as presented below, there have been no material changes i n our exposure to market risk since December 31, 2015. A full discussion on Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk, is found in Note 3  Derivatives and Hedging Activities and Fair Value Measurement,  of the financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
   
 FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK 
 Cash flow hedges 
 We have manufacturing operations in the United States, Canada and Europe. As a result, we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in Canada and Europe. Moreover, certain assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and are exposed to foreign currency movements. Accordingly, our earnings are affected by increases or decreases in the value of the Canadian dollar and European currencies. Our European subsidiaries are also exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates on transactions denominated in a currency other than their Euro functional currency. Additionally, there has been, and may continue to be, volatility in currency exchange rates as a result of the United Kingdom's June 23, 2016 referendum in which voters approved the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as  Brexit.  Our risk management policy allows us to hedge a significant portion of the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for periods up to three years. We may use derivative financial instruments (currency options and foreign exchange forward contracts) to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Derivatives are used to hedge a portion of forecasted purchases in Canadian dollars by our Canadian subsidiary over the next 24 months. Derivatives are also used to hedge a portion of forecasted sales by our U.S. subsidiaries in Euros and in British pounds over the next 12 months. Derivatives are also used to hedge a portion of forecasted sales in British pounds and Norwegian krone and a portion of forecasted purchases in U.S. dollars and Swedish krona by our European subsidiaries over a periods of between 12 to 24 months. Such derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. The changes in the fair value on qualifying instruments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss to the extent effective, and reclassified into Sales or Cost of sales in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of September 30, 2016, an evaluation was performed by members of management, at the direction and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
   
 Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report.

P  ART I    I OTHER   INFORMATION  
     ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 See Note 15  Commitments and Contingencies  of the financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the discussion regarding legal proceedings. 
 For a description of previously reported legal proceedings refer to Part I, Item 3,  Legal Proceedings,  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
     ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
   
 Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, contains important risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement.  Except as presented below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors described in  our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
 Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial results or condition. 
 In addition to environmental laws, the Company s business and operations are subject to a broad range of other laws and regulations in the United States and Canada as well as other jurisdictions in which the Company operate, including antitrust and competition laws, occupational health and safety laws, healthcare reimbursement laws, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and employment laws. Many of these laws and regulations are complex and subject to evolving and differing interpretation. If the Company is determined to have violated any such laws or regulations, whether inadvertently or willfully, it may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including substantial fines, loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs, claims for damages by third parties or fines or monetary penalties which may have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For additional information, refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 22  Commitments and Contingencies  under the caption  Spanish Competition Investigation  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
 The efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected by disruptions to our Information Technology (IT) Services. 
 The Company s information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, serve an important role in the efficient operation of its business. The protection of customer, employee and company data is critical to its business. This role includes ordering and managing materials from suppliers, managing its inventory, converting materials to finished products, facilitating order entry and fulfillment and processing of transactions, summarizing and reporting its financial results, facilitating internal and external communications, administering human resources functions, retaining certain personal information and providing other processes necessary to manage its business. The Company is exposed to the risk of cyber incidents in the normal course of business. Cyber incidents may be deliberate attacks for the theft of intellectual property or other sensitive information or may be the result of unintentional events. Like most companies, the Company's information technology systems may be vulnerable to interruption due to a variety of events beyond the Company's control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, power and/or telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. The Company has technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans in place to mitigate the Company's risk to these vulnerabilities, including protection of confidential or personal information, but these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to ensure that the Company's operations are not disrupted. The Company s IT systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, phishing and other cyber-incidents. The Company cannot guarantee that its security efforts will prevent breaches or breakdowns to its IT systems or those of its third party providers. Potential consequences of a material cyber incident, which could result in confidential or personal information being accessed, obtained, damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons, include damage to the Company s reputation, litigation, inefficiencies or production downtimes and increased cyber security protection and remediation costs. Such consequences could have a negative impact on the Company s ability to meet customers  orders, resulting in a delay or decrease to its revenue and a reduction to its operating margins. 
 Conditions in the global political and economic environment, including the global capital and credit markets, can adversely affect the Company s business, results of operations and financial position. 
 A significant or prolonged downturn in the general economic environment may affect the Company s sales and profitability. The Company has exposure to counterparties with which it routinely executes transactions. Such counterparties include commercial banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions, some of which may be exposed to bankruptcy or liquidity risks. A bankruptcy or illiquidity event by one of its significant counterparties may materially and adversely affect the Company s access to capital, future business and results of operations. 
 52 

In addition, the Company s customers and suppliers may be adversely affected by severe economic conditions. This could result   in reduced demand for its products or its inability to obtain necessary supplies at reasonable costs,     or at all.  
 The Company may be negatively impacted by political issues or crises in individual countries or regions, including sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration in the credit worthiness of local governments. 
 For example, on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum in which a majority of voters voted to exit the European Union ( Brexit ). The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the United Kingdom makes to retain access to European Union markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Brexit could adversely affect European and global economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial markets. Any of these effects of Brexit, and others the Company cannot anticipate, may have a negative effect and may adversely affect the Company s business. 
 Certain countries in Europe provide medicare coverage for adult incontinence products. The governments of these countries may decide to no longer reimburse part or all of the costs of adult incontinence products, and this may have a negative impact on the Company s profitability in the future. 
   
 The Company is affected by changes in currency exchange rates. 
 The Company has manufacturing operations in the United States, Canada, Sweden and Spain. As a result, it is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in Canada and Europe. Moreover, certain assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and are exposed to foreign currency movements. As a result, the Company s earnings are affected by increases or decreases in the value of the Canadian dollar and of other European currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The Company s European subsidiaries are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates on transactions denominated in a different currency than its Euro functional currency. Additionally, there has been, and may continue to be, volatility in currency exchange rates as a result of the United Kingdom's June 23, 2016 referendum in which voters approved the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union. The Company s risk management policy allows it to hedge a significant portion of its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for periods up to three years. The Company may use derivative instruments (currency options and foreign exchange forward contracts) to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or to designate them as hedging instruments in order to hedge the subsidiary s cash flow risk for purposes of the Consolidated Financial Statements. There can be no assurance that the Company will be protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations. This factor could adversely affect the Company s financial results. 
   
     ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 Share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program was as follows during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016: 

(1)  During the third quarter of 2016, we did not repurchase any shares under our stock repurchase program (the  Program ). We currently have $323 million of remaining availability under our Program. The Program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time and we have no obligation to repurchase any amount of our common stock under the Program. The Program has no set expiration date. We repurchase our common stock, from time to time, in part to reduce the dilutive effects of our stock options and awards and to improve shareholders  returns. The timing and amount of stock repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, availability under the program as well as corporate and regulatory considerations. All shares repurchased are recorded as Treasury stock on the Consolidated Balance Sheets under the par value method at $0.01 per share.

   For purposes of the foregoing, (i) if either Moody s or S P shall not have in effect a Corporate Rating (other than by reason of the circumstances referred to in the penultimate sentence of this definition), then such rating agency shall be deemed to have established a rating in Level V; (ii) if the Corporate Ratings established or deemed to have been established by Moody s and S P shall fall within different Levels, the pricing shall be based on the higher of the two ratings unless one of the two ratings is two or more Levels lower than the other, in which case the pricing shall be determined by reference to the Level next below that of the higher of the two ratings; and (iii) if the Corporate Rating established or deemed to have been established by Moody s or S P shall be changed (other than as a result of a change in the rating system of Moody s or S P), such change shall be effective as of the date on which it is first announced by the applicable rating agency, irrespective of when notice of such change shall have been furnished by the Borrowers to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders.  Each change in pricing shall  

4 
  apply during the period commencing on the effective date of such change and ending on the date immediately preceding the effective date of the next such change.

Subject to the execution by the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and such Lender of a duly completed Extension Agreement, the Termination Date applicable to the Revolving Commitment of each Lender so affirmatively notifying the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent shall be extended for the period specified above;    provided    that (x) no Termination Date of any Lender shall be extended unless Lenders having at least 50% in aggregate amount of the Revolving Commitments in effect at the time any such extension is requested shall have elected so to extend their Revolving Commitments, (y) on the date of any such extension of the Termination Date, each of the representations and warranties made by each Borrower herein shall be true and correct in all material respects, on and as of such date as if made on and as of such date, except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties shall have been true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date) and (z) no Termination Date of any Lender shall be extended if a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.  Any Lender which does not give such notice to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have elected not to extend as requested, and the Revolving Commitment of each non-extending Lender shall terminate on the earlier of (x) the Termination Date and (y) the date on which a Change of Control shall occur, determined without giving effect to such requested extension.  The Borrowers, at their discretion, will have the right at any time pursuant to Section 10.1(b) to seek a substitute bank or banks for any Lender which does not elect to extend its Revolving Commitment.  Following any such extension, the L/C Obligations shall continue to be held ratably among the Tranche 1 Revolving Lenders, but on the Termination Date as applicable to any non-extending Revolving Lender, the L/C Obligations of such non-extending Revolving Lender shall be ratably reallocated, to the extent of the Available Revolving Commitments of the extending Tranche 1 Revolving Lenders to the extending Tranche 1 Revolving Lenders (without regard to whether the conditions set forth

No Contract Period shall extend beyond the Termination Date.  If such Contract Period would otherwise end on a day that is not a Business Day, such Contract Period shall end on the next preceding day that is a Business Day.  
 (b)  Discount Rate  .  On each Borrowing Date on which Bankers  Acceptances are to be accepted, the Administrative Agent shall advise the applicable Borrower as to the Administrative Agent s determination of the applicable Discount Rate for the Bankers  Acceptances which any of the Tranche 1 Revolving Lenders have agreed to purchase.  
 (c)  Purchase  .  Each Tranche 1 Revolving Lender agrees to purchase a Bankers  Acceptance accepted by it.  The applicable Borrower shall sell, and such Tranche 1 Revolving Lender shall purchase, the Bankers  Acceptance at the applicable Discount Rate.  Such Tranche 1 Revolving Lender shall provide to the relevant Funding Office the Discount Proceeds less the Acceptance Fee payable by such Borrower with respect to such Bankers  Acceptance.  Such proceeds will then be made available to such Borrower by the Administrative Agent crediting an account as directed by such Borrower with the aggregate of the amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by such Tranche 1 Revolving Lenders and in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent.  
 (d)  Sale  .  Each Tranche 1 Revolving Lender may from time to time hold, sell, rediscount or otherwise dispose of any or all Bankers  Acceptances accepted and purchased by it.  
   (e)  Power of Attorney for the Execution of Bankers  Acceptances  .  To facilitate borrowings under the Tranche 1 Revolving Commitments by way of BAs, each Borrower hereby appoints each Tranche 1 Revolving Lender as its attorney to sign and endorse on its behalf, in handwriting or by facsimile or mechanical signature as and when deemed necessary by such Tranche 1 Revolving Lender, blank forms of BAs.  In this respect, it is each Tranche 1 Revolving Lender s responsibility to maintain an adequate supply of blank forms of BAs for acceptance under this Agreement.  Each Borrower recognizes and agrees that all BAs required to be accepted and purchased by any Tranche 1 Revolving Lender and which are signed and/or endorsed on its behalf by a Tranche 1 Revolving Lender shall bind such Borrower as fully and effectually as if signed in the handwriting of and duly issued by the proper signing officers of such Borrower.  Each Tranche 1 Revolving Lender is hereby authorized to issue such BAs endorsed in blank in such face amounts as may be determined by such Tranche 1 Revolving Lender;   provided   that the aggregate amount thereof is equal to the aggregate amount of BAs required to be accepted and purchased by such Tranche 1 Revolving Lender.  No Tranche 1 Revolving Lender shall be liable for any damage, loss or other claim arising by reason of any loss or improper use of any such instrument except the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Tranche 1 Revolving Lender or its officers, employees, agents or representatives.  On request by a Borrower, a Tranche 1 Revolving Lender shall cancel all forms of BAs which have been pre-signed or pre-endorsed by or on behalf of such Borrower and which are held by such Tranche 1 Revolving Lender and have not yet been issued in accordance herewith.  Each Tranche 1 Revolving Lender shall maintain a record with respect to BAs held by it in blank hereunder, voided by it for any reason, accepted and purchased by it hereunder, and cancelled at their respective maturities.  Each Tranche 1 Revolving Lender agrees to provide such records to a Borrower at such Borrower s expense upon request.  
   (f)  Execution  .  Drafts drawn by a Borrower to be accepted as Bankers  Acceptances shall be signed by a duly authorized officer or officers of such Borrower or by its attorneys including attorneys   

39 
  appointed pursuant to Section   2.3(e)   above.  Notwithstanding that any Person whose signature appears on any Bankers  Acceptance may no longer be an authorized signatory for such Borrower at the time of issuance of a Bankers  Acceptance, that signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes as if the authority had remained in force at the time of issuance and any Bankers  Acceptance so signed shall be binding on such Borrower.  
 (g)  Issuance  .  The Administrative Agent, promptly following receipt of a notice of borrowing, continuation or conversion by way of Bankers  Acceptances, shall advise the applicable Tranche 1 Revolving Lenders of the notice and shall advise each such Tranche 1 Revolving Lender of the face amount of Bankers  Acceptances to be accepted by it and the applicable Contract Period (which shall be identical for all Revolving Lenders).  The aggregate face amount of Bankers  Acceptances to be accepted by a Tranche 1 Revolving Lender shall be determined by the Administrative Agent by reference to such Tranche 1 Revolving Lender s Revolving Percentage of the issue of Bankers  Acceptances, except that, if the face amount of a Bankers  Acceptance which would otherwise be accepted by a Tranche 1 Revolving Lender would not be C$100,000, or a whole multiple thereof, the face amount shall be increased or reduced by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion to C$100,000, or the nearest whole multiple of that amount, as appropriate;   provided   that after such issuance, no Tranche 1 Revolving Lender shall have outstanding Revolving Extensions of Credit in excess of its Tranche 1 Revolving Commitment.  
 (h)  Waiver of Presentment and Other Conditions  .  Each Borrower waives presentment for payment and any other defense to payment of any amounts due to a Revolving Lender in respect of a Bankers  Acceptance accepted and purchased by it pursuant to this Agreement which might exist solely by reason of the Bankers  Acceptance being held, at the maturity thereof, by such Revolving Lender in its own right and each Borrower agrees not to claim any days of grace if such Revolving Lender as holder sues such Borrower on the Bankers  Acceptance for payment of the amount payable by such Borrower thereunder.  On the specified maturity date of a BA, or the date of any prepayment thereof in accordance with this Agreement, if earlier, the applicable Borrower shall pay to such Revolving Lender that has accepted such BA the full face amount of such BA (or shall make provision for payment by way of conversion or continuation in accordance with Sections 2.11(c) or (d)) in full and absolute satisfaction of its obligations with respect to such BA, and after such payment, such Borrower shall have no further liability in respect of such BA (except to the extent that any such payment is rescinded or reclaimed by operation of law or otherwise) and such Revolving Lender shall be entitled to all benefits of, and will make and otherwise be responsible for all payments due to the redeeming holder or any third parties under, such BA.   
 (i)  BA Equivalent Loans by Non-BA Lenders  .  Whenever a Borrower requests a borrowing by way of Bankers  Acceptances, each Non-BA Lender shall, in lieu of accepting a Bankers  Acceptance, make a BA Equivalent Loan in an amount equal to such Non BA Lender s Revolving Percentage of such borrowing.  On the relevant Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall credit an account as directed by such Borrower with the aggregate of the amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lenders and in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent.  

40 
    (j)   Terms Applicable to BA Equivalent Loans  .  As set out in the definition of  Bankers  Acceptances , that term includes Discount Notes and all terms of this Agreement applicable to Bankers  Acceptances (including the provisions of Section   2.3(e)   relating to their execution by the Revolving Lenders under power of attorney) shall apply equally to Discount Notes evidencing BA Equivalent Loans with such changes as may in the context be necessary.  For greater certainty:  
 (i)  the term of a Discount Note shall be the same as the Contract Period for Bankers  Acceptances accepted and purchased on the same Borrowing Date in respect of the same borrowing;  
 (ii)  an acceptance fee will be payable in respect of a Discount Note and shall be calculated at the same rate and in the same manner as the Acceptance Fee in respect of a Bankers  Acceptance; and  
 (iii)  the Discount Rate applicable to a Discount Note shall be the Discount Rate applicable to Bankers  Acceptances accepted by a Revolving Lender that is not a Schedule I Lender in accordance with the definition of  Discount Rate  on the same Borrowing Date or date of continuation or conversion, as the case may be, in respect of the same borrowing for the relevant Contract Period.  
 Each Non-BA Lender may agree, in lieu of receiving any Discount Notes, that such Discount Notes may be uncertificated and the applicable BA Equivalent Loan shall be evidenced by a loan account, which such Non-BA Lender shall maintain in its name, and in such event such loan account shall be entitled to all the benefits of Discount Notes in respect of BA Equivalent Loans. 
 (k)  Depository Bills and Notes Act  .  At the option of the applicable Borrower and any Revolving Lender, Bankers  Acceptances under this Agreement to be accepted by such Revolving Lender may be issued in the form of depository bills for deposit with The Canadian Depository for Securities Limited pursuant to the   Depository Bills and Notes Act   (Canada).  All depository bills so issued shall be governed by the provisions of this Section 2.3.   
       2.4   Circumstances Making Bankers  Acceptances Unavailable . 
   (a)  If the Administrative Agent determines in good faith, which determination shall constitute   prima facie   evidence thereof, and notifies the Parent Borrower that, by reason of circumstances affecting the money market, there is no market for Bankers  Acceptances, then:  
 (i)  the right of the Borrowers to request a borrowing by way of Bankers  Acceptance shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent determines that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist and the Administrative Agent so notifies the Parent Borrower; and  
 (ii)  any notice relating to a borrowing by way of Bankers  Acceptance which is outstanding at such time shall be deemed to be a notice requesting a borrowing by way of Canadian Prime Rate Loans (all as if it were a notice given pursuant to Section 2.2).   
 (b)  The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Parent Borrower and the Revolving Lenders of the suspension in accordance with Section 2.4(a) of the Borrowers  right to request a borrowing by way of Bankers  Acceptance and of the termination of such suspension.   

41 
                    2.5    Swingline Commitment  .  
       (a)  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, from time to time during the Revolving Commitment Period, each Swingline Lender severally agrees, in reliance on the agreements of the other Tranche 1 Revolving Lenders set forth in Section 2.6, to make a portion of the credit otherwise available to the Borrowers under the Tranche 1 Revolving Commitments by (i) making swing line loans (such loans,     US Swingline Loans    ) to the Non-Canadian Borrowers in US Dollars and (ii) making swing line loans (such loans,    Canadian Swingline Loans    and, together with the US Swingline Loans, the    Swingline Loans   ) to any Canadian Borrower in US Dollars or Canadian Dollars;   provided   that the Swingline Lenders shall not make any Swingline Loan available if, after giving effect thereto (i) the aggregate principal amount of such Swingline Lender s Swingline Loans outstanding would exceed the Swingline Commitment then in effect for such Swingline Lender, (ii) the aggregate principal amount of all Swingline Lenders  Swingline Loans outstanding would exceed the Swingline Commitments then in effect (iii) such Swingline Lender s Revolving Extensions of Credit (in its capacity as a Tranche 1 Revolving Lender) would exceed its Tranche 1 Revolving Commitment, (iv) such Swingline Lender s Revolving Extensions of Credit would exceed its Revolving Commitment or   (v) the aggregate amount of the Revolving Extensions of Credit of the Tranche 1 Revolving Lenders outstanding at such time would exceed the aggregate amount of Tranche 1 Revolving Commitments in effect at such time.  During the Revolving Commitment Period, the Borrowers may use the Swingline Commitment by borrowing, repaying and reborrowing, all in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof.  Each Swin  gline Loan shall be an ABR Loan, in the case of a US Swingline Loan, a US Base Rate Loan, in the case of a Canadian Swingline Loan denominated in US Dollars, or a Canadian Prime Rate Loan, in the case of a Canadian Swingline Loan denominated in Canadian Dollars.  
 (b)  Each Borrower shall repay its outstanding Swingline Loans on such terms as it may agree with the relevant Swingline Lenders;   provided   that in no event shall such repayment occur later than the earliest of (x) the date that is ten Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made, (y) the Termination Date and (z) the date on which a Change of Control shall occur.  
 (c)  Independent Swingline Lender Obligations  .  The failure of any Swingline Lender to make its ratable portion of a Swingline Loan shall not relieve any other Swingline Lender of its obligation hereunder to make its ratable portion of such Swingline Loan on the date of such Swingline Loan, but no Swingline Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Swingline Lender to make the ratable portion of a Swingline Loan to be made by such other Swingline Lender on the date of any Swingline Loan.    
               2.6   Procedures for Swingline Borrowing and Reporting; Refunding of Swingline Loans .

Whenever any Canadian Borrower desires that the Swingline Lenders make Canadian Swingline Loans, it shall give the Swingline Lenders and the Administrative Agent irrevocable notice (which notice must be received by each Swingline Lender not later than 12:00 P.M. on the proposed Borrowing Date), specifying (A) whether such Loan shall be denominated in US Dollars or Canadian Dollars, (B) the amount to be borrowed and (C) the requested Borrowing Date (which shall be a Business Day during the Revolving Commitment Period).

 (ii) Alternatively, the Parent Borrower or any Canadian Borrower may establish or designate, by agreement with each relevant Swingline Lender, at its Lending Office, accounts for any Canadian Borrower (one in Canadian Dollars and one in US Dollars) or the Parent Borrower (in US Dollars), each of which is referred to as a    Swingline Account  .  The Swingline Accounts shall record the day to day banking business of the applicable Canadian Borrower or the Parent Borrower with such Swingline Lender (other than under this Agreement).  If, at the end of any Business Day, the balance in any Swingline Account is a debit, then to the extent there is sufficient availability under the Swingline Commitment and subject to the conditions in Section 2.5(a), such debit position shall be deemed to be recorded as a Swingline Loan by way of (i) ABR Loan, in the case of a debit position for the Parent Borrower denominated in US Dollars, (ii) US Base Rate Loan, in the case of a debit position for a Canadian Borrower denominated in US Dollars or (iii) Canadian Prime Rate Loan, in the case of a debit position for a Canadian Borrower denominated in Canadian Dollars.  The accounts and records of each Swingline Lender shall constitute, in the absence of manifest error,   prima facie   evidence of outstanding Swingline Loans and Swingline Account balances from time to time, the Borrowing Dates such Swingline Loans were made and all amounts that the applicable Canadian Borrower or Parent Borrower has paid from time to time on account of such Obligations. 
 (iii)  Each Swingline Lender and the relevant Borrower shall be solely responsible for monitoring the outstanding balance of all Swingline Accounts and Swingline Loans made by such Swingline Lender from time to time.

     (b)  A Borrower may, from time to time voluntarily prepay Swingline Loans on such terms as it may agree with the relevant Swingline Lender.  At any time when a Swingline Loan is outstanding, at the written request of a Swingline Lender to the Administrative Agent, with a copy to the relevant Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall, on the date of such request, request (on behalf of such Borrower, which hereby irrevocably directs the Administrative Agent to act on its behalf) each Tranche 1 Revolving Lender to make a Tranche 1 Revolving Loan by way of an ABR Loan (in the case of US Swingline Loans), a US Base Rate Loan (in the case of Canadian Swingline Loans denominated in US Dollars) or a Canadian Prime Rate Loan (in the case of Canadian Swingline Loans denominated in Canadian Dollars), to such Borrower in an amount equal to such Tranche 1 Revolving Lender s Tranche 1 Revolving Percentage of the principal amount of such outstanding Swingline Loan (the    Refunded Swingline Loan   ) owing by such Borrower on the date such notice is given (regardless of whether such Refunded Swingline Loan complies with the minimum borrowing provisions of Section 2.2).  Upon such request by the Administrative Agent for the refunding of the Swingline Loan (which shall be given no

   (c)  If, before the making of an ABR Loan, a US Base Rate Loan or a Canadian Prime Rate Loan under Section 2.6(b), a Default or an Event of Default under Section 8(h) or 8(i) shall have occurred and be continuing, each Tranche 1 Revolving Lender will, on the date such ABR Loan, US Base Rate Loan or Canadian Prime Rate Loan was to have been made, purchase from the Swingline Lenders an undivided participating interest in the Swingline Loan to be refunded in an amount (the       Swingline Participation Amount    ) equal to its Tranche 1 Revolving Percentage of such Swingline Loan to be refunded, and each such Tranche 1 Revolving Lender will immediately transfer to the Administrative Agent, in funds for value, the amount of its participation.  
 (d)  Whenever, at any time after any Swingline Lender has received from any Tranche 1 Revolving Lender such Tranche 1 Revolving Lender s Swingline Participation Amount, such Swingline Lender receives any payment on account of the Swingline Loans, such Swingline Lender will distribute, through the Administrative Agent, to such Tranche 1 Revolving Lender its Tranche 1 Revolving Percentage of such amount (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Tranche 1 Revolving Lender s participating interest was outstanding and funded and, in the case of principal and interest payments, to reflect such Tranche 1 Revolving Lender s   pro     rata   portion of such payment if such payment is not sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on all Swingline Loans then due);   provided  ,   however  , that in the event that such payment received by such Swingline Lender is required to be returned, such Tranche 1 Revolving Lender will return to such Swingline Lender any portion thereof previously distributed to it by such Swingline Lender.  
 (e)  Each Tranche 1 Revolving Lender s obligation to make the Loans referred to in Section 2.6(b) and to purchase participating interests pursuant to Section 2.6(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such Tranche 1 Revolving Lender or the relevant Borrower may have against any Swingline Lender, such Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions specified in Section 5; (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Parent Borrower and its Subsidiaries; (iv) any breach of this Agreement by the Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any other Tranche 1 Revolving Lender; or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.

     (a)  The Parent Borrower agrees to pay, or caused to be paid, to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender a facility fee (a    Facility Fee   ) in US Dollars, which shall accrue at the Facility Fee Rate on the amount of the Revolving Commitments of such Lender, whether used or unused, during the period from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the Termination Date (or earlier date of termination of the Revolving Commitments in their entirety);   provided   that if any Loans remain outstanding after such Termination Date (or such earlier date of termination), such Facility Fee shall be payable on the aggregate principal thereof for the period after the Termination Date (or such earlier date of termination) until such Loans are paid in full.  Accrued Facility Fees shall be payable in arrears on the third Business Day after the last day of March, June, September and December of each year

       2.8   Termination or Reduction of Revolving Commitments .  The Parent Borrower (on behalf of itself and the other Borrowers) shall have the right, upon not less than three Business Days  notice to the Administrative Agent to terminate the Revolving Commitments or, from time to time, to reduce the amount of the Revolving Commitments;  provided  that no such termination or reduction of Revolving Commitments shall be permitted if, after giving effect thereto and to any prepayments of the Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans made on the effective date thereof, the Total Revolving Extensions of Credit would exceed the Total Revolving Commitments as so terminated or reduced.  Any such reduction shall be in a minimum amount equal to US$10,000,000 or a whole multiple of US$1,000,000 in excess thereof, and shall reduce permanently the Revolving Commitments then in effect.  Each reduction of the Revolving Commitments shall be made ratably among the Classes in accordance with the percentage which the aggregate amount of Revolving Commitments of each Class then constitutes of the Total Revolving Commitments then in effect and modified by the Administrative Agent to account for rounding adjustments.  Each reduction of the Revolving Commitments of any Class shall be made ratably among the Lenders within such Class in accordance with their respective Revolving Commitments of such Class. 
       2.9   Optional Prepayments .

Bankers  Acceptances may be prepaid prior to the maturity thereof,   provided   that the applicable Borrower shall pay the full face amount of such Bankers  Acceptances to the Administrative Agent, which payment shall be made in full and absolute satisfaction of such Borrower s reimbursement obligation in respect of such Bankers  Acceptances.  
         2.10   Mandatory Prepayments . 
     (a)  If, due to exchange rate fluctuations or for any reason whatsoever, the aggregate amount of the Revolving Extensions of Credit of the Tranche 1 Revolving Lenders outstanding shall, at   

45 
  any time, exceed 105% of the aggregate amount of the Tranche 1 Revolving Commitments in effect at such time, (the amount of such excess, an    Excess Amount   ), then within three Business Days of written notice from the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers shall   first  , prepay the Tranche 1 Revolving Loans and/or Swingline Loans in an amount so as to, as nearly as possible, eliminate such Excess Amount; and   second  , if any Excess Amount shall remain after such prepayment, provide cash collateral or such other security on Cash Equivalents as the Administrative Agent may require in US Dollars, Euros or Canadian Dollars in an amount equal to the remaining Excess Amount, which collateral shall secure all Obligations outstanding and shall remain in the Administrative Agent s possession until such Excess Amount is eliminated whereupon the collateral shall be released by the Administrative Agent to the Borrowers.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, including any provision contemplating a continuation or conversion, whenever an Excess Amount exists, (A) upon the last day of the Contract Period of any Bankers  Acceptance, the relevant Borrower shall repay the Bankers  Acceptance, or (B) upon the last day of the Interest Period in respect of a Eurodollar Loan or EURIBOR Loan that is a Revolving Loan, the relevant Borrower shall repay the Eurodollar Loan or EURIBOR Loan, as applicable, in each case to the extent necessary to cover the Excess Amount and any repayments under clauses (A) and (B) shall be applied in reduction of the Excess Amount.     
 (b)  Each prepayment of the Loans under Section 2.10 (except in the case of Revolving Loans that are ABR Loans, US Base Rate Loans or Canadian Prime Rate Loans and Swingline Loans) shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the amount prepaid.   
 (c)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.10 and subject to Section 3.5 with respect to Letters of Credit, if at any time any prepayment of the Loans pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 2.10 would result, after giving effect to the procedures set forth in this Agreement, in a Borrower being required to indemnify for breakage costs under Section 2.19 as a result of Eurodollar Loans or EURIBOR Loans being prepaid other than on the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto, then, such Borrower may, so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, in its sole discretion, initially deposit a portion (up to 100%) of the amounts that otherwise would have been paid in respect of such Eurodollar Loans or EURIBOR Loans with the Administrative Agent (which deposit must be equal in amount to the amount of such Eurodollar Loans or EURIBOR Loans not immediately prepaid) to be held as security for the obligations of such Borrower to make such prepayment pursuant to a cash collateral agreement to be entered into on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, with such cash collateral to be directly applied upon the first occurrence thereafter of the last day of an Interest Period with respect to such Eurodollar Loans or EURIBOR Loans (or such earlier date or dates as shall be requested by such Borrower);       provided    that such unpaid Eurodollar Loans or EURIBOR Loans shall continue to bear interest in accordance with Section 2.11 until such unpaid Eurodollar Loans or EURIBOR Loans or the related portion of such Eurodollar Loans or such EURIBOR Loans, as the case may be, have or has been prepaid.   
           2.11   Conversion and Continuation Options . 
   (a)  The Borrowers may elect from time to time to convert ABR Loans (other than Swingline Loans) or US Base Rate Loans (other than Swingline Loans) to Eurodollar Loans by giving the Administrative Agent prior irrevocable notice of such election (which notice shall specify the length of the initial Interest Period therefor);   provided   that no ABR Loan or US Base Rate Loan may be converted into a Eurodollar Loan when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit any such conversion (with notice of such determination to be delivered to the relevant Borrower as soon as practicable).  The Borrowers may elect from time to time to convert Eurodollar Loans to ABR Loans and the Canadian Borrowers may elect from time to time to convert Eurodollar Loans to US Base Rate Loans, in each case by giving the Administrative Agent irrevocable notice of such election as set forth in   

46 
  Section 2.11(f);   provided   that, in each case, any such conversion of Eurodollar Loans may only be made on the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto.  Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof.  
 (b)  Any Eurodollar Loan or EURIBOR Loan may be continued as such upon the expiration of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto by the relevant Borrower giving irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the term  Interest Period  set forth in Section 1.1, of the length of the next Interest Period to be applicable to such Loans,    provided    that no Eurodollar Loan or EURIBOR Loan may be continued as such when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent has or the Required Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit any such continuation (with notice of such determination to be delivered to the relevant Borrower as soon as practicable), and   provided  ,   further  , that (i) if the relevant Borrower shall fail to give any required notice as described above in this paragraph such Eurodollar Loans or EURIBOR Loans shall be automatically continued as such with an Interest Period of one month on the last day of such then expiring Interest Period, but only to the extent that such continuation may then be made in accordance with the applicable provisions of the term  Interest Period  set forth in Section 1.1, or (ii) if such continuation is not permitted pursuant to the preceding provisos such Eurodollar Loans shall be automatically converted to ABR Loans, in the case of Eurodollar Loans to the Non-Canadian Borrowers, or US Base Rate Loans, in the case of Eurodollar Loans to the Canadian Borrowers, and such EURIBOR Loans shall be automatically converted to Foreign Base Rate Loans, in each case on the last day of such then expiring Interest Period.  Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof.   
   (c)  Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Borrowers may elect from time to time to convert Canadian Prime Rate Loans (other than Swingline Loans) into Bankers  Acceptances or Bankers  Acceptances into Canadian Prime Rate Loans upon giving to the Administrative Agent prior irrevocable notice,   provided   that:  
 (i)  no Canadian Prime Rate Loan may be converted into a Bankers  Acceptance when any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent has or the Required Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit any such conversion;  
 (ii)  each conversion to Bankers  Acceptances or to Canadian Prime Rate Loans shall be for a minimum aggregate amount and whole multiples in excess thereof as are specified in Section 2.3;   
 (iii)  Bankers  Acceptances may be converted only on the maturity date of such Bankers  Acceptances; and  
 (iv)  if less than all Bankers  Acceptances are converted, after such conversion not less than C$10,000,000 shall remain as Bankers  Acceptances.  
     (d)  At or before 10:00 A.M. two Business Days before the maturity date of any Bankers  Acceptances, the relevant Borrower shall give to the Administrative Agent prior irrevocable notice which notice shall specify either that such Borrower intends to repay the maturing Bankers  Acceptances on the maturity date or that such Borrower intends to continue to issue Bankers  Acceptances on the maturity date to provide for the payment of the maturing Bankers  Acceptances.  Subject to Section 2.3(a), if the relevant Borrower fails to provide such notice to the Administrative Agent, such Borrower shall be deemed to have notified the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders of its intention to continue to issue Bankers  Acceptances with a Contract Period of one month to provide for the payment of the   

47 
  maturing Bankers  Acceptances.  If (i) pursuant to any other provision of this Agreement, Bankers  Acceptances may not be issued as contemplated in the preceding sentence to provide for the payment of maturing Bankers  Acceptances, (ii) the relevant Borrower fails to repay the maturing Bankers  Acceptances, or (iii) a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on such maturity date and the Administrative Agent has or the Required Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit any issuance of new Bankers  Acceptances to provide for the payment of maturing Bankers  Acceptances, then such Borrower s obligations in respect of the maturing Bankers  Acceptances shall be deemed to have been converted on the maturity date thereof into a Canadian Prime Rate Loan in an amount equal to the face amount of the maturing Bankers  Acceptances.  
 (e)  Without limitation of this Section, no Loans denominated in US$ may be converted into Loans denominated in C$ or Euros, no Loans denominated in C$ may be converted into Loans denominated in US$ or Euros and no Loans denominated in Euros may be converted into Loans denominated in US$ or C$.  For the avoidance of doubt, Revolving Loans to the Borrowers denominated in US$, C$ or Euros must be repaid in such currency, but may be reborrowed in either US$, C$ or Euros.  
 (f)  To make an election pursuant to this Section, the relevant Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election, in each case within the notice period and in the form that would be required under Section 2.2, as the case may be, if such Borrower were requesting a borrowing of Loans of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election.   
 (g)  For the avoidance of doubt, the conversion or continuation of Loans as herein provided shall not be deemed to constitute a repayment of existing Loans hereunder or the making of new Loans hereunder.  
       2.12   Limitations on Interest Periods and Contract Periods .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all borrowings, conversions and continuations of Eurodollar Loans and EURIBOR Loans and all selections of Interest Periods shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that no more than an aggregate amount of ten different Contract Periods in respect of BA issuances and Interest Periods in respect of Eurodollar Loans or EURIBOR Loans shall be outstanding at any one time to the Borrowers. 
         2.13   Interest Rates and Payment Dates . 
 (a)  Each Eurodollar Loan shall bear interest for each day during each Interest Period with respect thereto at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate determined for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin.  
   (b)  Each EURIBOR Loan shall bear interest for each day during each Interest Period with respect thereto at a rate per annum equal to the EURIBOR Rate determined for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin.  
 (c)  Each US Base Rate Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the US Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin.  
   (d)  Each ABR Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the ABR plus the Applicable Margin.  
   (e)  Each Canadian Prime Rate Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Canadian Prime Rate plus the Applicable Margin.  

48 
    (f)   Upon acceptance of a Bankers  Acceptance by a Revolving Lender, the relevant Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent on behalf of such Revolving Lender a fee (the    Acceptance Fee   ) calculated on the face amount of the Bankers  Acceptance at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin on the basis of the number of days in the Contract Period for such Bankers  Acceptance.  Any adjustment to the Acceptance Fee (including any adjustment as necessary to reflect the operation of paragraph (f) of this Section) shall be computed based on the number of days remaining in the Contract Period of such Bankers  Acceptances from and including the effective date of any change in the Applicable Margin.  Any increase in such Acceptance Fee shall be paid by the relevant Borrower to the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Revolving Lenders on the last day of the Contract Period of the relevant Bankers  Acceptance.  Any decrease in such Acceptance Fee shall be paid by each Revolving Lender to the relevant Borrower, through the Administrative Agent, on the last day of the Contract Period of the relevant Bankers  Acceptance.  
   (g)  (i) If all or a portion of the principal amount of any Loan or Reimbursement Obligation shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (A) in the case of any Eurodollar Loans, or EURIBOR Loans, the rate that would otherwise be applicable thereto pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section   plus   2%, (B) in the case of ABR Loans and Reimbursement Obligations of Non-Canadian Borrowers denominated in US Dollars, the rate applicable to ABR Loans   plus   2%, (C) in the case of any US Base Rate Loans and Reimbursement Obligations of any Canadian Borrower denominated in US Dollars, the rate applicable to US Base Rate Loans   plus   2%, (D) in the case of Canadian Prime Rate Loans, any Bankers  Acceptances and Reimbursement Obligations denominated in Canadian Dollars, the rate applicable to Canadian Prime Rate Loans   plus   2%, or (E) in the case of Reimbursement Obligations denominated in Euros, the rate applicable to Foreign Base Rate Loans   plus   2%; and (ii) if all or a portion of any interest payable on any Loan or Reimbursement Obligation or any Facility Fee or other amount payable hereunder shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate then applicable to ABR Loans if such amount is denominated in US Dollars and owed by any Non-Canadian Borrower, Canadian Prime Rate Loans if such amount is denominated in Canadian Dollars, US Base Rate Loans if such amount is denominated in US Dollars and owed by any Canadian Borrower or Foreign Base Rate Loans if such amount is denominated in Euros, in each case,   plus   2% (or, in the case of any such other amounts, the rate then applicable to ABR Loans (if such amount is owed in US Dollars by a Non-Canadian Borrower), US Base Rate Loans (if such amount is owed in US Dollars by any Canadian Borrower), Canadian Prime Rate Loans (if such amount is owed in Canadian Dollars) or Foreign Base Rate Loans (if such amount is owed in Euros), in each case,   plus   2%), in each case, with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) above, from the date of such non payment until such amount is paid in full (as well after as before judgment).  
 (h)  Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date (except with respect to Acceptance Fees upon acceptance of Bankers  Acceptances, as to which paragraph (f) of this Section shall apply until the end of the respective Contract Periods therefor),   provided   that interest accruing pursuant to paragraph (g) of this Section shall be payable from time to time on demand.  Interest in respect of Loans and Reimbursement Obligations that are denominated in US Dollars (and all other amounts denominated in US Dollars) shall be payable in US Dollars, interest in respect of Loans and Reimbursement Obligations that are denominated in Euros (and all other amounts denominated in Euros) shall be payable in Euros and interest in respect of Loans or Reimbursement Obligations that are denominated in Canadian Dollars (and all other amounts denominated in Canadian Dollars) shall be payable in Canadian Dollars.  
   (i)  (i) If any provision of this Agreement would obligate any Borrower to make any payment of interest or other amount payable to any Revolving Lender in an amount or calculated at a rate   

49 
  which would be prohibited by law or would result in a receipt by such Lender of interest at a criminal rate (as such terms are construed under the   Criminal Code   (Canada)), then notwithstanding such provision, such amount or rate shall be deemed to have been adjusted with retroactive effect to the maximum amount or rate of interest, as the case may be, as would not be so prohibited by law or so result in a receipt by such Revolving Lender of interest at a criminal rate, such adjustment to be effected, to the extent necessary, as follows:  
 (x) first, by reducing the amount or rates of interest required to be paid under this Section; and 
 (y) thereafter, by reducing any fees, commissions, premiums and other amounts which would constitute interest for purposes of Section 347 of the  Criminal Code  (Canada). 
 (ii)  If, notwithstanding the provisions of clause (i) of this paragraph (i), and after giving effect to all adjustments contemplated thereby, any Revolving Lender shall have received an amount in excess of the maximum permitted by such clause, then the relevant Borrower shall be entitled, by notice in writing to such Revolving Lender, to obtain reimbursement from such Revolving Lender of an amount equal to such excess, and, pending such reimbursement, such amount shall be deemed to be an amount payable by such Revolving Lender to such Borrower.  
 (iii)  Any amount or rate of interest referred to in this paragraph (i) shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices and principles as an effective annual rate of interest over the term of any Loan on the assumption that any charges, fees or expenses that fall within the meaning of  interest  (as defined in the   Criminal Code   (Canada)) shall, if they relate to a specific period of time, be prorated over that period of time and otherwise be prorated over the period from the Closing Date to the Termination Date and, in the event of dispute, a certificate of a Fellow of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries appointed by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive for the purposes of such determination absent manifest error.  
       2.14   Computation of Interest and Fees . 
 (a)  (i) Interest on Loans the interest of which is not calculated on the basis of the Prime Rate or the reference rate of the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed, (ii) Facility Fees and fees payable pursuant to Section 3.3 and interest on ABR Loans, US Base Rate Loans and Canadian Prime Rate Loans the interest of which is calculated based on the Prime Rate or such reference rate shall be calculated on the basis of a 365- (or 366; in the case of a leap year) day year for the actual days elapsed and (iii) Acceptance Fees and interest calculated on the basis of the CDOR Rate shall be calculated on the basis of a 365- (or 366; in the case of a leap year) day year for the actual days elapsed.  All interest on Loans shall be calculated on a daily basis on the principal amount thereof remaining unpaid.  The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the relevant Borrower and the relevant Lenders of each determination of a Eurodollar Rate, EURIBOR Rate or the Discount Rate.  Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the ABR, the US Base Rate, or the Canadian Prime Rate shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change becomes effective.  The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the relevant Borrower and the relevant Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each such change in interest rate.   
   (b)  Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall, in the absence of manifest error, constitute   prima facie   evidence of the   

50 
  same.  The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of a Borrower, deliver to such Borrower a statement showing the quotations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate applicable to it pursuant hereto.  
 (c)  For the purposes of the   Interest Act   (Canada), in any case in which an interest rate is stated in this Agreement to be calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days or any other period of time that is less than a calendar year, the yearly rate of interest to which the rate determined pursuant to such calculation is equivalent is the rate so determined multiplied by the actual number of days in the calendar year for which the calculation is made and divided by either 360 or such other period of time, as the case may be.  In addition, the principle of deemed investment of interest does not apply to any interest calculations under this Agreement and the rates of interest stipulated in this Agreement are intended to be nominal rates and not effective rates or yields.  
       2.15   Inability to Determine Interest Rate .  If prior to the first day of any Interest Period: 
 (a)  the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall, in the absence of manifest error, constitute   prima facie   evidence thereof) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate or the EURIBOR Rate for such Interest Period, or  
 (b)  the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Required Lenders, each acting reasonably and in good faith, that the Eurodollar Rate or the EURIBOR Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (as certified by such Lenders, such certification constituting, in the absence of manifest error,   prima facie   evidence thereof) of making or maintaining their affected Loans during such Interest Period,  
 the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to the relevant Borrower and the relevant Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter.  If such notice is given (x) (i) any Eurodollar Loans requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as ABR Loans (in the case of any such Loans to be made to a Non-Canadian Borrower) or US Base Rate Loans (in the case of any such Loans to be made to any Canadian Borrower) and (ii) any EURIBOR Loans requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as Foreign Base Rate Loans, (y) (i) any Loans that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to Eurodollar Loans shall be continued as ABR Loans (in the case of any such loans to be made to a Non-Canadian Borrower) or US Base Rate Loans (in the case of any such loans to be made to any Canadian Borrower) and (ii) any Loans that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to EURIBOR Loans shall be continued as Foreign Base Rate Loans and (z) (i) any outstanding Eurodollar Loans shall be converted, on the last day of the then-current Interest Period, to ABR Loans (in the case of any such loans to be made to a Non-Canadian Borrower) or US Base Rate Loans (in the case of any such loans to be made to any Canadian Borrower) and (ii) any outstanding EURIBOR Loans shall be converted, on the last day of the then-current Interest Period, to Foreign Base Rate Loans.  Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further Eurodollar Loans or EURIBOR Loans shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the relevant Borrower have the right to convert Loans to Eurodollar Loans or EURIBOR Loans. 
         2.16   Pro Rata Treatment and Payments . 
   (a)  Each borrowing by a Borrower from the Tranche 1 Revolving Lenders hereunder, each payment by a Borrower on account of any Facility Fee and any Acceptance Fee payable in respect of the Tranche 1 Revolving Commitments and any reduction of the Tranche 1 Revolving Commitments   

51 
  shall be made   pro rata   according to the Tranche 1 Revolving Percentages of the Tranche 1 Revolving Lenders.  Each borrowing by a Borrower from the Tranche 2 Revolving Lenders hereunder, each payment by a Borrower on account of any Facility Fee payable in respect of the Tranche 2 Revolving Commitments and any reduction of the Tranche 2 Revolving Commitments shall be made   pro rata   according to the Tranche 2 Revolving Percentages of the Tranche 2 Revolving Lenders.  
 (b)  Each payment (including each prepayment) by a Borrower on account of principal of and interest on the US Revolving Loans, Canadian Revolving Loans or Euro Revolving Loans, as the case may be, shall be made to the relevant Revolving Lenders on a   pro rata   basis according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the relevant Revolving Loans then held by the applicable Revolving Lenders.  
 (c)  All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrowers hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 2:00 P.M., on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the relevant Lenders, at the relevant Funding Office, in US Dollars (with respect to Obligations denominated in US Dollars), Euros (with respect to Obligations denominated in Euros) or Canadian Dollars (with respect to Obligations denominated in Canadian Dollars), as the case may be, and in immediately available funds;   provided  , that if any event referred to in Section 8(h) or 8(i) shall occur or an acceleration of the maturity of the Loans pursuant to Section 8 shall occur, all Obligations denominated in Euros or Canadian Dollars shall be converted to US Dollars based on the then US Dollar Equivalent thereof (except for then undrawn and unexpired amounts of the outstanding Letters of Credit and except that any Bankers  Acceptance shall only be converted to US Dollars at the end of the Contract Period therefor).  Receipt by the Administrative Agent from a Borrower of funds pursuant to this Agreement, as principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be deemed to be receipt of such funds by the relevant Lenders.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the relevant Lenders promptly upon receipt in like funds as received.  If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the Eurodollar Loans or the EURIBOR Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day.  If any payment on a Eurodollar Loan or a EURIBOR Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.  In the case of any extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension.   
   (d)  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the relevant Borrower a corresponding amount.  If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon (i) in the case of any such amount in US Dollars, at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (x) the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate and (y) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available or (ii) in the case of any such amount in Euros or Canadian Dollars, at a rate per annum determined by the Administrative Agent (such determination to be conclusive and binding on such Lender) in accordance with the Administrative Agent s cost of funding the amount of such payment, for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent.  A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to   

52 
  any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  If such Lender s share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days after such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans, US Base Rate Loans or Canadian Prime Rate Loans, as the case may be, on demand, from the relevant Borrower.  Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligations to fulfill its Revolving Commitments in accordance with the provisions hereof or to prejudice any rights which a Borrower has against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.  
 (e)  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by a Borrower prior to the date of any payment due to be made by such Borrower hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower is making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the relevant Lenders their respective   pro rata   shares of a corresponding amount.  If such payment is not made to relevant Administrative Agent by the relevant Borrower within three Business Days after such due date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any amount which was made available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon (i) in the case of any such amount in US Dollars, at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (x) the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate and (y) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of any such amount in Euros or Canadian Dollars, at a rate per annum determined by the Administrative Agent (such determination to be conclusive and binding on such Lender) in accordance with the Administrative Agent s cost of funding the amount of such payment.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against a Borrower.  
                 2.17   Requirements of Law . 
 (a)  If the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority, in each case made or given subsequent to the date hereof:  
 (i)  shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender in connection with this Agreement that is not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate, the EURIBOR Rate, the Discount Rate or any other rate of interest hereunder;   
 (ii)  shall subject the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (ii) through (vi) of the definition of Excluded Taxes or (C) Taxes imposed on net income) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves or other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or   
 (iii)  shall impose on such Lender any other condition (other than a Tax of any kind) in respect of any credit made available by such Lender hereunder or any other condition (other than a Tax of any kind) with respect to this Agreement;

    and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender (or, in the case of (ii), the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or such Lender), by an amount that such Lender (or, in the case of (ii), the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Lender) reasonably deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Eurodollar Loans or EURIBOR Loans (or, in the case of (ii), any Loan) or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or purchasing or accepting Bankers  Acceptances, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, (A) such Lender (or, in the case of (ii), the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Lender) shall provide to the relevant Borrower a photocopy of the applicable law, rule, guideline, regulation, treaty or official directive and a written notice of such Lender (or, in the case of (ii), the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Lender) setting forth any additional amounts such Lender is entitled to claim (the    Additional Compensation   ) and the basis of calculation therefor, which shall, in the absence of manifest error, constitute   prima facie   evidence of such Additional Compensation, and (B) such Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender (or, in the case of (ii), the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Lender), within 30 Business Days of the receipt from such Lender (or, in the case of (ii), the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Lender) of the written notice herein referred to, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender (or, in the case of (ii), the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Lender) for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable.  
 (b)  If any Lender shall have reasonably determined that the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or liquidity requirements or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy or liquidity requirements (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority, in each case made subsequent to the date hereof or, if later, the date such Lender became a Lender, shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder or under or in respect of any Letter of Credit to a level below that which such Lender would have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender s policies with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, within 30 Business Days after submission by such Lender to the relevant Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor, accompanied by a photocopy or an excerpt of the applicable direction, requirement or guidelines and a written notice of such Lender setting forth the reduction rate of return and the basis of calculation of any compensating amount, such Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction.  
 (c)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) all requests, rules, guidelines, requirements and directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or by United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, and (ii) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines, requirements and directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith or in implementation thereof, shall in each case be deemed to be a change in law, regardless of the date enacted, adopted, issued or implemented.  
 (d)  A written notice as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by any Lender to the relevant Borrower (with a copy to relevant Administrative Agent) shall, in the absence of manifest error, constitute   prima facie   evidence of such additional amount.  The obligations of each Borrower pursuant to this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement or any other Loan Document and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.  

54 
                            2.18    Taxes  .  
   (a)  All payments made by or on account of any Loan Party to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender on account of any obligation under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any Taxes except to the extent such deduction or withholding is required by law.  If the applicable withholding agent is required to deduct or withhold any Tax from any such payments then, (i) in the case of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the amounts so payable by such Loan Party to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary such that the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Lender shall receive (after deduction or withholding of all Indemnified Taxes, including any Indemnified Taxes payable as a result of additional amounts paid by the relevant Loan Party pursuant to this Section 2.18) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in the relevant Loan Document had no such deduction or withholding been made, and (ii) the applicable withholding agent shall deduct or withhold such Taxes and shall remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with any Requirement of Law.   
 (b)  Whenever any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes are payable by any Loan Party pursuant to Section 2.18(a) or (c), as promptly as practical thereafter such Loan Party shall send to the Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of the relevant Issuing Lender or Lender, as the case may be, a copy of an original official receipt received by such Loan Party showing payment thereof.   
   (c)  The applicable Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.  
   (d)  The Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender and each Lender for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes that (i) the Loan Parties failed to pay as and when required pursuant to Section 2.18(a) or (c) or (ii) in the case of such Taxes other than United States, Spanish, Swedish and Canadian Taxes, are paid by the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Lender (including, in each case, in respect of amounts paid or payable under this Section 2.18(d) in respect of such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes) and, in each case, any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  The indemnity under this Section 2.18(d) shall be paid within 30 days after the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Lender delivers to the applicable Loan Party a certificate stating the amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes so paid or payable by such Person and describing the basis for the indemnification claim.  Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error.  Such Issuing Lender or Lender shall also deliver a copy of such certificate to the Administrative Agent.   
   (e)  Each Lender and each Issuing Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 30 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes attributable to such Lender or such Issuing Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender s or such Issuing Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.6(b) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender or such Issuing Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender or Issuing Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender and each Issuing Lender hereby authorizes   

55 
  the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender or Issuing Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender or Issuing Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (e).  
   (f)  (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document by any Borrower shall deliver to the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Parent Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Parent Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments by such Borrower to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Parent Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law, published administrative statements of the relevant Governmental Authority or reasonably requested by the Parent Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Parent Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in paragraphs (ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender s judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.  
 (ii)  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the applicable Borrower is a US Person:  
 (A)   the Administrative Agent and any Lender that is a US Person shall deliver to the Parent Borrower and, as the case may be, the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a party to any Loan Document (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Parent Borrower or, as the case may be, the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 (or applicable successor form) certifying that such Lender is exempt from US federal backup withholding tax;  
 (B)   any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a party to any Loan Document (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Parent Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:  
 (1)   in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or, in either case, an applicable successor form) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, US federal withholding Tax pursuant to the  interest  article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or, in either case, an applicable successor form) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, US federal withholding Tax pursuant to the  business profits  or  other income  article of such tax treaty;  

56 
    (2)    executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI or W-8EXP (or applicable successor form);  
   (3)   in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G (a    US Tax Compliance Certificate   ) to the effect that (A) such Foreign Lender is not a  bank  within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a  10 percent shareholder  of the applicable Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a  controlled foreign corporation  described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (B) the interest payments in question are not effectively connected with a US trade or business conducted by such Foreign Lender and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or, in either case, an applicable successor form); or  
 (4)   to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner of the applicable Loan (for example, where the Foreign Lender is a partnership or participating Lender granting a typical participation), executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY (or applicable successor form), accompanied by a Form W-8ECI, W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, US Tax Compliance Certificate, Form W-9 (or other successor forms), and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable;   provided   that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership (and not a participating Lender) and one or more beneficial owners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a US Tax Compliance Certificate on behalf of each such beneficial owner;  
 (C)   any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a party to any Loan Document (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Parent Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in US federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Parent Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and  
   (D)   if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to US federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Parent Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Parent Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and   

57 
  withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (D),  FATCA  shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.  
 (iii)  Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.  
 (iv)  For purposes of this Section 2.18(f), the term  Lender  shall include any Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent.     
 (g)  If a Loan Party makes a payment of any additional amounts to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender under Section 2.17 or 2.18 and the Administrative Agent or any such Issuing Lender or Lender shall become aware that it is entitled to receive a refund or to be granted a credit or relief or remission for or in respect of the amounts so paid by such Loan Party, it shall promptly notify such Loan Party of the availability of such refund, credit, relief or remission and shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of a request by such Loan Party, apply for such refund, credit, relief or remission.  If the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender, as applicable, reasonably determines that it has received a refund or been granted a credit, relief or remission as a result of any additional amounts paid by any Loan Party pursuant to Section 2.17 or 2.18, and, in such recipient s opinion such refund amount is both reasonably identifiable and quantifiable by it, it shall pay to such Loan Party an amount equal to such refund, credit, relief or remission (but only to the extent of additional amounts paid under Section 2.17 or this Section 2.18 giving rise to such refund, credit, relief or remission and only to the extent that the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Lender or Lender, as the case may be, determines acting reasonably and in good faith that it may do so without prejudice to its right, as against the relevant Governmental Authority, to retain such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Lender, as applicable, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund, credit, relief or remission).  Such Loan Party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Lender, as applicable, shall repay to such Person the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Lender, as applicable, is required to repay such refund, credit, relief or remission to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender, as applicable, be required to pay any amount to any Loan Party pursuant to this paragraph (g) the payment of which would place the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Lender, as applicable, in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Person would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid.  This paragraph shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender, as applicable, to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to any Loan Party or any other Person.   
   (h)  Upon the request, and at the expense, of the applicable Loan Party, the Administrative Agent and each Lender or Issuing Lender to which such Loan Party is required to pay any additional amount pursuant to Section 2.17 or this 2.18, and any Participant in respect of whose participation such payment is required, shall afford such Loan Party the opportunity to participate, as may reasonably be requested by such Loan Party, with the Administrative Agent or such Lender, Issuing Lender or Participant in contesting the imposition of any cost or Tax giving rise to such payment;     provided    that (i) the Administrative Agent or such Lender, Issuing Lender or Participant shall not be required to afford such Loan Party the opportunity to so participate unless such Loan Party shall have paid such additional   

58 
  amounts pursuant to Section   2.17   or   2.18   and (ii) such Loan Party shall reimburse the Administrative Agent or such Lender, Issuing Lender or Participant for its reasonable legal and accountants  fees and disbursements incurred in contesting the imposition of such cost or Tax;     provided   ,   further  , that notwithstanding the foregoing neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender, Issuing Lender or Participant shall be required to afford a Loan Party the opportunity to participate in contesting the imposition of any Taxes, if in its sole discretion (exercised in good faith) it determines that to do so would have an adverse effect on it.  
 (i)  If a Lender or Issuing Lender changes its applicable Lending Office (other than pursuant to Section 2.22) and the effect of such change, as of the date of such change, would be to cause the Loan Parties to become obligated to pay any additional amount under Section 2.17 or this Section 2.18, the Loan Parties shall not be obligated to pay any such additional amount, except to the extent that additional amounts were payable pursuant to Section 2.17 or this Section 2.18 to such Lender or Issuing Lender immediately prior to the designation of a new applicable Lending Office.     
 (j)  The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement or any other Loan Document and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.  
 (k)  For purposes of determining withholding Taxes imposed under FATCA, from and after the date of this Agreement, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall treat (and the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to treat) this Agreement as not qualifying as a  grandfathered obligation  within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1471-2(b)(2)(i).  
           2.19   Indemnity .  Each Borrower agrees to indemnify each relevant Lender for, and to hold each Lender harmless from, any loss or expense that such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by such Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar Loans or EURIBOR Loans after such Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (b) default by such Borrower in making any prepayment of or conversion from Eurodollar Loans or EURIBOR Loans after such Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or (c) the making of a prepayment of Eurodollar Loans or EURIBOR Loans on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto.  Such indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of such Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin included therein, if any) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank eurodollar market.  A certificate as to any amounts payable pursuant to this Section (which certificate shall state the event by reason of which such amounts are payable) submitted to the relevant Borrower by any Lender shall, in the absence of manifest error, constitute  prima facie  evidence thereof.  This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 
         2.20   Additional or Increased Commitments . 
     (a)  The Parent Borrower may, at any time and from time to time after the Closing Date, by written notice to the Administrative Agent, elect to (i) request one or more term loans (each an    Incremental Term Loan    and, collectively, the    Incremental Term Loans   ) or (ii) request additional or increased Tranche 1 Revolving Commitments and/or Tranche 2 Revolving Commitments hereunder (each   

59 
  such additional or increased commitment, an    Incremental Revolving Commitment    and, together with the Incremental Term Loans, the    Incremental Facilities   ), in an aggregate amount not in excess of US$400,000,000.  Any such Incremental Facility shall be in a minimum amount equal to US$10,000,000, or a whole multiple of US$1,000,000 in excess thereof.  Each such notice shall specify the date (each, an    Increased Amount Date   ) on which the Parent Borrower proposes that Incremental Facility shall be effective, which shall be a date not less than ten Business Days after the date on which such notice is delivered to Administrative Agent;   provided  , that any Lender offered or approached to provide all or a portion of any Incremental Facility may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to provide the same.  Such Incremental Facility shall become effective as of such Increased Amount Date;   provided  , that (1) no Default or Event of Default shall exist on such Increased Amount Date before or after giving effect to such Incremental Facility and to the making of any loans pursuant thereto on such Increased Amount Date; (2) the representations and warranties other than the representation and warranty contained in Section 4.5 made by each Borrower herein shall be true and correct in all material respects, on and as of such Increased Amount Date, except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties shall have been true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date; (3) any Incremental Facility may be offered either on a ratable basis to the Lenders or on a non pro-rata basis to one or more Lenders and/or to other lenders or entities reasonably acceptable to each of the Administrative Agent and the Parent Borrower; (4) the terms applicable to the Incremental Revolving Commitments shall be the same as those applicable to the relevant existing Revolving Commitments; (5)   the terms of any Incremental Term Loan shall, taken as a whole, be substantially identical, or less favorable, to the lenders making such Incremental Term Loan than the terms applicable to Loans hereunder, except that (A) the maturity date of any Incremental Term Loan shall be no earlier than the Termination Date, (B) the interest rate margins and other economic terms, amortization schedule (not exceeding 1% per annum), prepayment terms, borrower and currency applicable to any Incremental Term Loan shall be determined by the Parent Borrower and the lenders thereunder and (C) the foregoing limitation upon the terms of any Incremental Term Loan shall not apply to covenants, amortization schedule or other provisions applicable only to periods after the Termination Date  ;   (6) any New Lender shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and the Parent Borrower, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; (7) any New Lender providing an Incremental Revolving Commitment shall be subject to approval of the Administrative Agent, the Parent Borrower, each relevant Issuing Lender and each relevant Swingline Lender, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; (8) such Incremental Facility shall be effected pursuant to one or more supplements to this Agreement executed and delivered by the Parent Borrower, the Administrative Agent and one or more New Lenders or existing Lenders; and (9) the Parent Borrower shall deliver or cause to be delivered any customary legal opinions or other documents reasonably requested by Administrative Agent in connection with any such transaction, including any supplements or amendments to the US Guarantee Agreement and/or the Foreign Guarantee Agreement providing for such Incremental Facility and the extensions of credit thereunder to be guaranteed thereby.  
   (b)  On any Increased Amount Date on which any Incremental Facility becomes effective, subject to the foregoing terms and conditions, each new lender with an additional loan or commitment under the Incremental Facility (each, a    New Lender   ) shall become a Lender hereunder with respect to such loan or commitment and each Lender with an Incremental Revolving Commitment shall have its Revolving Commitment adjusted accordingly.  
 (c)  Each supplement to this Agreement effected in accordance with Section 2.20(a) may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.20 (including to provide transition provisions to provide for any additional or increased Revolving Commitments to share ratably in the extensions of credit under the Revolving Commitments).   

60 
                    2.21    Defaulting Lenders  .    Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:  
   (a)  fees shall cease to accrue on the Revolving Commitments of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.7;   
 (b)  the Revolving Commitments and Revolving Extensions of Credit of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 10.1);    provided   , that this clause (b) shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of such Lender or each Lender affected thereby if such Defaulting Lender is an affected Lender;  
   (c)  with respect to any Tranche 1 Revolving Lender becoming a Defaulting Lender, if any Swingline Exposure or L/C Exposure exists at the time such Tranche 1 Revolving Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:  
   (i)  all or any part of the Swingline Exposure and L/C Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders having Tranche 1 Revolving Commitments in accordance with their respective Tranche 1 Revolving Percentages, but only to the extent the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders  Revolving Extensions of Credit under such Tranche 1 Revolving Commitments plus such Defaulting Lender s Swingline Exposure and L/C Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders  Tranche 1 Revolving Commitments;  
 (ii)  if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the relevant Borrowers shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent (x) first, prepay such Swingline Exposure and (y) second, cash collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing Lenders only the Borrower s obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender s L/C Exposure under such Tranche 1 Revolving Commitments (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in the last paragraph of Section 8 for so long as such L/C Exposure is outstanding;   
 (iii)  if a Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender s L/C Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 3.3(a) with respect to such Defaulting Lender s L/C Exposure during the period such L/C Exposure is cash collateralized;   
 (iv)  if the L/C Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders under the Tranche 1 Revolving Commitments is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.7(a) and Section 3.3(a) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders  Tranche 1 Revolving Percentages; and   
 (v)  if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender s L/C Exposure is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Lenders or any other Lender hereunder, all fees payable under Section 3.3(a) with respect to such Defaulting Lender s L/C Exposure shall be payable to the Issuing Lenders until and to the extent that such L/C Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized;   

61 
        (d)       so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Swingline Lender shall be required to fund any Swingline Loan under the relevant Revolving Commitments and no Issuing Lender shall be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit thereunder, unless it is reasonably satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lender s then outstanding L/C Exposure thereunder will be 100% covered by the relevant Revolving Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders   and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with Section   2.21(c)  , and participating interests in any newly made Swingline Loan or any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders under the relevant Revolving Commitments in a manner consistent with Section   2.21(c)   (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein); and   
 (e)  any amount payable to such Defaulting Lender hereunder (whether on account of principal, interest or otherwise) shall, in lieu of being distributed to such Defaulting Lender, be retained by the Administrative Agent in a segregated account and, subject to any applicable requirements of law, be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent in the following order of priority:   
 (i)  first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder;   
 (ii)  second, to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent;   
 (iii)  third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Parent Borrower, held in such account as cash collateral for future funding obligations of the Defaulting Lender in respect of any Loans under this Agreement;   
 (iv)  fourth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrowers as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrowers against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and   
 (v)  fifth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction,   provided   that, with respect to this clause (v), if such payment is (x) a prepayment of the principal amount of any Loans which such Defaulting Lender has funded and (y) made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 are satisfied, such payment shall be applied solely to prepay the Revolving Percentage of the outstanding principal amount of Loans of each non-Defaulting Lender prior to being applied to the prepayment of the Loans of such Defaulting Lender.   
 In the event that the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers, and, with respect to a Tranche 1 Revolving Lender that is a Defaulting Lender, the Swingline Lenders and the Issuing Lenders, each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposure and L/C Exposure of the relevant Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender s Tranche 1 Revolving Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the relevant Loans of the other Lenders (other than Swingline Loans) as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Tranche 1 Revolving Percentage or Tranche 2 Revolving Percentage, as the case may be. 
           2.22   Change of Lending Office .  Each Lender and Issuing Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event or condition giving rise (or that would upon the passage of time give rise) to the operation of Section 2.17 or 2.18 with respect to such Lender or Issuing Lender, it will promptly

  notify the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent and, if requested by the Borrowers, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to mitigate the effects of such condition or event, including by designating another lending office for any Loans affected by such event with the object of avoiding the consequences of such event;   provided  , that such efforts do not, in the sole judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its lending offices to suffer an unreimbursed cost or a legal or regulatory disadvantage, and   provided  ,   further  , that nothing in this Section shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the rights of any Lender pursuant to Section   2.17   or   2.18  .  
         2.23   Replacement of Lenders .  If any Lender (a) requests compensation under Section 2.17, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amounts to the Administrative Agent, or any Issuing Lender on account of any Lender or to any Lender under Section 2.18(a), or (b) provides an Exclusion Notice or becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the Parent Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.6,     provided   that the Borrowers shall be obligated to pay the registration and processing fee referred to therein), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);  provided  that (i) such assignment does not conflict with any Requirement of Law, (ii) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such assignment, (iii) prior to any such assignment, the Lender being replaced shall have taken no action under Section 2.22 resulting in the elimination of the continued need for payment of amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.17 or 2.18(a), (iv) the assignee shall purchase, at par, all Loans and other amounts owing to such replaced Lender on or prior to the date of assignment, (v) the Borrowers shall be jointly and severally liable to such replaced Lender under Section 2.19 if any Eurodollar Loan or EURIBOR Loan owing to such replaced Lender shall be purchased other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto, (vi) the assignee shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender and each Swingline Lender, (vii) the assigning Lender shall be obligated to make such replacement in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.6, (viii) until such time as such assignment shall be consummated, the Borrowers shall pay all additional amounts (if any) required pursuant to Section 2.17 or 2.18(a), as the case may be, and (ix) any such assignment shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights that the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced Lender. 
       2.24   Additional Borrowers; Borrower Termination .   
   (a)  Upon at least ten Business Days  notice to the Administrative Agent and the relevant Lenders, the Parent Borrower may designate any Qualified Subsidiary as an additional borrower (   Additional Borrower   ),   provided   that on or prior to the effective date of such designation, the Administrative Agent shall have received (i) an Assumption Agreement to this Agreement executed by such Qualified Subsidiary, (ii) (x) if such Qualified Subsidiary is a Domestic Subsidiary, an assumption agreement to the US Guarantee Agreement executed by such Qualified Subsidiary (unless such Qualified Subsidiary is already a party to the US Guarantee Agreement), (y) if such Qualified Subsidiary is a Foreign Subsidiary organized under the laws of an Initial Borrower Foreign Jurisdiction, an assumption agreement to the Foreign Guarantee Agreement executed by such Qualified Subsidiary (unless such Qualified Subsidiary is already a party to the Foreign Guarantee Agreement) and (z) if such Qualified Subsidiary is a Foreign Subsidiary that is not organized under the laws of an Initial Borrower Foreign Jurisdiction, an assumption agreement to the Foreign Guarantee Agreement executed by such Qualified Subsidiary (unless such Qualified Subsidiary is already a party to the Foreign Guarantee Agreement) and any Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of the Parent Borrower that is not an Insignificant Subsidiary, organized under the laws of the jurisdiction under which such Qualified Subsidiary is organized (unless such Wholly-Owned Subsidiary is already a party to the Foreign Guarantee Agreement), (iii) a certificate of   

63 
  such Qualified Subsidiary and, as applicable, each such New Jurisdiction Additional Borrower Subsidiary Guarantor, substantially in the form of Exhibit B, with appropriate insertions and attachments, (iv) a long form good standing certificate or equivalent thereof for such Qualified Subsidiary and, as applicable, each such New Jurisdiction Additional Borrower Subsidiary Guarantor, from its jurisdiction of organization or formation (to the extent relevant in such jurisdiction), (v) an opinion, addressed to the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders and dated the date of designation, from counsel to such Qualified Subsidiary and, as applicable, each such New Jurisdiction Additional Borrower Subsidiary Guarantor, which opinion shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and (vi) such other documentation and/or certificates as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request (including, without limitation, documentation as any Lender may reasonably request, through the Administrative Agent, that is required in order to comply with any applicable  know your customer  or AML Legislation).  Upon such delivery such Qualified Subsidiary shall for all purposes of this Agreement be an Additional Borrower and a party to this Agreement.  
 (b)  The Parent Borrower may terminate the status of any Initial Canadian Borrower, the Initial Spanish Borrower, the Initial Swedish Borrower or any Additional Borrower as a Borrower under this Agreement at such time as no Revolving Extensions of Credit shall be outstanding for the account of such Borrower and no interest, fees or any other amounts shall be due and unpaid by such Borrower, and such Borrower and the Parent Borrower shall have executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent a Borrower Termination Notice.  
       (c)  Notwithstanding anything to contrary herein, following delivery of any Assumption Agreement with respect to any Additional Borrower that is a Foreign Subsidiary that is not organized under the laws of an Initial Borrower Foreign Jurisdiction, any Lender may, if such Lender reasonably determines that a credit extension to such Additional Borrower could reasonably be expected to result in materially adverse tax, regulatory or legal consequences to such Lender or would be illegal or impracticable under any applicable law or regulation, provide written notice of such determination to the Administrative Agent and the Parent Borrower within 10 Business Days of such delivery (   Exclusion Notice   ) whereupon such Lender will not be required to make such credit extensions to such Additional Borrower.  In the event that a Borrower delivers a notice of a borrowing under Section 2.2, such Lender agrees to provide its ratable share of the requested Loan to the Parent Borrower or another Additional Borrower for which such Lender has not issued an Exclusion Notice, in each case as set forth in such notice provided by such Borrower in accordance with Section 2.2.  
       SECTION 3.   LETTERS OF CREDIT  
       3.1   L/C Commitment .  
     (a)  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Issuing Lender, in reliance on the agreements of the other Tranche 1 Revolving Lenders set forth in Section 3.4(a), agrees to issue letters of credit (    Letters of Credit    ) for the account of the relevant Borrower on any Business Day before the fifth Business Day prior to the Termination Date in such form as may be approved from time to time by the relevant Issuing Lender;   provided   that such Issuing Lender shall have no obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such issuance, (i) the L/C Obligations would exceed the L/C Commitment or (ii) the aggregate amount of the Revolving Extensions of Credit of the Tranche 1 Revolving Lenders outstanding at such time would exceed the aggregate amount of Tranche 1 Revolving Commitments in effect at such time.  Each Letter of Credit shall (i) be denominated, at the relevant Borrower s option, in US Dollars, Euros or Canadian Dollars and (ii) expire no later than the earlier of (x) the first anniversary of its date of issuance and (y) the date that is five Business Days prior to the latest Termination Date under the Tranche 1 Revolving Commitments,   provided   that any Letter of Credit with a one-year term   

64 
  may provide for the automatic renewal thereof for additional one-year periods (which shall in no event extend beyond the date referred to in clause (y) above).  
 (b)  An Issuing Lender shall not at any time be obligated to issue any Letter of Credit if such issuance would conflict with, or cause such Issuing Lender or any L/C Participant to exceed any limits imposed by, any applicable Requirement of Law or contravene such Issuing Lender s internal policies.  
 (c)  On the date on which a Change of Control shall occur, the relevant Borrower shall, with respect to outstanding L/C Obligations, deposit in a non-interest bearing account opened by the Administrative Agent, an amount of cash equal to such outstanding L/C Obligations, which amount held in such account shall be held as collateral security for such Borrower s Obligations with respect to the related Letters of Credit, and any remaining amounts in such account, after satisfaction of all Obligations in respect of such L/C Obligations, shall be returned to such Borrower.  
       3.2   Procedure for Issuance of Letter of Credit .  A Borrower may from time to time request that the relevant Issuing Lender issue a Letter of Credit by delivering to such Issuing Lender at its address for notices specified herein the relevant Application therefor, completed to the reasonable satisfaction of such Issuing Lender, and such other certificates, documents and other papers and information as such Issuing Lender may reasonably request in accordance with its customary procedures.  Upon receipt of any Application, the relevant Issuing Lender will process such Application and the certificates, documents and other papers and information delivered to it in connection therewith in accordance with its customary procedures and shall promptly issue the Letter of Credit requested thereby (but in no event shall such Issuing Lender be required to issue any Letter of Credit earlier than two Business Days after its receipt of the Application therefor and all such other certificates, documents and other papers and information relating thereto) by issuing the original of such Letter of Credit to the beneficiary thereof or as otherwise may be agreed to by such Issuing Lender and the applicable Borrower.  Each Issuing Lender prior to its issuance of a Letter of Credit shall obtain confirmation from the Administrative Agent that after giving effect to such issuance, (i) the L/C Obligations would not exceed the L/C Commitment or (ii) the aggregate amount of the Revolving Extensions of Credit of the Tranche 1 Revolving Lenders outstanding at such time would not exceed the aggregate amount of Tranche 1 Revolving Commitments in effect at such time.  Such Issuing Lender shall furnish a copy of such Letter of Credit to the applicable Borrower promptly following the issuance thereof.  Each Issuing Lender shall promptly furnish to the Administrative Agent, which shall in turn promptly furnish to the Tranche 1 Revolving Lenders, notice of the issuance of each Letter of Credit (including the amount thereof).  Upon request by the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender shall report to the Administrative Agent the aggregate face amount of Letters of Credit issued by it and outstanding on any Business Day and such other information with respect to such Letters of Credit as may be requested. 
         3.3   Fees and Other Charges . 
   (a)  Each Borrower will pay a fee on all outstanding Letters of Credit issued for its account at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin then in effect with respect to Eurodollar Loans, shared ratably among the Tranche 1 Revolving Lenders and payable quarterly in arrears on each L/C Fee Payment Date after the issuance date and in US Dollars, Euros or Canadian Dollars based on the currency in which each such Letter of Credit is denominated.  Such fee shall be calculated on the aggregate undrawn face amount of the outstanding Letters of Credit on a daily basis during each quarterly or other period for which payment is made.  In addition, each Borrower shall pay to each Issuing Lender for its own account a fronting fee to be agreed upon with such Issuing Lender on the undrawn and unexpired amount of each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender for it, payable quarterly in arrears on each L/C Fee Payment Date after the issuance date of such Letter of Credit.  

65 
    (b)   In addition to the foregoing fees, each Borrower shall pay or reimburse each Issuing Lender for such normal and customary costs and expenses as are incurred or charged by such Issuing Lender in issuing, effecting payment under, amending or otherwise administering any Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender for it.  
       3.4   L/C Participations . 
   (a)  Each Issuing Lender irrevocably agrees to grant and hereby grants to each L/C Participant, and, to induce the Issuing Lender to issue Letters of Credit, each L/C Participant irrevocably agrees to accept and purchase and hereby accepts and purchases from each Issuing Lender, on the terms and conditions set forth below, for such L/C Participant s own account and risk an undivided interest equal to such L/C Participant s Tranche 1 Revolving Percentage in each Issuing Lender s obligations and rights under and in respect of each Letter of Credit and the amount of each draft paid by such Issuing Lender thereunder.  Each L/C Participant unconditionally and irrevocably agrees that, if a draft is paid under any Letter of Credit for which the relevant Issuing Lender is not reimbursed in full by the relevant Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such L/C Participant shall pay to such Issuing Lender upon demand at such Issuing Lender s address for notices specified herein an amount equal to such L/C Participant s Tranche 1 Revolving Percentage of the amount of such draft, or any part thereof, that is not so reimbursed.  
 (b)  If any amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant to the relevant Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 3.4(a) in respect of any unreimbursed portion of any payment made by such Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit is paid to such Issuing Lender within three Business Days after the date such payment is due, such L/C Participant shall pay to such Issuing Lender on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) such amount, times (ii) (x) in the case of any such amount in US Dollars, at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (A) the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate and (B) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, for the period until such L/C Participant makes such amount immediately available or (y) in the case of any such amount in Euros or Canadian Dollars, at a rate per annum determined by the Administrative Agent (such determination to be conclusive and binding on such L/C Participant) in accordance with the Administrative Agent s cost of funding the amount of such payment, for the period until such L/C Participant makes such amount immediately available to such Issuing Lender, times (iii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse during such period and the denominator of which is 360 (in the case of Euro-denominated or US Dollar-denominated Letters of Credit) or 365 (in the case of Canadian Dollar-denominated Letters of Credit).  If any such amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant pursuant to Section 3.4(a) is not made available to the relevant Issuing Lender by such L/C Participant within three Business Days after the date such payment is due, such Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover from such L/C Participant, on demand, such amount with interest thereon calculated from such due date at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans (in the case of US Dollar-denominated Letters of Credit issued for the account of a Non-Canadian Borrower), US Base Rate Loans (in the case of US Dollar-denominated Letters of Credit issued for the account of any Canadian Borrower), Canadian Prime Rate Loans (in the case of Canadian Dollar-denominated Letters of Credit) or Foreign Base Rate Loans (in the case of Euro-denominated Letters of Credit).  A certificate of the relevant Issuing Lender submitted to any L/C Participant with respect to any amounts owing under this Section shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.   
   (c)  Whenever, at any time after the relevant Issuing Lender has made payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any L/C Participant its   pro     rata   share of such payment in accordance with Section 3.4(a), such Issuing Lender receives any payment related to such Letter of Credit (whether directly from a Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of collateral applied thereto by such Issuing Lender), or any payment of interest on account thereof, such Issuing Lender will distribute,   

66 
  through the Administrative Agent to such L/C Participant its   pro rata   share thereof;   provided  ,   however  , that in the event that any such payment received by such Issuing Lender shall be required to be returned by such Issuing Lender, each such L/C Participant shall return to such Issuing Lender the portion thereof previously distributed by such Issuing Lender to it.  
                 3.5   Reimbursement Obligation of the Borrowers .  Each Borrower agrees to reimburse each Issuing Lender on the next Business Day after that on which such Issuing Lender notifies such Borrower of the date and amount of a draft presented under any Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower and paid by such Issuing Lender for the amount of (a) such draft so paid in the currency of such payment and (b) any non-Excluded Taxes, fees, charges or other costs or expenses reasonably incurred by such Issuing Lender in connection with such payment.  Each such payment shall be made to such Issuing Lender at its address for notices referred to herein in US Dollars, Euros or Canadian Dollars, as the case may be, and in immediately available funds,  provided  that the Borrowers may request in accordance with Section 2.2 that such payment be financed with US Revolving Loans, Euro Revolving Loans or Canadian Revolving Loans, as applicable, in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrowers  obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting US Revolving Loans, Euro Revolving Loans or Canadian Revolving Loans.  Interest shall be payable on any such amounts from the date on which the relevant draft is paid until payment in full (i) until the Business Day next succeeding the date of the relevant notice, (w) at the rate then applicable to ABR Loans in the case of US Dollar-denominated Letters of Credit issued for the account of a Non-Canadian Borrower, (x) at the rate then applicable to US Base Rate Loans in the case of US Dollar-denominated Letters of Credit issued for the account of any Canadian Borrower, (y) at the rate then applicable to Canadian Prime Rate Loans in the case of Canadian Dollar-denominated Letters of Credit and (z) at the rate then applicable to Foreign Base Rate Loans in the case of Euro-denominated Letters of Credit and (ii) thereafter, at the applicable rates set forth in Section 2.13(g). 
         3.6   Obligations Absolute .  Each Borrower s obligations under this Section 3 shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment that such Borrower may have or have had against any Issuing Lender, any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit or any other Person.  Each Borrower also agrees with each Issuing Lender that each Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for, and such Borrower s Reimbursement Obligations under Section 3.5 shall not be affected by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even though such documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among such Borrower and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred or any claims whatsoever of such Borrower against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee.  No Issuing Lender shall be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Issuing Lender shall be responsible to the relevant Borrower or Borrowers for errors or omissions arising from such Issuing Lender s own gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with its issuance or administration of the payment or non-payment made under or in connection with any Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender or the related drafts or documents;   provided   that, each Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by an Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or the related drafts or documents, if done in good faith in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct and in accordance with the standards of care (the   Standards of Care  ) specified in the Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, as published from time to time by the International Chamber of Commerce, shall be binding on such Borrower and shall not result in any liability of such Issuing Lender to such Borrower.  It is agreed that nothing in this paragraph shall relieve any Issuing Lender or any L/C Participant of any liability resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender or L/C Participant. 

67 
          3.7    Letter of Credit Payments  .    If any draft shall be presented for payment under any Letter of Credit, the relevant Issuing Lender shall promptly notify the applicable Borrower of the date and amount thereof.  The responsibility of an Issuing Lender to a Borrower in connection with any draft presented for payment under any Letter of Credit shall, in addition to any payment obligation expressly provided for in such Letter of Credit, be limited to determining that the documents (including each draft) delivered under such Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment are in conformity with such Letter of Credit and complying with the Standards of Care.  
           3.8   Applications .  To the extent that any provision of any Application related to any Letter of Credit is inconsistent with the provisions of this Section 3, the provisions of this Section 3 shall apply. 
         3.9   Existing Letters of Credit .  The Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Revolving Lenders and the Issuing Lenders hereby acknowledge that Existing Letters of Credit are outstanding as of the Closing Date.  It is hereby agreed among the Borrowers, the Issuing Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Revolving Lenders that concurrently with the satisfaction of the requirements of Section 5.1 on the Closing Date, the Existing Letters of Credit shall irrevocably be deemed to be Letters of Credit issued hereunder and all the provisions of this Agreement shall apply to the Existing Letters of Credit as being Letters of Credit issued hereunder by the relevant Issuing Lenders, the whole without novation of all of the obligations of the Borrowers to each relevant Issuing Lender in respect of said Existing Letters of Credit.

The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders);  provided  that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders. 
       9.6   Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders .  Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Agents nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys in fact or affiliates have made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by any Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs the Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent to any Lender.  Each Lender represents to the Agents that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrowers and their affiliates and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrowers and their affiliates.  Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Borrowers that may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys in fact or affiliates. 
             9.7   Indemnification .  The Lenders severally agree to indemnify each Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrowers and without limiting the obligation of the Borrowers to do so), ratably according to their respective Aggregate Exposure Percentages in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought under this Section 9.7, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time (whether before or after the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of, the Revolving Commitments, the Loans, this Agreement, or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or the transactions contemplated hereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent under or in connection  

89 
  with any of the foregoing;   provided   that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements that result from such Agent s gross negligence or willful misconduct.  The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.  
       9.8   Agent in Its Individual Capacity .  Each Agent and its affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with the Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries as though such Agent were not an Agent.  With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it and with respect to any Letter of Credit issued or participated in by it, each Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the terms  Lender  and  Lenders  shall include each Agent in its individual capacity. 
           9.9   Successor Administrative Agent .  The Administrative Agent may resign as the Administrative Agent upon 10 days  notice to the Lenders and the Borrowers.  If (i) the Administrative Agent shall resign as the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, then the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall (unless an Event of Default under Section 8(h) or 8(i) with respect to a Borrower shall have occurred and be continuing) be subject to approval by the Parent Borrower (which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) or (ii) if no successor agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date that is 10 days following a retiring Administrative Agent s notice of resignation, such retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor agent, which successor agent shall (unless an Event of Default under Section 8(h) or 8(i) with respect to a Borrower shall have occurred and be continuing) be subject to approval by the Parent Borrower (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); then, in either case, the successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent, and the term       Administrative Agent    shall mean such successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the former Administrative Agent s rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any holders of the Loans.  After any retiring Administrative Agent s resignation as Administrative Agent becomes effective the provisions of this Section 9 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Administrative Agent under this Agreement. 
       9.10   Documentation Agents and Syndication Agents .  Neither the Documentation Agents nor the Syndication Agents shall have any duties or responsibilities hereunder in their capacities as such.

In the case of any waiver, the Borrowers, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall be restored to their former position and rights hereunder, and any Default or Event of Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default, or impair any right consequent thereon.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any waiver, amendment or modification of this Agreement that by its terms affects the rights or duties under this Agreement of Lenders holding Loans or Revolving Commitments of a particular Class (but not the Lenders holding Loans or Revolving Commitments of any other Class) may be effected by an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrowers and the requisite percentage in interest of the affected Class of Lenders that would be required to consent thereto under this Section   10.1   if such Class of Lenders were the only Class of Lenders hereunder at the time.

           10.6   Successors and Assigns; Participations and Assignments . 
   (a)  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrowers, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent, all future holders of the Loans and their respective successors and assigns, except that no Borrower may assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this   

95 
  Agreement without the prior written consent of each Lender (except for any assignment by a Canadian Borrower, a Spanish Borrower or a Swedish Borrower as permitted by Section   7.3  ) and Lenders may sell participations in or assign all or any part of their rights and obligations in respect of Loans only as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) below, respectively, or pursuant to Section   2.23  .  
     (b)  Any Lender other than any Conduit Lender may, without the consent of any other party to this Agreement, in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one or more Eligible Assignees (each, a    Participant   ) participating interests in any Loan owing to such Lender, any Revolving Commitment of such Lender or any other interest of such Lender hereunder.  In the event of any such sale by a Lender of a participating interest to a Participant, such Lender s obligations under this Agreement to the other parties to this Agreement shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible for the performance thereof, such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Loan for all purposes under this Agreement, and the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement.  In no event shall any Participant under any such participation have any right to approve any amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, or any consent to any departure by any Borrower therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment, waiver or consent would reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Loans or any fees payable hereunder, or postpone the date of the final maturity of the Loans, in each case to the extent subject to such participation.  Each Borrower agrees that if amounts outstanding under this Agreement and the Loans are due or unpaid, or shall have been declared or shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each Participant shall, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, be deemed to have the right of setoff in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under this Agreement,   provided   that, in purchasing such participating interest, neither such Participant, on the one hand, nor the Borrowers nor the Administrative Agent, on the other hand, shall have any rights against or obligations to one another, nor shall any of them be required to deal directly with one another in respect of, the participation of such Participant.  Each Borrower also agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.17, 2.18 and 2.19 (and subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 2.18(f) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.18(f) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) with respect to its participation in the Revolving Commitments and the Loans outstanding from time to time as if it was a Lender;        provided    that, in the case of Section 2.18, such Participant shall have complied with the requirements of said Section as if it were a Lender and         provided   ,   further  , that no Participant shall be entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to any such Section than the transferor Lender would have been entitled to receive in respect of the amount of the participation transferred by such transferor Lender to such Participant had no such transfer occurred.  For the avoidance of doubt, no Loan Party shall be required to pay any greater amount pursuant to Section 2.18 as a result of the transfer of a participation to a Participant than such Loan Party would have been required to pay absent such transfer.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the    Participant Register      provided   that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations or, in the case of any Canadian Borrower, to establish that such Participant dealt at arm s length with such Canadian Borrower for purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) or, in the case of any Spanish Borrower, to establish that any transaction between the Participant and the Spanish Borrower is in compliance with the Spanish transfer pricings rules, when applicable, for the purposes of Law 27/2014, of 27 November, on Corporate Income   

96 
  Tax and Law 35/2006, of 28 November, on Personal Income Tax  .  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.    For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.  
   (c)  Any Lender other than any Conduit Lender (an    Assignor   ) shall be permitted to assign, in accordance with applicable law, all or a portion of its Loans and Revolving Commitments hereunder to an Eligible Assignee (an    Assignee   ) with the consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, of (a) the Parent Borrower, unless (i) the Assignee is a Lender or a Lender Affiliate or (ii) an Event of Default under Section 8(a) or 8(b), or 8(h) or 8(i) (with respect to a Borrower), has occurred and is continuing;       provided    that such consent shall be deemed given if the Parent Borrower has not responded within 15 days of a written request from the Administrative Agent for such consent, (b) the Administrative Agent, and (c) each Issuing Lender, in each case pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption, executed by such Assignee, such Assignor and any other Person whose consent is required pursuant to this paragraph, and delivered to the Administrative Agent for its acceptance and recording in the relevant Register (it being understood and agreed that such Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an administrative questionnaire in which the Assignee designates one or more credit contacts to whom all syndicate-level information (which may contain material non-public information about the Parent Borrower and its Affiliates and their related parties or their respective securities) will be made available and who may receive such information in accordance with the assignee s compliance procedures and applicable laws, including Federal and state securities laws);   provided   that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents, no Lender shall be entitled, without the consent of the Parent Borrower, to make an assignment under this Section 10.6(c) if such assignment would increase the cost under this Agreement to any Borrower, including without limitation under Section 2.17 or 2.18, as of the date of such assignment or if, as of the date of such assignment, such assignment would increase the cost under this Agreement to any Borrower in the foreseeable future.  Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording in the Register pursuant to Section 10.6(d), from and after the effective date determined pursuant to such Assignment and Assumption, (x) the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent provided in such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder with a Revolving Commitment and/or Loans as set forth therein, and (y) the Assignor thereunder shall, to the extent provided in such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of an Assignor s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Assignor shall cease to be a party hereto).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Conduit Lender may assign at any time to its designating Lender hereunder without the consent of any Borrower or the Administrative Agent any or all of the Loans it may have funded hereunder and pursuant to its designation agreement and without regard to the limitations set forth in the first sentence of this Section 10.6(c).   
     (d)  The Administrative Agent shall, on behalf of the Borrowers, maintain at its address referred to in Section 10.2 a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register (each, a     Register    ) for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Revolving Commitment of, and the principal amount (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender from time to time.  The entries in each Register shall constitute   prima facie   evidence of the same, in the absence of manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in each Register as the owner of the Loans and any Notes evidencing the Loans recorded therein for all purposes of this Agreement.  Any assignment of any Loan, whether or not evidenced by a Note, shall be effective only upon appropriate entries with respect thereto being made in the relevant Register (and each Note shall expressly so provide).  Any assignment or transfer of all or part of a Loan evidenced by a Note shall be registered on the relevant Register only upon surrender for   

97 
  registration of assignment or transfer of the Note evidencing such Loan, accompanied by a duly executed Assignment and Assumption, and thereupon one or more new Notes may be issued to the designated Assignee, if requested by such Assignee.  
   (e)  Except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, a Lender Affiliate or a Conduit Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender s Revolving Commitments or Loans within any Class, the amount of the Revolving Commitments or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than (x) in the case of an assignment of Revolving Commitments, US$5,000,000 or (y) in the case of an assignment of Loans, US$5,000,000, C$5,000,000 or  5,000,000, as applicable, in each case unless the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent,   provided   that (1) no such consent of the Parent Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default under Section 8(a) or 8(b), or Section 8(h) or 8(i) has occurred and is continuing and (2) such amounts shall be aggregated in respect of each Lender and its Lender Affiliates or Conduit Lenders, if any.   
 (f)  Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Assumption in conformity with Section 10.6(c), executed by an Assignor, an Assignee and any other Person whose consent is required by Section 10.6(c), together with payment to the Administrative Agent of a registration and processing fee of US$3,500, the Administrative Agent shall (i) promptly accept such Assignment and Assumption and (ii) record the information contained therein in the relevant Register on the effective date determined pursuant thereto.   
 (g)  For avoidance of doubt the parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the provisions of this Section 10.6 concerning assignments relate only to absolute assignments and that such provisions do not prohibit the granting of security, including any pledge or assignment by a Lender to any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with applicable law;    provided    that the foreclosure on any such pledged Loan shall be subject to the provisions regarding restrictions on assignments contained in this Section 10.6.   
 (h)  Each Borrower, upon receipt of written notice from the relevant Lender, agrees to issue Notes to any Lender requiring Notes to facilitate transactions of the type described in paragraph (g) above.
