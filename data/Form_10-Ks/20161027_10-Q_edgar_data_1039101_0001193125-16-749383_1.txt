  AND L-3 COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION   
    NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED   
  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
  1.  Description of Business   
 L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. derives all of its operating income and cash flows from its wholly-owned subsidiary, L-3
Communications Corporation (L-3 Communications). L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. (L-3 Holdings and, together with its subsidiaries, referred to herein as L-3 or the Company) is a prime contractor in Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance
(ISR) systems, aircraft sustainment (including modifications, logistics and maintenance), simulation and training, night vision and image intensification equipment, and security and detection systems. L-3 is also a leading provider of a broad range
of communication and electronic systems and products used on military and commercial platforms. The Company s customers include the United States (U.S.) Department of Defense (DoD) and its prime contractors, U.S. Government
intelligence agencies, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), foreign governments, and domestic and international commercial customers.  
 On December 7, 2015, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its National Security Solutions (NSS)
business to CACI International Inc. The transaction was completed on February 1, 2016. NSS provides cybersecurity solutions, high-performance computing, enterprise IT services, analytics and intelligence analysis to the DoD, U.S. Government
intelligence agencies, federal civilian agencies and foreign governments. In accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-08,  Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity , the assets and
liabilities and results of operations of NSS are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Accordingly, all references made to financial data in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are to the Company s continuing operations,
unless specifically noted. See Note 5 for additional information.    The Company has the following three reportable
segments: (1) Electronic Systems, (2) Aerospace Systems and (3) Communication Systems. Electronic Systems provides a broad range of components, products, subsystems, systems, and related services for military and commercial customers
in several niche markets across several business areas. These business areas include precision engagement   training, sensor systems, power   propulsion systems, aviation products   security systems, warrior systems and
advanced programs. Aerospace Systems delivers integrated solutions for the global ISR market and provides modernization, upgrade, sustainment, and maintenance and logistics support for a wide variety of aircraft and ground systems. Communication
Systems delivers products and services for the global communications market, specializing in strategic and tactical airborne, space, ground and sea-based communication systems.  
 Financial information with respect to the Company s segments is included in Note 22 to the unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements and in Note 21 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
  2.  Basis of Presentation   
 These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarterly and year-to-date periods ended September 23, 2016
should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of  L-3  Holdings and L-3 Communications included in their Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
   Principles of Consolidation and Reporting    
 The accompanying financial statements comprise the consolidated financial statements of L-3 Holdings and L-3 Communications.
L-3 Holdings  only asset is its investment in the common stock of L-3 Communications, its wholly-owned subsidiary, and its only obligations are: (1) its guarantee of borrowings under the Amended and
 
      7  

Table of Contents  

L-3 COMMUNICATIONS HOLDINGS, INC.   
  AND L-3 COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION   
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED   
  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (continued)       
  
Restated Revolving Credit Facility (Credit Facility) of L-3 Communications and (2) its guarantee of other contractual obligations of L-3 Communications and its subsidiaries. All issuances of
and conversions into L-3 Holdings  equity securities, including grants of stock options, restricted stock units and performance units by L-3 Holdings to employees and directors of L-3 Communications and its subsidiaries, have been reflected in
the consolidated financial statements of L-3 Communications. As a result, the consolidated financial positions, results of operations and cash flows of L-3 Holdings and L-3 Communications are substantially the same. See Note 24 for additional
information regarding the unaudited financial information of L-3 Communications and its subsidiaries.    The unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form
10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Accordingly, they do not include all of the disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for a complete set of annual audited financial statements. The December 31,
2015 condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal and recurring adjustments)
considered necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented have been included. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year.  
 It is generally the Company s established practice to close its books for the quarters ending March, June and September
on the Friday preceding the end of the calendar quarter. The interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared and are labeled based on that convention. The Company closes its books for annual periods
on December 31 regardless of what day it falls on.    Certain reclassifications have been made to conform prior-year
amounts to the current-year presentation.      Accounting Estimates    
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and costs of sales during the reporting period. The most
significant of these estimates and assumptions for L-3 relate to contract revenue, profit and loss recognition, fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, market values for inventories reported at lower of cost
or market, pension and post-retirement benefit obligations, stock-based employee compensation expense, income taxes, including the valuation of deferred tax assets, litigation reserves and environmental obligations, accrued product warranty costs,
liabilities for the voluntary return program of various EoTech holographic weapons sight (HWS) products, and the recoverability, useful lives and valuation of recorded amounts of long-lived assets, identifiable intangible assets and goodwill.
Changes in estimates are reflected in the periods during which they become known. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and could differ materially.  
 Sales and profits on contracts that are covered by accounting standards for construction-type and production-type contracts
and federal government contractors are substantially recognized using percentage-of-completion (POC) methods of accounting. Approximately 49% of the Company s net sales in 2015 were accounted for under contract accounting standards, of which
approximately 41% were fixed-price type contracts and approximately 8% were cost-plus type contracts. For contracts that are accounted for under contract  
      8

L-3 COMMUNICATIONS HOLDINGS, INC.   
  AND L-3 COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION   
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED   
  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (continued)       
  
accounting standards, sales and profits are recognized based on: (1) a POC method of accounting (fixed-price type contracts), (2) allowable costs incurred plus the estimated profit on
those costs (cost-plus type contracts), or (3) direct labor hours expended multiplied by the contractual fixed rate per hour plus incurred costs for material (time-and-material type contracts). Sales and profits on fixed-price production
contracts under which units are produced and delivered in a continuous or sequential process are recorded as units are delivered based on their contractual selling prices (the  units-of-delivery  method). Sales and profits on each
fixed-price production contract under which units are not produced and delivered in a continuous or sequential process, or under which a relatively few number of units are produced, are recorded based on the ratio of actual cumulative costs incurred
to total estimated costs at completion of the contract, multiplied by the total estimated contract revenue, less cumulative sales recognized in prior periods (the  cost-to-cost  method). Under both POC methods of accounting, a single
estimated total profit margin is used to recognize profit for each contract over its entire period of performance, which can exceed one year.  
 Accounting for the sales and profits on these fixed-price type contracts requires the preparation of estimates of:
(1) the total contract revenue, (2) the total costs at completion, which is equal to the sum of the actual incurred costs to date on the contract and the estimated costs to complete the contract s statement of work, and (3) the
measurement of progress towards completion. The estimated profit or loss at completion on a contract is equal to the difference between the total estimated contract revenue and the total estimated cost at completion. The profit recorded on a
contract in any period using either the units-of-delivery method or cost-to-cost method is equal to the current estimated total profit margin multiplied by the cumulative sales recognized, less the amount of cumulative profit previously recorded for
the contract.    Sales and profits on cost-plus type contracts that are covered by contract accounting standards are
recognized as allowable costs are incurred on the contract, at an amount equal to the allowable costs plus the estimated profit on those costs. The estimated profit on a cost-plus type contract is fixed or variable based on the contractual fee
arrangement. Incentive and award fees are the primary variable fee contractual arrangement types for the Company. Incentive and award fees on cost-plus type contracts are included as an element of total estimated contract revenues and are recorded
as sales when a basis exists for the reasonable prediction of performance in relation to established contractual targets and the Company is able to make reasonably dependable estimates for them.  
 Sales and profits on time-and-material type contracts are recognized on the basis of direct labor hours expended multiplied by
the contractual fixed rate per hour, plus the actual costs of materials and other direct non-labor costs.    Revisions or
adjustments to estimates for a contract s revenue, estimated costs at completion and estimated profit or loss are often required as work progresses under a contract, as experience is gained, as facts and circumstances change and as new
information is obtained, even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change. Revisions or adjustments may also be required if contract modifications occur. The impact of revisions in profit (loss) estimates for all types of
contracts subject to POC accounting are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period in which the revisions are made. The revisions in contract estimates, if significant, can materially affect the Company s results of operations and

of consolidated operating income ($1.03 per diluted share) for the year-to-date period ended September 23, 2016, and increases of $50 million, or 9%, of consolidated operating income ($0.49 per diluted share) for the year-to-date period ended

  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (continued)       
  As previously disclosed, during the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company
commenced a voluntary return program and began accepting customer returns for various EoTech HWS products that may have been affected by certain performance issues. The return program gives eligible owners of such HWS products the option to return
their products in exchange for a refund of the purchase price, including shipping costs. The Company initially recorded a reduction to net sales of $20 million in the Warrior Systems sector of the Electronic Systems segment in the fourth quarter of
2015, associated with establishing a product returns allowance to reflect the estimated cost of the return program. Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, with the benefit of a larger volume of actual refund transactions, the Company began using a
statistical analysis of the voluntary return program to estimate the number and cost of future refunds. In its statistical analysis, the Company utilized empirical models to forecast the expected emergence pattern of new refunds over time to produce
a probabilistic distribution of new refund costs that reflects the existing level of estimation uncertainty. Based on this analysis, the Company expects the total cost of the voluntary return program to be approximately $36 million. The Company
recorded the $16 million increase in the product returns allowance as a reduction to net sales during 2016. The product returns allowance, net of refund payments made to eligible owners, was $8 million at September 23, 2016, and is included in
other current liabilities on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of October 20, 2016, the Company had approved refunds at a cost of approximately $32 million, with an average refund cost per unit of $500. The Company
will continue to monitor the product returns allowance. The Company s ongoing evaluation may cause it to record further adjustments to the allowance in future periods. These adjustments could be material. Furthermore, during the third quarter
of 2016, the Company recorded a $14 million pre-tax charge in the Electronics Systems segment for a settlement in principle of the class action litigation, which is subject to court approval, in connection with the EoTech HWS. See Note 18,
 Commitments and Contingencies  for further details regarding the class action litigation.    For a more complete
discussion of these estimates and assumptions, see the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.     3.  New Accounting
Standards Implemented     In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2016-09 ,
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payments, including the income tax consequences and classification on the statement of cash flows. Under the new
standard, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies will be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur. Additionally, excess tax benefits will be classified as
an operating activity on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods, and early adoption is permitted. The amendments requiring
recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement must be applied prospectively, and entities may elect to apply the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows using
either a prospective or retrospective transition method. Effective January 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2016-09 and applied the amendments relating to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows using a retrospective
transition method. See Note 11 for additional information.     4.  Accounting Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented   
 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15 , Statement of Cash Flows   Classification of Certain Cash
Receipts and Cash Payments , which provides guidance regarding cash flow statement classification of: (1) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, (2) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt

instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, (3) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination,
(4) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, (5) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, (6) distributions received from equity method investees, (7) beneficial interests in securitization transactions, and
(8) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. The new standard will be effective for the Company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The
adoption of this standard will not have an impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations, however, the Company expects that there may be an immaterial reclassification of items within the operating, investing and financing
activities on its statement of cash flows. The Company plans to early adopt this standard in the fourth quarter of 2016.  
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases , which updates the existing guidance on accounting for leases and
requires new qualitative and quantitative disclosures about the Company s leasing activities. The new standard requires the Company to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases under which the Company is
the lessee, including those classified as operating leases under previous accounting guidance. The new standard allows the Company to make an accounting policy election not to recognize on the balance sheet lease assets and liabilities for leases
with a term of 12 months or less. The accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged from previous guidance. The new standard, as amended, will be effective for the Company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on January 1,
2019, with early adoption permitted. In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The modified retrospective approach
includes a number of optional practical expedients that the Company may elect to apply. The Company is currently evaluating the expected impact of the adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which will replace numerous
requirements in U.S. GAAP, including industry-specific requirements, provide companies with a single revenue recognition model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers and significantly expand the disclosure requirements for revenue
arrangements. The new standard, as amended, will be effective for the Company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2018, with early application permitted beginning on January 1, 2017. The two permitted
transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying
the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application with disclosure of results under the new and old standards for the first year of adoption.  
 The Company has made progress toward completing its evaluation of the potential changes from adopting this new standard on its
financial reporting and disclosures. The Company has evaluated the impact of the standard on all of its revenue streams and most of its contracts. The Company expects to complete the contract evaluations and validate the results by the first quarter
of 2017. The Company has also made significant progress on drafting its accounting policies and evaluating the new disclosure requirements. The Company expects to complete the evaluation of the impact of the accounting and disclosure changes on its
business processes, controls and systems during the first half of 2017, design any changes to such business processes, controls and systems by the middle of 2017, and implement the changes over the remainder of 2017.  
 Under the new standard, an entity recognizes revenue when or as it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a good
or service to the customer, either at a point in time or over time. The Company expects to

recognize revenue over time on most of its contracts that are covered by contract accounting standards using cost inputs to measure progress toward completion of its performance obligations,
which is similar to the POC cost-to-cost method currently used on certain of these contracts. The Company currently recognizes sales on fixed-priced production contracts that are covered by contract accounting standards, and under which units are
produced and delivered in a continuous or sequential process as units are delivered, based on their contractual selling prices (units-of-delivery method). The Company expects to discontinue the use of the units-of-delivery method under the new
standard. Approximately 50% of the Company s net sales are generated from revenue arrangements accounted for under contract accounting standards, including approximately 15% that use the units-of-delivery method. While the Company is currently
evaluating the expected impact of the adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements, related disclosures and the transition alternatives available, the Company will adopt the standard as of January 1, 2018. Furthermore, the
Company expects to determine the transition method and the effect of this standard on the Company s consolidated financial statements in the first quarter of 2017.  
 Other accounting standard updates effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 31, 2016 are not
expected to have an impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.     5.  Divestitures and Acquisitions
      Discontinued Operations    
 As discussed in Note 1, on February 1, 2016, the Company completed the sale of its NSS business to CACI International Inc.
for a sales price of $547 million. The sales price was finalized as of September 23, 2016, with no significant changes to preliminary amounts.  
 The table below presents statements of operations data for NSS, which was previously a reportable segment and has been
classified as a discontinued operation and includes allocated interest expense for debt not directly attributable or related to L-3 s other operations. Interest expense was allocated in accordance with the accounting standards for discontinued
operations and was based on the ratio of NSS s net assets to the sum of: (1) total L-3 consolidated net assets and (2) L-3 consolidated total debt.      

(1)  
     The year-to-date period ended September 23, 2016 includes
a gain of $64 million (before and after income taxes) on the sale of the NSS business.

  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (continued)       

(1)  
     The net increase in goodwill for the Electronic Systems
segment was due to the final purchase price allocations for the ForceX, Inc. and CTC Aviation Group business acquisitions. The increase in goodwill for the Communication Systems segment was due to the ATM, Inc. business acquisition.

(2)  
     The decrease in goodwill presented in the Electronic
Systems segment was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound, partially offset by the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar and the Euro during the year-to-date period ended September 23, 2016. The
increase in goodwill presented in the Aerospace Systems segment was due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar during the year-to-date period ended September 23, 2016.     
  Identifiable Intangible Assets.  The most significant identifiable intangible asset that is separately recognized
for the Company s business acquisitions is customer contractual relationships. All of the Company s customer relationships are established through written customer contracts (revenue arrangements). The fair value for customer contractual
relationships is determined, as of the date of acquisition, based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the estimated future after-tax earnings and cash flows (including cash flows for working capital) arising from the follow-on
sales on contract (revenue arrangement) renewals expected from the customer contractual relationships over their estimated lives, including the probability of expected future contract renewals and sales, less a contributory assets charge, all of
which is discounted to present value.     Identifiable Intangible Assets.  The table below presents information for the

     During the year-to-date period ended September 23, 2016,
L-3 Communications  aggregate borrowings and repayments under the Credit Facility were each $335 million. At September 23, 2016, L-3 Communications had the full availability of its $1 billion Credit Facility, which expires on February 3,
2017.       On March 24, 2016, the Company initiated a redemption of $300 million aggregate principal
amount of its $500 million 3.95% Senior Notes due November 15, 2016 (the 2016 Notes). The redemption price was determined on May 17, 2016 at 101.475% of the principal amount thereof (Redemption Price). Interest on the 2016 Notes redeemed ceased to
accrue on and after May 20, 2016 (Redemption Date) and the only remaining right of holders of such 2016 Notes was to receive payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest. On May 20, 2016, the Company completed the partial redemption and
recognized a debt retirement charge of $5 million. Following the partial redemption of the 2016 Notes, $200 million aggregate principal amount of the 2016 Notes remain outstanding.  
 In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03 which requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a
direct deduction from the carrying amount of the associated debt liability. The Company adopted this standard during the first quarter of 2016.  
  11.  Income Taxes   
 The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. Federal jurisdiction, which is the Company s
primary tax jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. At September 23, 2016, the

statutes of limitations for the Company s U.S. Federal income tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2010 through 2015 were open. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
commenced an audit of the Company s U.S. Federal income tax return for 2012. The Company cannot predict the outcome of the audit at this time.  
 The effective income tax rate for the year-to-date period ended September 23, 2016 decreased to 21.7% from 22.9% for the
year-to-date period ended September 25, 2015. The year-to-date period ended September 23, 2016 includes: (1) a benefit from the reinstatement of the Federal Research and Experimentation tax credit, (2) tax benefits of $21 million for the reversal of
previously accrued amounts related to various U.S. Federal, foreign and state tax matters and (3) $16 million due to the early adoption of a new accounting standard related to income tax benefits from employee stock-based compensation awards (see
Note 3). The year-to-date period ended September 25, 2015 included $36 million of tax benefits, including: (1) $17 million related to a legal restructuring of the Company s foreign entities, (2) $10 million related to the
resolution of various outstanding income tax matters with U.S. and foreign tax authorities, and (3) $9 million primarily associated with the release of valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets. As of September 23, 2016, the Company
anticipates that unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $6 million over the next 12 months due to the potential resolution of unrecognized tax benefits involving several jurisdictions and tax periods. The actual amount of the
decrease over the next 12 months could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements.  
 Current and non-current income taxes payable include accrued potential interest of $10 million ($6 million after income
taxes) at September 23, 2016 and $18 million ($11 million after income taxes) at December 31, 2015, and potential penalties of $8 million at September 23, 2016 and $9 million at December 31, 2015.

  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (continued)       
   13.  Equity   
 On December 4, 2014, L-3 Holdings  Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program that authorizes L-3
Holdings to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of its common stock through June 30, 2017. Repurchases of L-3 Holdings  common stock are made from time to time at management s discretion in accordance with applicable U.S. Federal
securities laws. The timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the Company s financial position, earnings, legal requirements, other investment
opportunities (including acquisitions) and market conditions. L-3 Holdings repurchased 2,677,840 shares of its common stock at an average price of $121.58 per share for an aggregate amount of $326 million from January 1, 2016 through September
23, 2016. All share repurchases of L-3 Holdings  common stock have been recorded as treasury shares.    At
September 23, 2016, the remaining dollar value of authorization under the December 4, 2014 share repurchase program was $480 million.  
 From September 24, 2016 through October 21, 2016, L-3 Holdings repurchased 112,846 shares of its common stock at an
average price of $150.63 per share for an aggregate amount of $17 million.    On June 21, 2016, L-3 Holdings  Board of
Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.70 per share, paid on September 15, 2016 to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 17, 2016. During the year-to-date period ended September 23, 2016, the Company paid $166
million of cash dividends, including a $1 million net reduction of previously accrued dividends for employee held stock awards.  
 On October 18, 2016, L-3 Holdings  Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share, payable on

  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (continued)       
   15.  Fair Value Measurements   
 L-3 applies the accounting standards for fair value measurements to all of the Company s assets and liabilities that are
measured and recorded at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between
market participants. The standards establish a fair value hierarchy that gives the highest priority to observable inputs and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.  
 The following table presents the fair value hierarchy level for each of the Company s assets and liabilities that are
measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.      

(1)   
   Level 1 is based on quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of
the reporting date. Cash equivalents are primarily held in registered money market funds, which are valued using quoted market prices.         

(2)   
   Level 2 is based on pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or
indirectly observable. The fair value is determined using a valuation model based on observable market inputs, including quoted foreign currency forward exchange rates and consideration of non-performance risk.     

(3)   
   Level 3 is based on pricing inputs that are not observable and not corroborated by market data. The Company has
no Level 3 assets or liabilities.        16.  Financial Instruments   
 At September 23, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s financial instruments consisted primarily of cash and cash
equivalents, billed receivables, trade accounts payable, Senior Notes and foreign currency forward contracts. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, billed receivables and trade accounts payable are representative of their respective
fair values because of the short-term maturities or the expected settlement dates of these instruments. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company s other financial instruments are presented in the table below.  

(1)   
   The Company measures the fair value of its Senior Notes using Level 2 inputs based primarily on current market
yields for its existing debt traded in the secondary market.         

(2)   
   The Company measures the fair values of foreign currency forward contracts based on forward exchange rates. See
Note 17 for additional disclosures regarding the notional amounts and fair values of foreign currency forward contracts.

   17.  Derivative Financial Instruments   
 The Company s derivative financial instruments include foreign currency forward contracts, which are entered into for risk
management purposes.     Foreign Currency Forward Contracts.  The Company s U.S. and foreign businesses enter
into contracts with customers, subcontractors or vendors that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. To protect the functional currency equivalent cash flows associated with certain of these contracts, the Company
enters into foreign currency forward contracts. The Company s activities involving foreign currency forward contracts are designed to hedge the changes in the functional currency equivalent cash flows due to movements in foreign exchange rates
compared to the functional currency. The foreign currencies hedged are primarily the Canadian dollar, the U.S. dollar, the Euro and the British pound. The Company manages exposure to counterparty non-performance credit risk by entering into foreign
currency forward contracts only with major financial institutions that are expected to fully perform under the terms of such contracts. Foreign currency forward contracts are recorded in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets at
fair value and are generally designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities. Gains and losses on designated foreign currency forward contracts that are
highly effective in offsetting the corresponding change in the cash flows of the hedged transactions are recorded net of income taxes in AOCI and then recognized in income when the underlying hedged transaction affects income. Gains and losses on
foreign currency forward contracts that do not meet hedge accounting criteria are recognized in income immediately. Notional amounts are used to measure the volume of foreign currency forward contracts and do not represent exposure to foreign
currency losses. The table below presents the notional amounts of the Company s outstanding foreign currency forward contracts by currency at September 23, 2016.      
   At September 23, 2016, the Company s foreign currency forward contracts had maturities
through 2020.

   See Note 15 for a description of the fair value hierarchy related to the Company s foreign currency
forward contracts.       The effects from foreign currency forward contracts on the unaudited condensed
consolidated statements of operations were pre-tax losses of $4 million for each of the quarterly periods ended September 23, 2016 and September 25, 2015, and $8 million and $12 million for the year-to-date periods ended September 23, 2016 and
September 25, 2015, respectively. At September 23, 2016, the estimated net amount of existing losses that are expected to be reclassified into income within the next 12 months is $1 million.  
  18.  Commitments and Contingencies   
   Procurement Regulations    
 A substantial majority of the Company s revenues are generated from providing products and services under legally binding
agreements or contracts with the U.S. Government, foreign government customers and state and local governments. U.S. Government contracts are subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements, and, from time to time, agencies of the U.S.
Government investigate whether such contracts were and are being conducted in accordance with these requirements. The Company is currently cooperating with the U.S. Government on several investigations from which civil, criminal or administrative
proceedings have or could result and give rise to fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages, restitution and/or forfeitures, including investigations into the pricing of certain contracts entered into by the Communication Systems segment.
The Company does not currently anticipate that any of these investigations will have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, under U.S.
Government regulations, an indictment of the Company by a federal grand jury, or an administrative finding against the Company as to its present responsibility to be a U.S. Government contractor or subcontractor, could result in the Company being
suspended for a period of time from eligibility for awards of new government contracts or task orders or in a loss of export privileges. A conviction, or an administrative finding against the Company that satisfies the requisite level of
seriousness, could result in debarment from contracting with the federal government for a specified term. In addition, all of the Company s U.S. Government contracts: (1) are subject to audit and various pricing and cost controls,
(2) include standard provisions for termination for the convenience of the U.S. Government or for default and (3) are subject to cancellation if funds for contracts become unavailable. Foreign government contracts generally include
comparable provisions relating to terminations for convenience or default, as well as other procurement clauses relevant to the foreign government.

  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (continued)       
    Litigation Matters    
 The Company is also subject to litigation, proceedings, claims or assessments and various contingent liabilities incidental to
its businesses, including those specified below. Furthermore, in connection with certain business acquisitions, the Company has assumed some or all claims against, and liabilities of, such acquired businesses, including both asserted and unasserted
claims and liabilities.    In accordance with the accounting standard for contingencies, the Company records a liability
when management believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the Company can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss. Generally, the loss is recorded at the amount the Company expects to resolve the liability. The
estimated amounts of liabilities recorded for pending and threatened litigation are disclosed in Note 9. Amounts recoverable from insurance contracts or third parties are recorded as assets when deemed probable. At September 23, 2016, the
Company did not record any amounts for recoveries from insurance contracts or third parties in connection with the amount of liabilities recorded for pending and threatened litigation. Legal defense costs are expensed as incurred. The Company
believes it has recorded adequate provisions for its litigation matters. The Company reviews these provisions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a
particular matter. While it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome may occur in one or more of the following matters, unless otherwise stated below, the Company believes that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of
these matters. With respect to the litigation matters below for which it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome may occur, an estimate of loss or range of loss is disclosed when such amount or amounts can be reasonably estimated.
Although the Company believes that it has valid defenses with respect to legal matters and investigations pending against it, the results of litigation can be difficult to predict, particularly those involving jury trials. Therefore, it is possible
that one or more of the following or other contingencies could have a material impact on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company in future periods.  
  EoTech Class Actions.  In December 2015 and February 2016, three putative class action complaints against the Company
were filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri and the United States District Court of the District of Oregon. In March 2016, two additional putative class action complaints were filed in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, which assert similar claims against the Company. In August of 2016, all five cases were consolidated into a single, putative class action in the United States District Court for the Western
District of Missouri. The complaints allege that the Company s EoTech business unit knowingly sold defective holographic weapons sights, and seek monetary damages, pre- and post-judgment interest, and fees and expenses based on claims including
breach of warranty, fraud, violation of state consumer protection statutes and unjust enrichment. In October 2016, the parties reached a settlement in principle to resolve the allegations in these cases. The proposed settlement is subject to court
approval. The anticipated costs of this settlement are reflected in the Company s financial results.     Securities
Class Action.  In August 2014, three separate, putative class actions were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the District Court) against the Company and certain of its officers. These cases were
consolidated into a single action on October 24, 2014. A consolidated amended complaint was filed in the District Court on December 22, 2014, which was further amended and restated on March 13, 2015. The complaint alleges violations
of federal securities laws related to misconduct and accounting errors identified by the Company at its Aerospace Systems segment, and seeks monetary damages, pre- and post-

judgment interest, and fees and expenses. On March 30, 2016, the District Court dismissed with prejudice all claims against the Company s officers and allowed the claim against the
Company to proceed to discovery. Discovery has commenced. On June 30, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, which is pending before the District Court. The Company believes the suit lacks merit and intends to defend itself
vigorously. The Company is unable to reasonably estimate any amount or range of loss, if any, that may be incurred in connection with this matter because the proceedings are in their early stages.  
  Government Inquiries . On July 30, 2014, the Company voluntarily contacted the SEC to report information concerning
its internal review related to misconduct and accounting errors identified by the Company at its Aerospace Systems segment. The Company has received requests for interviews of current and former employees, and subpoenas for documents and other
materials from the SEC and the Department of Justice concerning these self-reported matters. The Company is fully cooperating with both agencies and is currently in discussions with the government regarding a possible settlement. The Company does
not currently believe that any such settlement will have a material financial impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows in future periods.  
  401(k) Plan Class Action . On June 24, 2016, a putative class action was filed in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York on behalf of participants in and beneficiaries of a Company-sponsored 401(k) plan. An amended complaint was filed on September 29, 2016. As amended, the complaint alleges that certain of the Company s
officers breached fiduciary duties owed under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by making the Company s stock available as an investment alternative under the plan during a period prior to the disclosure of misconduct and accounting
errors identified by the Company at its Aerospace Systems segment. The complaint seeks, among other things, monetary damages, equitable relief, pre-judgment interest, and fees and expenses. The Company believes the suit lacks merit and intends to
defend against it vigorously. The Company is unable to reasonably estimate any amount or range of loss, if any, that may be incurred in connection with this matter because the proceedings are in their early stages.  
  Derivative Action.  On July 13, 2016, a shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the Supreme Court of New York,
County of New York, against certain of the Company s current and former directors and officers. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants breached fiduciary duties, caused corporate waste and were unjustly enriched in
connection with misconduct and accounting errors identified by the Company at its Aerospace Systems segment. The complaint seeks monetary damages, pre- and post-judgment interest, equitable relief and fees and expenses on behalf of the Company. The
Company believes the suit lacks merit and intends to defend itself vigorously. The Company is unable to reasonably estimate any amount or range of loss, if any, that may be incurred in connection with this matter because the proceedings are in their
early stages.     Bashkirian Airways.  In March 2016, approximately $3.7 million was paid from the escrow account on
behalf of the remaining four plaintiffs in full satisfaction of the amounts awarded to them. The remaining escrow balance was returned to the Company s insurers.  
  HVC Alkmaar . On July 23, 2014, a notice of claim was received by our former JovyAtlas business unit. The notice
relates to losses resulting from a fire that occurred at an HVC Alkmaar bio-energy plant on July 21, 2013. The notice states that the fire resulted from the failure of an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) to provide sufficient power to act as
a back-up energy supply, alleges that JovyAtlas was the manufacturer and service provider for the UPS and claims  11 million in estimated property damages and  35 million in estimated business interruption damages. The Company
has tendered the notice of claim to its insurance carriers.

 The following table summarizes the components of net periodic benefit cost for the Company s pension and other
postretirement benefit plans.      
    Contributions.  The Company contributed cash of $49 million to its pension plans
and $4 million to its other postretirement benefit plans during the year-to-date period ended September 23, 2016. The Company expects to contribute an additional $51 million to its pension plans and $6 million to its other postretirement benefit
plans during the remainder of 2016.     20.  Stock-Based Compensation   
 On May 3, 2016, the stockholders of L-3 Holdings approved an amendment to its Amended and Restated 2008 Long Term Performance
Plan (2008 LTPP) to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance by 6.8 million shares to approximately 26.0 million shares. Each share of L-3 Holdings  common stock issued under a full value award (that is, awards other than
stock options and stock appreciation rights) granted on or after February 23, 2016 is counted as 4.26 shares for purposes of the share limit. Each share issued under full value awards granted between February 26, 2013 and February 22,
2016 is counted as 3.69 shares for purposes of the share limit.    During the year-to-date period ended September 23, 2016,
the Company granted stock-based compensation under the 2008 LTPP in the form of stock options, restricted stock units and performance units. The stock-based compensation awards granted during the year-to-date period ended September 23, 2016 are
further discussed below.

   Stock Options.  The Company granted 617,575 stock options with a
weighted average exercise price of $116.68 per option, which was equal to the closing price of L-3 Holdings  common stock on the date of grant. The options expire after 10 years from the date of grant and vest ratably over a three-year
period on the annual anniversary of the date of grant. The options granted to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are also subject to performance-based vesting conditions. The weighted average grant date fair value for the options of $15.90 per
option was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The weighted average assumptions used in the valuation model for this grant are presented in the table below.

    Restricted Stock Units.  The Company granted 394,086 restricted stock units with a
weighted average grant date fair value of $116.72 per share. Restricted stock units typically vest three years after the grant date for employees and one year after the grant date for non-employee directors, or if earlier, on the date of the first
annual stockholders meeting held after the grant date. The restricted stock units automatically convert into shares of L-3 Holdings  common stock upon vesting.  
  Performance Units.  The Company granted 51,892 performance units with a weighted average grant date fair value per unit
of $116.20. The final payout for these units is based on the achievement of pre-determined EPS goals established by the compensation committee of the Company s Board of Directors for the three-year period ending December 31, 2018. Units
earned under the award can range from zero to 200% of the original number of units awarded, which are converted into shares of L-3 Holdings  common stock.  
  Award Modifications . As disclosed in Note 5, the Company completed the sale of NSS on February 1, 2016. In
connection with the divestiture of NSS, the Company modified unvested restricted stock unit and stock option awards held by approximately 300 NSS employees by converting each award into a right to receive a cash payment. The cash payment was based
on the original number of units awarded, the closing price of L-3 s common stock on the closing date of the sale, and the portion of the three-year vesting period for the award that had been satisfied through the closing date, and additionally
in the case of stock options, the exercise price of the options. As a result of the award modification, the Company reversed $4 million of previously recorded stock compensation expense relating to the original awards as a reduction to shareholders
equity and recorded $5 million of expense based on the cash payments made to NSS employees in connection with the modified awards, each of which is included in the Company s results from discontinued operations.

 The Company has three reportable segments, which are described in Note 1. The Company evaluates the performance of its
operating segments and reportable segments based on their sales, operating income and operating margin. Corporate expenses are allocated to the Company s operating segments using an allocation methodology prescribed by U.S. Government
regulations for government contractors. Accordingly, segment results include all costs and expenses, except for goodwill impairment charges, gains or losses related to business divestitures, and certain other items that are excluded by management
for purposes of evaluating the operating performance of the Company s business segments. Certain corporate expenses of $4 million and $11 million for the quarterly and year-to-date periods ended September 25, 2015, respectively, that had
previously been allocated to the NSS business were retained by the Company and were allocated to L-3 s three reportable segments.

    23.  Employee Severance and Termination Costs   
 Consistent with the Company s strategy to continuously improve its cost structure and right-size its businesses,
especially in view of U.S. defense budget constraints, L-3 is completing employment reduction actions across several of its businesses to reduce both direct and indirect costs, including overhead and general and administrative costs. As a result of
these initiatives and due to the impact of U.S. defense budget constraints at certain affected business units, the Company recorded a total of $5 million and $11 million of employee severance and other termination costs, with respect to
approximately 600 employees, during the quarterly and year-to-date periods ended September 23, 2016, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a total of $18 million of employee severance and other termination costs
with respect to approximately 800 employees. Employee severance and other termination costs are reported within cost of sales on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. The remaining balance to be paid in connection with these
initiatives was $8 million at September 23, 2016 and $9 million at December 31, 2015, which is expected to be paid primarily by the second quarter of 2017. Employee severance and other termination costs incurred by reportable segment are
presented in the table below.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL   
  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   
  Overview and Outlook      L-3 s Business   
 L-3 Holdings derives all of its operating income and cash flows from its wholly-owned subsidiary, L-3 Communications. L-3
Communications is a prime contractor in Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems, aircraft sustainment (including modifications, logistics and maintenance), simulation and training, night vision and image intensification equipment
and security and detection systems. L-3 is also a leading provider of a broad range of communication and electronic systems and products used on military and commercial platforms. Our customers include the United States (U.S.) Department of Defense
(DoD) and its prime contractors, U.S. Government intelligence agencies, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), foreign governments, and domestic and international commercial customers.  
 On December 7, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our National Security Solutions (NSS) business to
CACI International Inc. The transaction was completed on February 1, 2016. NSS provided cybersecurity solutions, high-performance computing, enterprise IT services, analytics and intelligence analysis to the DoD, U.S. Government intelligence
agencies, federal civilian agencies and foreign governments. In accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-08,  Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity,  the assets and liabilities
and results of operations of NSS are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Accordingly, all references made to financial data in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are to L-3 s continuing operations, unless specifically
noted.    We have the following three reportable segments: (1) Electronic Systems, (2) Aerospace Systems and
(3) Communication Systems. Electronic Systems provides a broad range of components, products, subsystems, systems, and related services for military and commercial customers in several niche markets across several business areas. These business
areas include precision engagement   training, sensor systems, power   propulsion systems, aviation products   security systems, warrior systems and advanced programs. Aerospace Systems delivers integrated solutions for
the global ISR market and provides modernization, upgrade, sustainment, and maintenance and logistics support for a wide variety of aircraft and ground systems. Communication Systems delivers products and services for the global communications
market, specializing in strategic and tactical airborne, space, ground and sea-based communication systems.    Financial
information with respect to our segments is included in Results of Operations within this section, Note 22 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and Note 21 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.    For the year ended December 31, 2015, we
generated sales of $10,466 million and our primary end customer was the DoD. The table below presents a summary of our consolidated 2015 sales by major category of end customer and the percent contributed by each to our consolidated 2015 sales.

Table of Contents  

  We currently expect the composition of our 2016 consolidated sales to the U.S.
Government and to international and commercial customers to remain approximately the same as compared to 2015.     Business Environment   
  U.S. Government Markets.  Sales to U.S. Government customers represented 70% of our 2015 sales, and were primarily to DoD
customers, which comprised 67% of our consolidated sales. Therefore, our annual sales are generally highly correlated to changes in U.S. Government spending levels, especially DoD budget levels.  
 The total DoD budget for FY 2015 was $560 billion, a decline of 4% as compared to the FY 2014 budget due to a decrease in the
Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) budget. The FY 2015 base budget remained substantially unchanged from FY 2014 at $497 billion, while the OCO budget decreased by $22 billion. The total DoD budget for FY 2016 is $581 billion, an increase of
4% compared to FY 2015. The increase is due to a base budget of $522 billion, higher by $25 billion compared to FY 2015. The FY 2016 OCO budget declined slightly to $59 billion compared to $63 billion for FY 2015.  
 On November 2, 2015, the President signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA), which suspended the debt ceiling
through March 15, 2017 and raised spending caps previously enacted by Congress under the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA). The spending caps on defense programs were raised by $25 billion to $548 billion for FY 2016 and by $15 billion to $551
billion for FY 2017. The BBA also sets a target for OCO funding for the DoD at $59 billion for each of FY 2016 and FY 2017, subject to the Congressional appropriation process. The BBA, however, does not change the BCA budget sequestration cuts after
FY 2017.    On December 18, 2015, the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, which funded the
U.S. Government through September 30, 2016. On February 9, 2016, the Obama Administration submitted its FY 2017 DoD Proposed Budget Request (PBR). The total FY 2017 DoD budget request is $583 billion ($524 billion base budget,
$59 billion OCO), which is substantially unchanged compared to the appropriated FY 2016 DoD budget. The FY 2017 PBR complies with the BBA. However, the FY 2017 DoD budget was not approved or appropriated by Congress before October 1, 2016 and
FY 2017 began with a Continuing Resolution (CR) to fund the government through December 9, 2016. The CR will maintain funding at the current FY 2016 appropriated level resulting in a prohibition on new program starts and multi-year contract awards.
   While the BBA provides a level of stability, future DoD budgets and spending levels are determined by a number of factors
beyond our control, including changes to U.S. procurement policies, current and future domestic and international budget conditions, presidential administration priorities and changing national security and defense requirements. Furthermore, the
U.S. Government s overall fiscal challenges remain and we expect members of Congress and the Obama Administration to continue to discuss various options throughout the budget appropriations process for FY 2017, and we cannot predict the outcome
of these efforts. We believe that L-3 will benefit from several of the DoD s focus areas such as ISR, unmanned systems, undersea warfare, precision strike, secure communications, missile defense and space programs, electronic warfare, aircraft
readiness and the ability to project power in denied environments. Uncertainties continue to exist regarding how sequestration cuts, which are scheduled to resume in FY 2018, will be implemented in DoD budgets and how they will affect L-3 s DoD
business. (For more information on the risks and uncertainties related to our U.S. Government contracts, see  Part I   Item 1A   Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015).
    International and Commercial Markets   
 Sales to end customers other than the U.S. Government represented 30% of our 2015 sales, including 2% of our consolidated sales
related to Marine Systems International (MSI), which we divested on May 29, 2015. These sales are generally affected by international government security and military priorities, as well as the fiscal situations of our international government
end customers, global economic conditions for our commercial end markets and our competitive success in winning new business and increasing market share.

   Key Performance Measures   
 The primary financial performance measures that we use to manage our businesses and monitor results of operations are
(i) sales, (ii) operating income, and (iii) net cash from operating activities (Operating Cash Flow). Management believes that these financial performance measures are the primary growth drivers for our earnings per share and cash
flow generation. Generally, in evaluating our businesses and contract performance, we focus on net sales, operating income, operating margin, which we define as operating income as a percentage of sales, and Operating Cash Flow, and not the type or
amount of operating costs.    One of our primary business objectives is to increase sales organically and through select
business acquisitions. We define organic sales growth as the increase or decrease in sales for the current period compared to the prior period, excluding sales in the: (1) current period from business acquisitions that are included in our
actual results of operations for less than twelve months and (2) prior period from business divestitures that are included in our actual results of operations for the twelve-month period prior to the divestiture date. We expect to continue to
supplement, strengthen and enhance our existing businesses by selectively acquiring businesses that: (1) add important new technologies and products, (2) provide access to select customers, programs and contracts and (3) provide
attractive returns on investment. Another important financial performance measure that we use is operating margin, because sales growth combined with operating margin levels determine our operating income levels. Operating Cash Flow is also an
important financial performance measure because Operating Cash Flow measures our ability to convert operating income into cash after paying income taxes and interest expenses and investing in working capital.  
  Sales Trend.  For the quarter ended September 23, 2016 (2016 Third Quarter), consolidated net sales of $2,505
million decreased by $59 million, or 2%, compared to the quarter ended September 25, 2015 (2015 Third Quarter). Organic sales decreased by $65 million, or 2.5%, for the 2016 Third Quarter. Organic sales exclude $2 million of sales declines
related to business divestitures and $8 million of sales increases related to business acquisitions.    For the year-to-date
period ended September 23, 2016 (2016 Year-to-Date Period), consolidated net sales of $7,522 million decreased by $73 million, or 1%, compared to the year-to-date period ended September 25, 2015 (2015 Year-to-Date Period). Organic sales increased by
$70 million, or 1%, for the 2016 Year-to-Date Period. Organic sales exclude $206 million of sales declines related to business divestitures and $63 million of sales increases related to business acquisitions. See  Results of Operations, 
including segment results below for a further discussion of sales.    For the year ended December 31, 2015, our largest
contract (revenue arrangement) in terms of annual sales was the Fort Rucker Maintenance Support contract with the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Life Cycle Management Command (AMCOM), which is included in our Aerospace Systems segment. Under
this contract, which generated approximately 5% of our sales in the 2016 Year-to-Date Period and 4% of our sales in 2015, we provide maintenance, logistics and other related sustainment support services for rotary wing aircraft assigned to
Fort Rucker and satellite units in Alabama. Our period of performance, including unexercised annual options, continues through September 30, 2017. We expect the U.S. Army to re-compete this contract over the next year.  
 We derived approximately 67% of our 2015 sales from DoD customers and, as a result, our sales are highly correlated to DoD
budget levels. DoD budgets are a function of several factors and uncertainties beyond our control, including, but not limited to, changes in U.S. procurement policies, budget considerations, current and future economic conditions, presidential
administration priorities, U.S. military engagements, changing national security and defense requirements, geo-political developments, actual fiscal year congressional appropriations for defense budgets, and sequestration and other DoD budget
reductions. Any of these factors could result in a significant increase, decrease or redirection of DoD budgets and impact L-3 s future results of operations, including our sales and operating income growth rates. Additionally, L-3 s
future results of operations will be affected by our ability to retain our existing business, including our revenue arrangements with DoD customers,  
      42

and to successfully re-compete for existing business and compete for new business, which largely depends on: (1) our successful performance on existing contracts, (2) the effectiveness
and innovation of our technologies and research and development activities, (3) our ability to offer better program performance than our competitors at an affordable cost and (4) our ability to retain our employees and hire new ones,
particularly those employees who have U.S. Government security clearances. We expect our 2016 consolidated sales to decline by approximately 2% compared to 2015, including an organic sales decline of 0.3%. We expect organic international sales
to decline by approximately 12% due to the completion of certain contracts with foreign governments, and organic sales to the DoD and U.S. Government to increase by approximately 3%. We expect organic commercial sales to decline by approximately 1%
primarily for commercial aviation products. See  Other Events  for information related to the MSI divestiture, which contributed approximately 2% of our consolidated sales in 2015.  
  Operating Income Trend.  For the 2016 Third Quarter, our consolidated and segment operating income was $215 million
and our consolidated operating margin was 8.6%. Our consolidated operating income and consolidated operating margin for the 2015 Third Quarter were impacted by a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $35 million and pre-tax losses of $9 million
related to business divestitures, which are further discussed below. The pre-tax goodwill impairment charge and pre-tax losses related to business divestitures are excluded from segment operating income because they are excluded by management for
purposes of evaluating the operating performance of our business segments. Our segment operating income decreased 22% compared to $275 million for the 2015 Third Quarter, and our segment operating income as a percentage of sales (segment
operating margin) was 8.6% for the 2016 Third Quarter, a decrease of 210 basis points from 10.7% for the 2015 Third Quarter.  
 For the 2016 Year-to-Date Period, our consolidated and segment operating income was $714 million and our consolidated
operating margin was 9.5%. Our consolidated operating income and consolidated operating margin for the 2015 Year-to-Date Period were reduced by a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $35 million and pre-tax losses of $29 million related to business
divestitures. Our segment operating income increased 12% compared to $635 million for the 2015 Year-to-Date Period, and our segment operating margin was 9.5% for the 2016 Year-to-Date Period, an increase of 110 basis points from 8.4% for
the 2015 Year-to-Date Period. See  Results of Operations , including segment results below for a further discussion of operating margin.  
 Our effective management of labor, material, subcontractor and other direct costs is an important element of cost control and
favorable contract performance. We believe that proactively re-sizing our businesses to their anticipated sales, combined with continuous cost improvement will enable us to increase our cost competitiveness. While we continue to undertake cost
management actions, such as reducing our indirect costs, resizing select business units, and improving our productivity and contract performance in an effort to maintain or even increase operating margin, these efforts may not be successful and may
be partially or fully offset by other cost increases. Although we expect our 2016 annual consolidated and segment operating margin to increase as compared to 2015, changes in the competitive environment and DoD procurement practices, lower
consolidated sales and changes in annual pension expense, including related assumptions such as the benefit obligation discount rates, among other factors, could result in lower operating margin. Furthermore, select business acquisitions and new
business, including contract renewals and new contracts, could have lower future operating margins compared to L-3 s operating margins on existing contracts, and could reduce future consolidated and segment operating margins.  
  Operating Cash Flow Trend.  Operating Cash Flow of $579 million for the 2016 Year-to-Date Period decreased by $18
million compared to $597 million for the 2015 Year-to-Date Period. The decrease of Operating Cash Flow was due to higher uses of cash for working capital in the 2016 Year-to-Date Period compared to the 2015 Year-to-Date Period, primarily related to
liquidations of advanced payments and billings in excess of costs incurred, partially offset by higher net income adjusted for non-cash expenses.

   Business Divestitures   
  Discontinued Operations.  On February 1, 2016, we completed the sale of our NSS business to CACI International Inc.
for a sales price of $547 million. The sales price was finalized as of September 23, 2016, with no significant changes to preliminary amounts.  
 The table below presents statement of operations data for NSS, which was previously a reportable segment, and has been
classified as discontinued operations and includes allocated interest expense for debt not directly attributable or related to L-3 s other operations. Interest expense was allocated in accordance with the accounting standards for discontinued
operations and was based on the ratio of NSS s net assets to the sum of: (1) total L-3 consolidated net assets and (2) L-3 consolidated total debt. See Note 5 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional
information.      

(1)    
     The 2016 Year-to-Date Period includes a gain of $64
million (before and after income taxes) on the sale of the NSS business.        MSI Divestiture.  On
May 29, 2015, we completed the sale of our MSI business to W rtsil  Corporation for a sales price of  295 million (approximately $318 million), in addition to the assumption by W rtsil  Corporation of approximately
 60 million of MSI employee pension-related liabilities. The sales price was finalized as of June 24, 2016, with no significant changes to preliminary amounts. MSI was a sector within our Electronic Systems segment, primarily selling to
the commercial shipbuilding industry. We recorded a pre-tax loss of $17 million ($6 million after income taxes) for the 2015 Year-to-Date Period, related to the divestiture of MSI.  
  Broadcast Sports Inc. (BSI) Divestiture.  On April 24, 2015, we divested our BSI business for a sales price of $26
million. BSI provided wireless technology and communications systems services for use in the field of sports television broadcasting, and was included in the Sensor Systems sector of the Electronic Systems segment. We recorded a pre-tax loss of $1
million (less than $1 million after income taxes) and $4 million ($6 million after income taxes) for the 2015 Third Quarter and 2015 Year-to-Date Period, respectively, related to the divestiture of BSI.  
  Tinsley Product Line Divestiture.  On July 27, 2015, we divested our Tinsley Product Line for a sales price of $4
million. Tinsley provided optical components, sub-assemblies and passive sub-systems and was included in the Sensor Systems sector of the Electronic Systems segment. The divestiture resulted in a pre-tax loss of $8 million ($6 million after income
taxes) during the 2015 Third Quarter and 2015 Year-to-Date Period.     Business Acquisitions   
 Our Annual Report on Form 10-K summarizes the business acquisitions that we completed during the three years ended
December 31, 2015. During the 2016 Year-to-Date Period, we acquired the assets of Advanced  
      44  

Table of Contents  

Technical Materials, Inc. (ATM), with $27 million of cash on hand. Business acquisitions are included in our consolidated results of operations from their dates of acquisition. See Note 5 to our
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this quarterly report for a further discussion of our business acquisitions during the 2016 Year-to-Date Period.  
  Results of Operations   
 The following information should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
contained in this quarterly report. Our results of operations for the periods presented are affected by our business acquisitions and divestitures.  
  Consolidated Results of Operations   
 The table below provides L-3 s selected financial data, excluding discontinued operations, for the 2016 Third Quarter
compared with the 2015 Third Quarter and the 2016 Year-to-Date Period compared to the 2015 Year-to-Date Period.      
    Net Sales:  For the 2016 Third Quarter, consolidated net sales of $2,505 million
decreased $59 million, or 2%, compared to the 2015 Third Quarter. Organic sales decreased by 2.5%, or $65 million, for the 2016  
      45  

Table of Contents  

Third Quarter. Organic sales exclude $2 million of sales declines related to business divestitures and $8 million of sales increases related to business acquisitions. For the 2016
Third Quarter, organic sales to the U.S. Government increased $84 million, or 5%, and organic sales to international and commercial customers decreased $149 million, or 19%.  
 Sales from products decreased by $100 million to $1,500 million for the 2016 Third Quarter, compared to $1,600 million
for the 2015 Third Quarter. Sales from products represented approximately 60% of consolidated net sales for the 2016 Third Quarter, compared to 62% for the 2015 Third Quarter. Sales from products decreased by: (1) $45 million
primarily for ISR aircraft systems for foreign military customers as contracts near completion, (2) $28 million for Aviation Products and Security due to lower cargo sales and the timing of deliveries on airport security screening systems for
international customers and (3) $27 million for Space   Power Systems primarily due to reduced demand for power devices for commercial satellites.  
 Sales from services increased by $41 million to $1,005 million for the 2016 Third Quarter, compared to $964 million for
the 2015 Third Quarter. Sales from services represented approximately 40% of consolidated net sales for the 2016 Third Quarter, compared to 38% for the 2015 Third Quarter. Sales from services increased by: (1) $22 million for
Broadband Communication Systems due to increased volume for logistics support services for the DoD, (2) $12 million for Vertex Aerospace due to higher volume for U.S. Navy training aircraft and the U.S. Army C-12 contract and (3) $7 million
primarily due to the CTC Aviation Group (L-3 CTC) and ForceX business acquisitions.    For the 2016 Year-to-Date Period,
consolidated net sales of $7,522 million decreased $73 million, or 1%, compared to the 2015 Year-to-Date Period. Organic sales increased by $70 million, or 1%, for the 2016 Year-to-Date Period. Organic sales exclude $206 million of sales declines
related to business divestitures and $63 million of sales increases related to business acquisitions. For the 2016 Year-to-Date Period, organic sales to the U.S. Government increased $250 million, or 5%, and organic sales to international and
commercial customers decreased $180 million, or 8%.    Sales from products decreased by $167 million to $4,561 million for
the 2016 Year-to-Date Period, compared to $4,728 million for the 2015 Year-to-Date Period. Sales from products represented approximately 61% of consolidated net sales for the 2016 Year-to-Date Period, compared to 62% for the 2015 Year-to-Date
Period. Sales from products decreased by: (1) $156 million primarily related to the divestiture of MSI on May 29, 2015, (2) $67 million for Space   Power Systems primarily due to reduced demand for power devices for commercial
satellites and (3) $11 million primarily for Precision Engagement   Training due to lower volume of: (i) ordnance products for the U.S. military and (ii) civil aviation simulation and training devices for commercial customers as contracts near
completion. These decreases were partially offset by increases of: (1) $42 million for Aircraft Systems primarily due to unfavorable contract performance adjustments in the 2015 Year-to-Date Period that did not recur in the 2016 Year-to-Date Period
on international head-of-state aircraft modification contracts and (2) $25 million primarily for Broadband Communication Systems due to increased volume and deliveries of secure networked communication systems for the DoD.  
 Sales from services increased by $94 million to $2,961 million for the 2016 Year-to-Date Period, compared to $2,867 million
for the 2015 Year-to-Date Period. Sales from services represented approximately 39% of consolidated net sales for the 2016 Year-to-Date Period, compared to 38% for the 2015 Year-to-Date Period. Sales from services increased due to trends similar to
the 2016 Third Quarter. See the reportable segment results below for additional discussion of our segment sales trends.  
  Operating income and operating margin:  Segment operating income for the 2016 Third Quarter decreased by $60
million, or 22%, compared to the 2015 Third Quarter. Segment operating margin decreased by 210 basis  
      46

points to 8.6% for the 2016 Third Quarter, compared to 10.7% for the 2015 Third Quarter. Segment operating margins were lower in all three segments. The 2016 Third Quarter included
a $14 million pre-tax charge in the Electronic Systems segment for a settlement in principle of the class action litigation, which is subject to court approval, in connection with the EoTech holographic weapons sight (HWS). Pension expense declined
by $15 million compared to the 2015 Third Quarter.   Segment operating income for the 2016 Year-to-Date Period increased by
$79 million, or 12%, compared to the 2015 Year-to-Date Period. Segment operating margin increased by 110 basis points to 9.5% for the 2016 Year-to-Date Period, compared to 8.4% for the 2015 Year-to-Date Period. Segment operating margin increased by:
(1) 100 basis points primarily due to unfavorable contract performance adjustments related to cost growth in 2015 that did not recur in 2016 at Aerospace Systems on international head-of-state aircraft modification contracts and (2) 50 basis points
due to lower pension expense of $36 million. These increases were partially offset by charges in the Electronic Systems segment for a settlement in principle of the class action litigation, which is subject to court approval, in connection with the
EoTech HWS and increases to the HWS product returns allowance, which, together, decreased operating margin by 40 basis points. See the reportable segment results below for additional discussion of our operating margin trends.  
  Interest expense and other:  Interest expense and other for the 2016 Third Quarter declined by $5 million,
primarily due to lower outstanding debt as a result of the redemption of: (1) $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.95% Senior Notes due November 15, 2016 in the second quarter of 2016 and (2) $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.95%
Senior Notes due May 28, 2024 in the fourth quarter of 2015.    Interest expense and other for the 2016 Year-to-Date Period
includes a $5 million debt retirement charge related to the redemption of $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.95% Senior Notes due November 15, 2016.  
  Effective income tax rate:  The effective tax rate for the 2016 Third Quarter decreased to 16.1% from 33.0% for the
same period last year. The 2016 Third Quarter includes: (1) tax benefits of $17 million for the reversal of previously accrued amounts related to various U.S. Federal, foreign and state tax matters, (2) a benefit from the reinstatement of the
Federal Research and Experimentation (R E) tax credit and (3) $4 million due to the early adoption of a new accounting standard related to income tax benefits from employee stock-based compensation awards.  
 The effective tax rate for the 2016 Year-to-Date Period decreased to 21.7% from 22.9% for the same period last year. The 2016
Year-to-Date Period includes: (1) a benefit from the reinstatement of the Federal R E tax credit, (2) tax benefits of $21 million for the reversal of previously accrued amounts related to various U.S. Federal, foreign and state tax matters and
(3) $16 million due to the early adoption of a new accounting standard related to income tax benefits from employee stock-based compensation awards.  
  Diluted EPS from continuing operations:  Diluted EPS from continuing operations decreased 7% to $1.88 compared to
adjusted diluted EPS of $2.03 for the 2015 Third Quarter. The 2015 Third Quarter adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations excludes after tax losses of: (1) $34 million, or $0.42 per share, related to goodwill impairment charges and
(2) $6 million, or $0.07 per share, related to business divestitures.    Diluted EPS from continuing operations increased
22% to $5.83 compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $4.76 for the 2015 Year-to-Date Period. The 2015 Year-to-Date Period adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations excludes after tax losses of: (1) $34 million, or $0.40 per share, related to
goodwill impairment charges and (2) $18 million, or $0.22 per share, related to business divestitures.

(3)     Adjusted diluted EPS is
diluted EPS attributable to L-3 Holdings  common stockholders, excluding the charges or credits relating to business divestitures and non-cash goodwill impairment charges. Adjusted net income attributable to L-3 is net income attributable to
L-3, excluding the charges or credits relating to business divestitures and non-cash goodwill impairment charges. These amounts are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.
GAAP). We believe that the charges or credits relating to business divestitures and non-cash goodwill impairment charges affect the comparability of the results of operations of 2015 to the results of operations for 2016. We also believe that
disclosing net income and diluted EPS excluding the charges or credits relating to business divestitures and non-cash goodwill impairment charges will allow investors to more easily compare the 2016 results to the 2015 results. However, these
measures may not be defined or calculated by other companies in the same manner.  

(4)     Amounts may not calculate
directly due to rounding.  
          
    Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding:  Diluted weighted average common
shares outstanding for the 2016 Third Quarter and 2016 Year-to-Date Period declined by 3% and 5%, respectively, compared to the same periods last year, primarily due to repurchases of L-3 common stock in connection with our share repurchase
program authorized by our Board of Directors.

    Reportable Segment Results of Operations    
 The table below presents selected data by reportable segment reconciled to consolidated totals. The results of operations of
the NSS business sold to CACI International Inc. are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Accordingly, the NSS business is no longer a reportable segment. See Note 22 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements contained in this quarterly report for additional reportable segment data.      

(1)   
   Net sales after intercompany eliminations.     
  Electronic Systems       
   Electronic Systems net sales for the 2016 Third Quarter decreased by $2 million compared
to the 2015 Third Quarter. Organic sales decreased by $5 million, or 0.5%, compared to the 2015 Third Quarter. Organic sales exclude $2 million of sales declines related to business divestitures and $5 million of sales increases related to
business acquisitions. Sales decreased by $28 million for Aviation Products and Security due to lower  
      49  

Table of Contents  

cargo sales and the timing of deliveries on airport security screening systems for international customers, partially offset by $23 million primarily for Sensor Systems due to increased
deliveries of airborne EO/IR turrets to foreign militaries.    Electronic Systems operating income for the 2016
Third Quarter decreased by $2 million, or 2%, compared to the 2015 Third Quarter. Operating margin decreased by 20 basis points to 12.0%. A $14 million pre-tax charge for a settlement in principle of the class action litigation, which is
subject to court approval, in connection with the EoTech HWS lowered operating margin by 140 basis points. Sales mix changes, primarily for Warrior Systems, lowered operating margin 80 basis points. These decreases were partially offset by 150 basis
points for improved contract performance and 50 basis points due to lower pension expense of $5 million.    Electronic
Systems net sales for the 2016 Year-to-Date Period decreased by $165 million, or 5%, compared to the 2015 Year-to-Date Period. Organic sales decreased by $10 million, or 0.3%, compared to the 2015 Year-to-Date Period. Organic sales exclude $206
million of sales declines related to business divestitures (primarily MSI in May 2015) and $51 million of sales increases related to business acquisitions. The decrease was driven by $16 million for Warrior Systems related to an increase in the
products returns allowance for EoTech HWS products and $13 million for Precision Engagement   Training due to lower volume of: (i) ordnance products for the U.S. military and (ii) civil aviation simulation and training devices for commercial
customers as contracts near completion. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $19 million primarily for Sensor Systems due to increased deliveries of airborne EO/IR turrets and electronic warfare products to foreign militaries.
   Electronic Systems operating income for the 2016 Year-to-Date Period decreased by $13 million, or 4%, compared to the
2015 Year-to-Date Period. Operating margin increased by 20 basis points to 11.7%. Operating margin increased by: (1) 70 basis points due to higher margins related to acquisitions and divestitures, (2) 40 basis points due to lower pension expense of
$11 million, and (3) 10 basis points primarily due to higher net aggregate favorable contract performance adjustments in the 2016 Year-To-Date Period compared to the 2015 Year-To-Date Period. These increases were offset by a decrease of 100 basis
points due to $30 million of pre-tax charges for a settlement in principle of the class action litigation, which is subject to court approval, in connection with the EoTech HWS and increases to the HWS product returns allowance.  
  Aerospace Systems       
   Aerospace Systems net sales for the 2016 Third Quarter decreased by $54 million, or 5%,
compared to the 2015 Third Quarter. Sales decreased $64 million for ISR Systems and $2 million for Aircraft Systems, partially offset by a $12 million increase for Vertex Aerospace. Sales decreased for ISR Systems by: (1) $46 million for small
ISR aircraft fleet management services to the U.S. Air Force due to reduced demand resulting from the U.S. military drawdown in Afghanistan and (2) $42 million for ISR aircraft systems for foreign military customers as contracts near completion.
These decreases were partially offset by higher volume of $12 million for large ISR aircraft systems for the U.S. Government and $12 million for small ISR aircraft systems for the U.S. Army. Sales increased for Vertex Aerospace due to higher volume
for U.S. Navy training aircraft and the U.S. Army C-12 contract.  
      50  

Table of Contents  

  Aerospace Systems operating income for the 2016 Third Quarter decreased by
$46 million, compared to the 2015 Third Quarter. Operating margin decreased by 410 basis points to 5.5%. Operating margin decreased by: (1) 200 basis points primarily due to lower favorable contract performance adjustments in the 2016
Third Quarter compared to the 2015 Third Quarter for ISR Systems primarily on contracts that are nearing completion, (2) 100 basis points due to lower sales and changes in sales mix for ISR Systems, (3) 90 basis points due to lower
incentive fees and increases in lower margin task orders on the Fort Rucker Maintenance Support contract and (4) 80 basis points due to an $8 million contract price adjustment in the 2015 Third Quarter for a recovery of cost overruns on the
previous U.S. Army C-12 contract that did not recur in the 2016 Third Quarter. These decreases were partially offset by 60 basis points due to lower pension expense of $6 million.  
 Aerospace Systems net sales for the 2016 Year-to-Date Period increased by $78 million, or 3%, compared to the 2015
Year-to-Date Period. Sales increased $62 million for Aircraft Systems and $35 million for Vertex Aerospace, partially offset by a $19 million decrease for ISR Systems. Sales increased for Aircraft Systems primarily due to unfavorable contract
performance adjustments in the 2015 Year-to-Date Period that did not recur in the 2016 Year-to-Date Period on international head-of-state aircraft modification contracts. Sales increased for Vertex Aerospace due to higher volume and pre-production
activities for U.S. Navy training aircraft and the U.S. Army C-12 contract. Sales decreases for ISR Systems were due to trends similar to the 2016 Third Quarter, partially offset by an increase in sales due to the procurement and delivery of
two business jets to a foreign military customer in the second quarter of 2016.    Aerospace Systems operating income for
the 2016 Year-to-Date Period increased by $88 million, or 61%, compared to the 2015 Year-to-Date Period. Operating margin increased by 260 basis points to 7.3%. Operating margin increased by: (1) 210 basis points primarily due to net aggregate
unfavorable contract performance adjustments in the 2015 Year-to-Date Period, which included $101 million of cost growth on international head-of-state aircraft modification contracts, that did not recur in the 2016 Year-to-Date Period and (2) 50
basis points due to lower pension expense of $15 million.     Communication Systems   
   
   Communication Systems net sales for the 2016 Third Quarter decreased by $3 million
compared to the 2015 Third Quarter. Organic sales decreased by $6 million, or 1%, compared to the 2015 Third Quarter. Organic sales exclude $3 million of sales increases related to business acquisitions. Sales decreased by $30 million in
the Tactical Satcom sector due to fewer deliveries on a satellite communications (Satcom) land terminals contract for the Australian Defence Force (ADF), which was completed in the second quarter of 2016. In the Space   Power Systems sector,
sales declined by $22 million due to reduced demand for power devices for commercial satellites. These decreases were largely offset by increased volume and deliveries to the U.S. DoD of secure networked communication systems in the Broadband
Communication Systems sector and mobile and ground-based Satcom systems in the Tactical Satcom sector.    Communication
Systems operating income for the 2016 Third Quarter decreased by $12 million, or 23%, compared to the 2015 Third Quarter. Operating margin decreased by 240 basis points to 7.9%. The lower sales on the ADF Satcom land terminals contract and
power devices for commercial satellites reduced operating margin by 220 basis points. Increased design and production costs on new commercial ground-based power amplifier products partially offset by sales growth and favorable contract performance,
primarily in Broadband Communication Systems sector, reduced operating margin by 100 basis points. Lower pension expense of $4 million increased operating margin by 80 basis points.

  Communication Systems net sales for the 2016 Year-to-Date Period increased by $14
million, or 1%, compared to the 2015 Year-to-Date Period. Organic sales increased by $2 million, or 0.1%, compared to the 2015 Year-to-Date Period. Organic sales exclude $12 million of sales increases related to business acquisitions. The increase
was due to: (1) $62 million for Broadband Communication Systems, primarily due to increased volume and deliveries of secure networked communication systems for the DoD and (2) $7 million primarily for Advanced Communications products due to
increased deliveries of secure mission data storage systems for the Joint Strike Fighter program. These increases were largely offset by a decrease of $67 million for Space   Power Systems, primarily due to reduced demand for power devices for
commercial satellites.    Communication Systems operating income for the 2016 Year-to-Date Period increased by $4 million,
or 3%, compared to the 2015 Year-to-Date Period. Operating margin increased by 20 basis points to 9.7%. Operating margin increased by 70 basis points due to lower pension expense of $10 million, partially offset by a decrease of 50 basis points
primarily due to sales mix changes.     Liquidity and Capital Resources   
   Anticipated Sources and Uses of Cash Flow    
 At September 23, 2016, we had total cash and cash equivalents of $411 million as compared to $207 million at December
31, 2015. While no amounts of the cash and cash equivalents are considered restricted, $231 million of cash was held by the Company s foreign subsidiaries at September 23, 2016. The repatriation of cash held in non-U.S. jurisdictions is
subject to local capital requirements, as well as income tax considerations. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow generated from operations, cash on hand and our $1 billion Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility (Credit Facility),
which expires on February 3, 2017. At September 23, 2016, we had the full availability of our Credit Facility, which we expect will be renewed for a period of five years prior to its expiration. We generated $579 million of net cash from
operating activities from continuing operations during the 2016 Year-to-Date Period. Significant cash uses during the 2016 Year-to-Date Period included $298 million to partially redeem our 3.95% Senior Notes due in November 2016 (the 2016 Notes),
$326 million to repurchase shares of our common stock, $166 million related to the payment of dividends, $126 million related to capital expenditures and $27 million related to the ATM business acquisition. Additionally, L-3 received net cash
proceeds of $561 million primarily for the NSS divestiture.    We currently believe that our cash from operating activities
generated during the year, together with our cash on hand, and available borrowings under our Credit Facility, will be adequate for the foreseeable future to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, defined
benefit plan contributions, commitments, contingencies, research and development expenditures, select business acquisitions (depending on the size), program and other discretionary investments, interest payments, income tax payments, L-3
Holdings  dividends and share repurchases, the repayment of the remaining $200 million aggregate principal amount of the 2016 Notes and the repayment of $350 million aggregate principal amount of our 1.50% Senior Notes due May 2017 (if the
Notes are not refinanced).      Balance Sheet    
 Billed receivables increased by $66 million to $812 million at September 23, 2016, from $746 million at December 31,
2015 primarily due to the timing of billings and collections for Power   Propulsion Systems, Broadband Communication Systems, and Precision Engagement   Training. These increases were partially offset by decreases for Warrior Systems and ISR
Systems.    Contracts in process increased by $184 million to $2,265 million at September 23, 2016, from $2,081 million at
December 31, 2015. During the 2016 Year-to-Date Period, contracts in process increased by $193 million comprised of:      

increases of $72 million in unbilled contract receivables primarily due to sales exceeding billings for ISR
Systems   Aircraft Systems and Power and Propulsion Systems, and         

increases of $121 million in inventoried contract costs primarily due to the timing of deliveries for Warrior
Systems, Space   Power Systems, Broadband Communication Systems and Precision Engagement   Training.     
      52

  These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $9 million for foreign
currency translation adjustments.    L-3 s receivables days sales outstanding (DSO) was 74 at September 23, 2016,
compared with 70 at December 31, 2015 and 78 at September 25, 2015. We calculate our DSO by dividing: (1) our aggregate end of period billed receivables and net unbilled contract receivables, by (2) our trailing 12 month sales
adjusted, on a pro forma basis, to include sales from business acquisitions and exclude sales from business divestitures that we completed as of the end of the period and discontinued operations, multiplied by the number of calendar days in the
trailing 12 month period (364 days at September 23, 2016, 365 days at December 31, 2015 and 364 days at September 25, 2015). Our trailing 12 month pro forma sales were $10,393 million at September 23, 2016,
$10,314 million at December 31, 2015 and $10,257 million at September 25, 2015. The increase in DSO during the 2016 Year-to-Date Period was primarily due to an increase in billed and unbilled receivables, which is discussed above.  
 Inventories increased by $28 million to $361 million at September 23, 2016, from $333 million at December 31, 2015,
primarily for Aviation Products   Security and Advanced Communications to support customer demand.    The decrease in
other current assets was primarily due to lower prepaid taxes caused by the timing of income tax payments.    The decrease
in assets and liabilities of discontinued operations is due to the completion of the NSS divestiture during the 2016 Year-to-Date Period.  
 Goodwill increased by $3 million to $6,284 million at September 23, 2016 from $6,281 million at December 31, 2015. The
table below presents the changes in goodwill by segment.      

(1)  
     The net increase in goodwill for the Electronic Systems
segment was due to the final purchase price allocations for the ForceX, Inc. and CTC Aviation Group business acquisitions. The increase in goodwill for the Communication Systems segment was due to the ATM business acquisition.     

(2)   
   The decrease in goodwill presented in the Electronic Systems segment was due to the strengthening of the U.S.
dollar against the British pound, partially offset by the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar and the Euro during the 2016 Year-to-Date Period. The increase in goodwill presented in the Aerospace Systems segment was due to the
weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar during the 2016 Year-to-Date Period.       The
increase in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of when invoices for purchases from third party vendors and subcontractors were received and payments were made.  
 The decrease in advance payments and billings in excess of costs incurred was primarily due to the liquidation of balances on
contracts for Aircraft Systems, ISR Systems and Aviation Products   Security.    The increase in deferred tax
liabilities was primarily due to the tax amortization of certain goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets during the 2016 Year-to-Date Period.

   Statement of Cash Flows   
   2016 Year-to-Date Period Compared with 2015 Year-to-Date Period    
 The table below provides a summary of our cash flows from (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities for the
periods indicated.      
    Operating Activities   
 We generated $579 million of cash from operating activities during the 2016 Year-to-Date Period, a decrease of $18 million
compared to the 2015 Year-to-Date Period. The decrease of cash from operating activities is due to higher uses of cash for working capital in the 2016 Year-to-Date Period compared to the 2015 Year-to-Date Period, primarily related to liquidations of
advanced payments and billings in excess of costs incurred, partially offset by higher net income adjusted for non-cash expenses. The net cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities is further discussed above under  Liquidity and
Capital Resources   Balance Sheet .     Investing Activities   
 During the 2016 Year-to-Date Period, we generated $430 million of cash from investing activities, which included $561
million of cash received from business divestitures (primarily NSS), partially offset by cash used of $27 million for the acquisition of ATM and $126 million for capital expenditures. During the 2015 Year-to-Date Period, we used $82 million of cash,
which included $260 million for the acquisitions of L-3 CTC and MITEQ, Inc. and $137 million for capital expenditures, partially offset by $308 million of net proceeds received from the MSI, BSI and Tinsley divestitures.  
  Financing Activities       Debt    
 At September 23, 2016, total outstanding debt was $3,331 million, compared to $3,624 million at December 31, 2015, all of
which was senior debt. On March 24, 2016, we initiated a redemption of $300 million aggregate principal amount of the 2016 Notes. The redemption price was determined on May 17, 2016 at 101.475% of the principal amount thereof (Redemption
Price). Interest on the 2016 Notes redeemed ceased to accrue on and after May 20, 2016 (Redemption Date) and the only remaining right of holders of such 2016 Notes was to receive payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest. On May 20,
2016, we completed the partial redemption and recognized a debt retirement charge of $5 million. Following the partial redemption of the 2016 Notes, $200 million aggregate principal amount of the 2016 Notes remain outstanding. At September 23, 2016,
there were no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under our Credit Facility. Accordingly, we had the full availability of our $1 billion facility for future borrowings. We also had $395 million of outstanding standby letters of credit
with financial institutions covering performance and financial guarantees per contractual requirements with certain customers at September 23, 2016. These standby letters of credit may be drawn upon in the event that we do not perform on certain of
our contractual requirements. At September 23, 2016, our outstanding debt matures between November 15, 2016 and May 28, 2024. See Note 10 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this quarterly report for
the components of our debt at September 23, 2016.

  We consider our credit rating as an important element of our capital allocation
strategy and, while no assurances can be given, we intend to maintain our investment grade credit rating. On April 8, 2016, Standard and Poor s changed our rating outlook to stable from negative and affirmed our BBB- senior unsecured
rating.     Debt Covenants and Other Provisions.  The Credit Facility and Senior Notes contain financial and/or
other restrictive covenants. See Note 9 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a description of our debt, related financial covenants and
cross default provisions. At September 23, 2016, we were in compliance with our financial and other restrictive covenants.  
  Guarantees.  The borrowings under the Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by L-3 Holdings and by
substantially all of the material 100% owned domestic subsidiaries of L-3 Communications on an unsecured senior basis. The payment of principal and premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Notes is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on an
unsecured senior basis, jointly and severally, by L-3 Communications  material 100% owned domestic subsidiaries that guarantee any of its other indebtedness. The guarantees of the Credit Facility and the Senior Notes rank pari passu with each
other.      Equity    
 Repurchases of L-3 Holdings  common stock, under the share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors, are made
from time to time at management s discretion, in accordance with applicable U.S. Federal securities laws. The timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including our financial
position, earnings, legal requirements, other investment opportunities (including acquisitions), market conditions and other factors. All share repurchases of L-3 Holdings  common stock have been recorded as treasury shares.  
 The table below presents our repurchases of L-3 Holdings  common stock during the 2016 Year-to-Date Period.  
   
   At September 23, 2016, the remaining dollar value under share repurchase programs authorized
by our Board of Directors was $480 million. From September 24, 2016 through October 21, 2016, we repurchased 112,846 shares of our common stock at an average price of $150.63 per share for an aggregate amount of $17 million.  
 During the 2016 Year-to-Date Period, our Board of Directors authorized the quarterly cash dividends in the table below.

caution investors that these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond our control that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or
projected by, the forward-looking information and statements. Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, the following: our dependence on the defense industry; backlog processing and program slips
resulting from delayed awards and/or funding from the DoD and other major customers; the U.S. Government fiscal situation; changes in DoD budget levels and spending priorities; U.S. Government failure to raise the debt ceiling; our reliance on
contracts with a limited number of customers and the possibility of termination of government contracts by unilateral government action or for failure to perform; the extensive legal and regulatory requirements surrounding many of our contracts; our
ability to retain our existing business and related contracts; our ability to successfully compete for and win new business; or, identify, acquire and integrate additional businesses; our ability to maintain and improve our operating margin; the

Aerospace Systems segment; our significant amount of debt and the restrictions contained in our debt agreements and actions taken by rating agencies that could result in a downgrade of our debt; our ability to continue to recruit, retain and train
our employees; actual future interest rates, volatility and other assumptions used in the determination of pension benefits and equity based compensation, as well as the market performance of benefit plan assets; our collective bargaining
agreements, our ability to successfully negotiate contracts with labor unions and our ability to favorably resolve labor disputes should they arise; the business, economic and political conditions in the markets in which we operate; global economic
uncertainty; the DoD s Better Buying Power and other efficiency initiatives; events beyond our control such as acts of terrorism; our ability to perform contracts on schedule; our international operations including currency risks and compliance
with foreign laws; our extensive use of fixed-price type revenue arrangements; the rapid change of technology and high level of competition in which our businesses participate; risks relating to technology and data security; our introduction of new
products into commercial markets or our investments in civil and commercial products or companies; our ability to predict the level of participation in, and the related costs of, our voluntary return program for certain EoTech holographic weapons
sight products, and our ability to change and terminate the voluntary return program at our discretion; the impact on our business of improper conduct by our employees, agents or business partners; goodwill impairments and the fair values of our
assets; and the ultimate resolution of contingent matters, claims and investigations relating to acquired businesses, and the impact on the final purchase price allocations.

  Readers of this document are cautioned that our forward-looking statements are
not guarantees of future performance and the actual results or developments may differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements.  
 As for the forward-looking statements that relate to future financial results and other projections, actual results will be
different due to the inherent uncertainties of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than projected and such differences could be material. Given these uncertainties, you should not place any reliance on these
forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements also represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim a duty to provide updates to these forward-looking statements, and the estimates
and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this filing, to reflect events or changes in circumstances or changes in expectations or the occurrence of anticipated events.

    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   
   Conclusions Regarding Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 related to L-3 Holdings and L-3 Communications is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management, with the participation of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and our Senior Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 23, 2016. Based upon that evaluation, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and our Senior Vice President
and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 23, 2016, the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level.  
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 23,
2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

2.1     Annual Meeting . An annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation for the election of directors shall be held on such date, and at such place (if any) and time, as may be fixed by resolution of the Board
of Directors. Any other proper business may be transacted at the annual meeting.    Section 2.2     Special
Meetings .    (A)    Special meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation (i) may be called by the Chairman of
the Board, if there be one, or the President, (ii) shall be called by the Chairman of the Board or the President at the request in writing of a majority of the Board of Directors, and (iii) shall be called by the Secretary upon the written request
of one or more Proposing Person(s) (as defined below) who (x) have Net Long Beneficial Ownership (as defined below) of at least twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Corporation (the  Requisite Percentage )
at the time such special meeting request is validly delivered to the Secretary (the  Delivery Date ) and (y) have had continuous Net Long Beneficial Ownership of at least the Requisite Percentage for a minimum of one full year prior to the
Delivery Date (the  Holding Requirement ), subject to and in compliance with this Section  

2.2 and, to the extent applicable to special meetings of stockholders, Section 2.8. Compliance by the Proposing Person(s) with the requirements of this Section 2.2, Section 2.8, to the
extent applicable to special meetings of stockholders, and related provisions of these Bylaws shall be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, which determination shall be binding on the Corporation and its stockholders.  
 The term  Net Long Beneficial Ownership  (and its correlative terms), when used to describe the nature of a Proposing Person s
ownership of common stock of the Corporation, shall mean those shares of common stock of the Corporation as to which the Proposing Person in question possesses: (i) the sole power to vote or direct the voting of, (ii) the sole economic incidents of
ownership (including the sole right to profits and the sole risk of loss), and (iii) the sole power to dispose of or direct the disposition of. The number of shares calculated in accordance with clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) shall not include any
shares that, directly or indirectly, underlie any  derivative security  (as such term is defined in Rule 16a-1(c) under the Exchange Act (as defined below)) that constitutes a  call equivalent position  (as such term is defined
in Rule 16a-1(b) under the Exchange Act) and that is, directly or indirectly, held or maintained by a Proposing Person with respect to any shares of any class or series of shares of the Corporation.  
  Proposing Person  shall mean the holder of record of common stock of the Corporation submitting a special meeting request and the
beneficial owner of common stock, if any, on whose behalf such request is made; provided, however, that, with respect to the informational requirements of Section 2.2(B), if the record holder of such common stock is making the Special Meeting
Request on behalf of the beneficial owner of such common stock, the term  Proposing Person  shall be deemed to refer solely to such beneficial owner.  
 (B)    In order for a special meeting to be called upon stockholder request (a  Stockholder Requested Special
Meeting ), one or more requests for a special meeting in the form required by this Section 2.2 must be signed by Proposing Person(s) holding the Requisite Percentage and be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the
Corporation by registered mail, return receipt requested. Such request(s) shall: (i) set forth a statement of the specific purpose or purposes of the meeting and the matters proposed to be acted on at such special meeting; (ii) bear the date of
signature of each such Proposing Person signing the request; (iii) set forth (a) the name and address of each Proposing Person signing such request, (b) the class and the number of shares of common stock of the Corporation which are owned of record
or beneficially by such Proposing Person, (c) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation representing such Proposing Person s Net Long Beneficial Ownership, including a description of all securities or other instruments
relating thereto, (d) documentary evidence that the Proposing Person(s) have had continuous Net Long Beneficial Ownership of the Requisite Percentage for a minimum of one full year prior to the Delivery Date, and (e) a certification that the
Proposing Person satisfies the Net Long Beneficial Ownership requirement and the Holding Requirement of these Bylaws; (iv) contain the information required by Section 2.8 of these Bylaws as if incorporated in this Section 2.2; (v) contain a
representation that the Proposing Person intends to hold the shares of common stock of the Corporation described in clause (iii) of this Section 2.2(B) through the date of the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting; and (vi) contain an
acknowledgement by such Proposing Person that any reduction in such stockholder s Net Long Beneficial Ownership with respect to which the special meeting request relates following the Delivery Date shall constitute a revocation of such request
to the extent of such  
      2  

reduction. Any Proposing Person may revoke a request for a Stockholder Requested Special Meeting at any time by written revocation delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive
offices of the Corporation. If, following any such revocation (or any deemed revocation hereunder), at any time before the date of the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting, the remaining requests are from Proposing Person(s) holding in the
aggregate less than the Requisite Percentage, the Board of Directors, in its discretion, shall cancel the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting.  
 (C)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Secretary shall not be required to call a Stockholder Requested Special Meeting
if: (i) the Board of Directors has called or calls an annual or special meeting of stockholders to be held not later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the Delivery Date at which an identical or substantially similar item (a  Similar
Item  and, for purposes of this clause (C), the removal of directors shall be deemed a  Similar Item  with respect to all items of business involving the election or removal of directors) to that included in such request will be
presented; or (ii) the special meeting request (a) is received by the Secretary during the period commencing ninety (90) days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the immediately preceding annual meeting and ending on the date of the next
annual meeting; (b) contains a Similar Item to an item that was presented at any meeting of stockholders held within one year prior to the Delivery Date; (c) relates to an item of business that is not a proper subject for action by the stockholders
of the Corporation under applicable law; (d) was made in a manner that involved a violation of Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act or other applicable law; or (e) does not comply with the provisions of this Section 2.2 or, to the extent
applicable, Section 2.8.    (D)    Any special meeting of stockholders, including any Stockholder Requested Special
Meeting, shall be held at such date, time and place, if any, as may be fixed by the Board of Directors in accordance with these Bylaws and in compliance with applicable law; provided that a Stockholder Requested Special Meeting shall be held within
one hundred twenty (120) days after the Delivery Date.    (E)    Any Proposing Person who delivered a valid special
meeting request shall further update and supplement such request, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided in such request shall be true and correct: (i) as of the record date for notice of the Stockholder Requested
Special Meeting, and (ii) as of the date that is fifteen (15) days prior to the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, and such update and supplement shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal
executive offices of the Corporation not later than five (5) days after the record date for the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting (in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of the record date), and not later than ten (10)
days prior to the date for the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting or, if practical, any adjournment or postponement thereof (and, if not practicable, on the first practicable date prior to the date to which the Stockholder Requested Special
Meeting has been adjourned or postponed) (in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of fifteen (15) days prior to the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof).  
 (F)    Business transacted at any Stockholder Requested Special Meeting shall be limited to the purpose(s) stated in the
special meeting request; provided, however, that nothing herein shall prohibit the Board of Directors from submitting matters to a vote of the stockholders at any Stockholder Requested Special Meeting.  
      3  

Section 2.3     Place of Meeting; Meetings by Remote
Communication . (A) The Board of Directors may designate the place, if any, of any meeting of the stockholders, or may direct that the meeting be held solely by means of remote communication. If the Board of Directors does not (x)
designate the place of any meeting or (y) direct that the meeting be held solely by means of remote communication, the meeting shall be held at the principal office of the Corporation.  
 (B)    If authorized by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as
the Board of Directors may adopt, stockholders and proxyholders not physically present at a meeting of stockholders may, by means of remote communication: (i) participate in a meeting of stockholders; and (ii) be deemed present in person and vote at
a meeting of stockholders whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of remote communication; provided that (a) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and
permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a stockholder or proxyholder; (b) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to provide such stockholders and proxyholders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the stockholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings; and (c) if any stockholder or proxyholder votes or takes other
action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such vote or other action shall be maintained by the Corporation.  
 Section 2.4     Notice of Meeting . Unless otherwise required by law, a notice, stating the place of the meeting
(or the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed present in person and entitled to vote at such meeting), the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting if such date
is different from the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of such meeting, the date and time of any meeting of stockholders and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall
be prepared and delivered by the Corporation not less than ten (10) days nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder of record as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of the
meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail with postage thereon prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such stockholder s address as it appears on the records of the
Corporation. If given by electronic transmission, such notice shall be deemed given at the time specified in Section 232 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Any previously scheduled meeting of the stockholders may be
postponed, canceled or rescheduled by resolution of the Board of Directors upon public notice given prior to the date previously scheduled for such meeting of stockholders.  
 Section 2.5     Quorum and Adjournment . Except as otherwise provided by law or by the Certificate of
Incorporation, the holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of stockholders, provided that where a separate vote by
a class or series (or classes or series) is required, the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of such class or  
      4  

series (or classes or series) shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter. The stockholders present at a duly organized meeting may continue to
transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum. The chairman of the meeting or a majority in voting power of the shares so represented may adjourn the meeting from time to
time, whether or not there is such a quorum. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, a notice of the
adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board of
Directors shall fix as the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and shall give
notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such adjourned meeting as of the record date so fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting.  
 Section 2.6     Voting; Proxies . Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, each
director shall be elected by the vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to that director s election at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present; provided that if, as of the tenth (10th) day preceding the
date the Corporation first transmits its notice of meeting for such meeting to the stockholders of the Corporation, or, at any time thereafter, the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected (a  Contested Election ),
the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast. For purposes of this Section 2.6, a majority of the votes cast in respect of the election of any director means that the number of votes cast  for  such
director s election must exceed the number of votes cast  against  such director s election, and an abstention or broker non-vote will not count as a vote  for  or  against  a director s
election. All other matters presented to the stockholders at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall, unless a different or minimum vote is required by the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, the rules or regulations of any stock
exchange applicable to the Corporation, or any law or regulation applicable to the Corporation or its securities, in which case such different or minimum vote shall be the applicable vote on the matter, be decided by a majority of the votes cast on
such matter. Such votes may be cast in person or by proxy but no proxy shall be voted on after three years from its date, unless such proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and
if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by delivering to the
Secretary of the Corporation a revocation of such proxy or a new proxy bearing a later date. The Board of Directors, in its discretion, or the chairman of the meeting, in his or her discretion, may require that any votes cast at such meeting
shall be cast by written ballot.    Section 2.7     Inspectors of Elections; Conduct of the Meeting .  
 (A)    The Board of Directors by resolution may appoint one or more inspectors, which inspector or inspectors may include
individuals who serve the Corporation in other capacities, including, without limitation, as officers, employees, agents or representatives of the Corporation, to act at the meeting and make a written report thereof. One or more persons may
 
      5  

be designated as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate has been appointed to act, or if all inspectors or alternates who have been
appointed are unable to act, at a meeting of stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before discharging his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to
execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspectors shall have the duties prescribed by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.  
 (B)    The chairman of the meeting shall fix and announce at the meeting the date and time of the opening and the closing
of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting. The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except
to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the chairman of the meeting shall have the right and authority to convene and (for any or no reason) to recess and/or adjourn the meeting, to prescribe
such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or
prescribed by the chairman of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of
those present; (iii) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the chairman of the meeting shall determine;
(iv) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (v) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants. In addition to making any other determinations that may be
appropriate to the conduct of the meeting, the chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a matter or business was not properly brought before the meeting and, if such chairman should make such
determination and declaration, any such matter or business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted or considered at the meeting. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the chairman of the
meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure.    Section
2.8     Notice of Stockholder Business and Nominations .    (A)     Annual
Meetings . (1) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors and the proposal of other business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders only (a) pursuant to the Corporation s
notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) delivered pursuant to Section 2.4 of these Bylaws, (b) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof, (c) by any stockholder of the Corporation who is entitled to vote on such
election or such other business at the meeting, who complied with the notice procedures set forth in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph (A) of this Bylaw and who was a stockholder of record at the time such notice is delivered to the
Secretary of the Corporation or (d) in the case of stockholder nominations to be included in the Corporation s proxy statement for an annual meeting of stockholders, by a Nominator or Nominator Group (each, as defined below) who satisfies the
notice, ownership and other requirements of Section 2.9 of these Bylaws.  
      6  

(2)    For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an

meeting and proxy materials, as applicable, for any annual meeting of stockholders (a) the name of any person nominated for election (the  Stockholder Nominee ) by a stockholder who (i) is a stockholder of record of the Corporation as of
the date that the Notice of Proxy Access Nomination (as defined below) is received by the Corporation in accordance with this Section 2.9, (ii) is entitled to vote for the election of directors at the annual meeting and (iii) satisfies the notice,
ownership and other requirements of this Section 2.9 (such stockholder, together with the beneficial owner of such shares, a  Nominator ) or by a group of no more than 20 such stockholders (such stockholders, together with the beneficial
owners of such shares, a  Nominator Group ) that, collectively as a Nominator Group, satisfies the notice, ownership and other requirements of this Section 2.9 applicable to a Nominator Group; provided that, in the case of a Nominator
Group, each member thereof (each a  Group Member ) shall have satisfied the notice, ownership and other requirements of this Section 2.9 applicable to Group Members, and (b) subject to paragraph (I) of this Section 2.9, if the Nominator or
the Nominator Group, as applicable, so elects, the Nomination Statement (as defined below) furnished by such Nominator or Nominator Group; and (2) include such Stockholder Nominee s name on any ballot distributed at such annual meeting and on
the Corporation s proxy card (or any other format through which the Corporation permits proxies to be submitted) distributed in connection with such annual meeting. Nothing in this Section 2.9 shall limit the Corporation s ability to
solicit against, and include in its proxy materials its own statements relating to, any Stockholder Nominee, Nominator or Nominator Group, or to include such Stockholder Nominee as a nominee of the Board.  
 (B)     Maximum Number of Stockholder Nominees.  At each annual meeting of stockholders, a Nominator or
Nominator Group may nominate one or more Stockholder Nominees for election at such meeting pursuant to this Section 2.9; provided that the maximum number of Stockholder Nominees nominated by all Nominators and Nominator Groups (including Stockholder
Nominees that were submitted by a Nominator or Nominator Group for inclusion in the Corporation s proxy materials pursuant to this Section 2.9 but either are subsequently withdrawn, disregarded, declared invalid or ineligible pursuant to this
Section 2.9 or that the Board of Directors determines to nominate as Board of Directors nominees) appearing in the Corporation s proxy materials with respect to an annual meeting of stockholders shall not exceed 20% of the total number of
independent directors in office as of the Final Proxy Access Deadline (as defined below), or if such number is not a whole number, the closest whole number below 20% (the  Maximum Number ). The Maximum Number shall be reduced, but not
below zero, by the sum of (x) the number of persons that the Board of Directors decides to nominate  
      10  

pursuant to an agreement, arrangement or other understanding with one or more stockholders of record or beneficial owners, as the case may be, in lieu of such person being formally nominated as a
director pursuant to this Section 2.9; and (y) the number of persons that the Board of Directors decides to nominate for re-election who were previously elected to the Board of Directors based on a nomination made pursuant to this Section
2.9 or pursuant to an agreement, arrangement or other understanding with one or more stockholders of record or beneficial owners, as the case may be, in lieu of such person being formally nominated as a director pursuant to this Section 2.9, in
each case, at one of the previous two annual meetings. If one or more vacancies for any reason occurs on the Board of Directors at any time after the Final Proxy Access Deadline but before the date of the applicable annual meeting of
stockholders and the Board of Directors determines to reduce the size of the Board of Directors in connection therewith, the Maximum Number shall be calculated based on the number of directors in office as so reduced. Any Nominator or Nominator
Group submitting more than one Stockholder Nominee for inclusion in the Corporation s proxy materials pursuant to this Section 2.9 shall rank in its Notice of Proxy Access Nomination such Stockholder Nominees based on the order that the
Nominator or Nominator Group desires such Stockholder Nominees to be selected for inclusion in the Corporation s proxy materials in the event that the total number of Stockholder Nominees submitted by Nominators or Nominator Groups pursuant to
this Section 2.9 exceeds the Maximum Number. In the event that the number of Stockholder Nominees submitted by Nominators or Nominator Groups pursuant to this Section 2.9 exceeds the Maximum Number, the highest ranking Stockholder Nominee who meets
the requirements of this Section 2.9 from each Nominator and Nominator Group will be selected for inclusion in the Corporation s proxy materials until the Maximum Number is reached, beginning with the Nominator or Nominator Group with the
largest number of shares disclosed as owned (as defined below) in its respective Notice of Proxy Access Nomination submitted to the Corporation and proceeding through each Nominator or Nominator Group in descending order of ownership. If the Maximum
Number is not reached after the highest ranking Stockholder Nominee who meets the requirements of this Section 2.9 from each Nominator and Nominator Group has been selected, this process will continue as many times as necessary, following the same
order each time, until the Maximum Number is reached. If, after the Final Proxy Access Deadline, whether before or after the mailing of the Corporation s definitive proxy statement, (i) a Stockholder Nominee who satisfies the requirements
of this Section 2.9 is thereafter nominated by the Board of Directors, (ii) a Stockholder Nominee who satisfies the requirements of this Section 2.9 becomes ineligible for inclusion in the Corporation s proxy materials pursuant to this Section
2.9, becomes unwilling to serve on the Board of Directors, dies, becomes disabled or is otherwise disqualified from being nominated for election or serving as a director of the Corporation or (iii) a Nominator or Nominator Group withdraws its
nomination or becomes ineligible, in the case of clauses (ii) or (iii) as determined by the Board of Directors or the chairman of the meeting, then the Stockholder Nominee shall be disregarded, no replacement nominee or nominees shall be included in
the Corporation s proxy materials or otherwise submitted for election as a director in substitution thereof and the Corporation (1) may omit from its proxy materials information concerning such Stockholder Nominee and (2) may otherwise
communicate to its stockholders, including without limitation by amending or supplementing its proxy materials, that the Stockholder Nominee will not be eligible for election at the annual meeting of stockholders and will not, or will no longer, be
included as a Stockholder Nominee in the proxy materials.

foregoing ownership requirement; (ii) the aggregate number of stockholders and all such beneficial owners whose share ownership is counted for the purposes of satisfying the foregoing ownership requirement shall not exceed 20; and (iii) in the case

(2) that a person or any of its affiliates has borrowed for any purposes or purchased pursuant to an agreement to resell or (3) that are subject to any  derivative security  (as such term is defined in Rule 16a-1(c) under the Exchange Act)
or similar agreement entered into by a person or any of its affiliates, whether any such security, instrument or agreement is to be settled with shares or with cash based on the notional amount or value of shares, in any case in which such security,
instrument or agreement has, or is intended to have, or if exercised by either party would have, the purpose or effect of (x) reducing in any manner, to any extent or at any time in the future, the person s or such person s
affiliates  full right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares, and/or (y) hedging, offsetting or altering to any degree gain or loss arising from the full economic ownership of such person s or such person s affiliates 
shares.  Ownership  shall include shares held in the name of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the person claiming ownership of such shares retains the right to instruct how the shares are voted with respect to the election
of directors and possesses the full economic interest in the shares. A person s ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which the person has delegated any voting power by means of a proxy, power of
 
      15  

attorney or other instrument or arrangement that is revocable at any time by the person. A person s ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which the person
has loaned such shares provided that the person has the power to recall such loaned shares on five business days  notice, will vote such shares at the annual meeting of stockholders and will hold such shares through the date of the annual
meeting. The determination of whether the requirements of  ownership  of shares for purposes of this Section 2.9 are met shall be made by the Board of Directors or chairman of the meeting, which determination shall be conclusive and
binding on the Corporation, its stockholders, beneficial owners and all other parties. For the purposes of this Section 2.9, the terms  owned,   owning  and other variations of the word  own  shall have correlative
meanings. For the purposes of this Section 2.9, the term  affiliate  or  affiliates  shall have the meaning ascribed thereto under the rules and regulations of the Exchange Act.  
 (E)     Notice of Defect.  For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any  nomination  submitted by a
Nominator Group pursuant to this Section 2.9, the information required by paragraphs (C) and (F) of this Section 2.9 to be included in the Notice of Proxy Access Nomination shall be provided by each Group Member (including any beneficial owner on
whose behalf the nomination is made) and each such Group Member (including any beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination is made) shall execute and deliver to the Secretary the representations and agreements required under paragraph (C) of
this Section 2.9 at the time the Notice of Proxy Access Nomination is submitted to the Corporation. In the event that the Nominator, Nominator Group or any Group Member shall have breached any of their agreements with the Corporation or any
information included in the Nomination Statement or the Notice of Proxy Access Nomination, or any other communications by the Nominator, Nominator Group or any Group Member (including any beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination is made) with
the Corporation or its stockholders, ceases to be true and correct in all material respects (or omits a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made and as of such later date, not
misleading), each Nominator, Nominator Group or Group Member (including any beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination is made), as the case may be, shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours of discovering such breach or that such
information has ceased to be true and correct in all material respects (or omits a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made and as of such later date, not misleading)) notify the
Secretary of any such breach, inaccuracy or omission in such previously provided information and shall provide the information that is required to correct any such defect, if applicable, it being understood that providing any such notification shall
not be deemed to cure any defect or limit the Corporation s rights to omit a Stockholder Nominee from its proxy materials as provided in this Section 2.9. All such information required to be included in the Notice of Proxy Access
Nomination shall be updated and supplemented, if necessary, in accordance with Section 2.8(C)(1). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, if any Nominator, Nominator Group or Group Member (including any beneficial owner on
whose behalf the nomination is made) has failed to comply with the requirements of this Section 2.9, the Board of Directors or the chairman of the meeting shall declare the nomination by such Nominator or Nominator Group to be invalid, and such
nomination shall be disregarded.    (F)     Stockholder Nominee Requirements . 
      16  

(1)    Within the time period specified in this Section 2.9 for delivering
the Notice of Proxy Access Nomination, each Stockholder Nominee must deliver to the Secretary a written representation and agreement, which shall be deemed a part of the Notice of Proxy Access Nomination for purposes of this Section 2.9, that such
person: (1) consents to be named in the proxy statement as a nominee, to serve as a director on the Corporation s Board of Directors if elected and to the public disclosure of the information provided pursuant to this Section 2.9; (2)

of Directors or that otherwise relates to the Corporation or the Stockholder Nominee s service on the Board of Directors (a  Voting Commitment ) that has not been disclosed to the Corporation or (y) any Voting Commitment that could
limit or interfere with such person s ability to comply, if elected as a director of the Corporation, with such person s fiduciary duties under applicable law; (4) is not and will not become a party to any compensatory, payment or other
financial agreement, arrangement or other understanding with any person other than with the Corporation that has not been disclosed to the Corporation, including any agreement to indemnify such Stockholder Nominee for obligations arising as a result
of his or her service as a director of the Corporation, and has not and will not receive any such compensation or other payment from any person other than the Corporation that has not been disclosed to the Corporation, in each case, in connection
with such nominee s nomination, service or action as a director of the Corporation; (5) if elected as a director of the Corporation, will comply with all applicable laws and stock exchange listing standards and the Corporation s policies,

under which they were made, not misleading.    (2)    At the request of the Corporation, each Stockholder Nominee must
promptly submit (but in no event later than seven days after receipt of the request) to the Secretary all completed and signed questionnaires required of directors. The Corporation may request such additional information as necessary to permit the
Board of Directors to determine if each nominee is independent, including for purposes of serving on the committees of the Board, under the listing standards of each principal securities exchange upon which the shares are listed, any applicable
rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and any publicly disclosed standards used by the Board of Directors in determining and disclosing the independence of the Corporation s directors and to determine whether the nominee otherwise
meets all other publicly disclosed standards applicable to directors.    (3)    In the event that the Stockholder
Nominee shall have breached any of their agreements with the Corporation or any information or communications provided by a  
      17  

Stockholder Nominee to the Corporation or its stockholders and beneficial owners ceases to be true and correct in any respect or omits a fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, such nominee shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours of discovering such breach or that such information has ceased to be true and correct in all material respects (or omits a
material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made and as of such later date, not misleading)) notify the Secretary of any such breach, inaccuracy or omission in such previously provided
information and shall provide the information that is required to make such information or communication true and correct, if applicable, it being understood that providing any such notification shall not be deemed to cure any defect or limit the
Corporation s rights to omit a Stockholder Nominee from its proxy materials as provided in this Section 2.9.  
 (G)     Exclusions.  In the event any Nominator or Nominator Group (or any beneficial owner on whose behalf the
nomination is made) submits a nomination at an annual meeting of stockholders pursuant to this Section 2.9 and either (a) such Nominator or any Group Member of such Nominator Group (or any beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination is made) had
nominated (or been a Group Member (or a beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination is made) of a nominator group that had nominated) a nominee for election to the Board of Directors pursuant to this Section 2.9 at any of the previous two annual
meetings and such nominee shall not have received at least 10% of the votes cast in favor of such nominee s election or such nominee withdrew from or became ineligible or unavailable for election to the Board of Directors, or (b) such
Stockholder Nominee shall have been nominated for election pursuant to this Section 2.9 at any of the previous two annual meetings of stockholders and such Stockholder Nominee shall not have received at least 25% of the votes cast in favor of such
nominee s election or such nominee withdrew from or became ineligible or unavailable for election to the Board of Directors, then such nomination shall be disregarded. Any Nominator, Nominator Group or Group Member (including any
beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination is made) whose Stockholder Nominee is elected as a director at the annual meeting of stockholders will not be eligible to nominate or participate in the nomination of a Stockholder Nominee for the
following two annual meetings of stockholders other than the nomination of such previously elected Stockholder Nominee.  
 (H)     Disqualification.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.9, the Corporation
shall not be required to include, pursuant to this Section 2.9, a Stockholder Nominee in its  proxy  materials for any annual meeting of stockholders, or, if the proxy statement already has been filed, to submit the nomination of a Stockholder
Nominee to a vote at the annual meeting of stockholders, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation:  
 (1)    for any meeting for which the Secretary receives notice that any stockholder or beneficial owner, as the case may
be, intends to nominate one or more persons for election to the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 2.8(A)(1)(c);  
 (2)    if any person is nominated pursuant to an agreement, arrangement or other understanding with one or more

      18  

Directors pursuant to Section 2.8(A)(1)(c) or if any director then in office was previously nominated by a stockholder or pursuant to Section 2.8(A)(1)(c) or pursuant to an agreement, arrangement
or other understanding with one or more stockholders or beneficial owners, as the case may be, in lieu of such person being formally proposed as a nominee for election to the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 2.8(A)(1)(c), in each case, at one
of the previous two annual meetings of stockholders;    (3)    who is not determined by the Board of Directors in its
sole discretion to be independent under the listing standards of each principal securities exchange upon which the shares of the Corporation are listed, any applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and any publicly disclosed

Directors, in each case, as determined by the Board of Directors or any committee thereof, in its sole discretion;

Bylaws, the Corporation s Certificate of Incorporation, the rules and listing standards of the principal securities exchanges upon which the shares of the Corporation are listed, or any applicable law, rule or regulation or of any publicly
disclosed standards of the Corporation applicable to directors, in each case, as determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion;

of the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, as amended;    (6)    whose business or personal interests place such Stockholder
Nominee in a conflict of interest with the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries that would cause such Stockholder Nominee to violate any fiduciary duties of directors established pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware,
including but not limited to, the duty of loyalty and duty of care, as determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion;  
 (7)    who is a named subject of a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses) or

the type specified in Rule 506(d) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended;    (9)    if the

participant (as defined in Schedule 14A under the Exchange Act) in, a  solicitation  within the meaning of Rule 14a-1(l) under the Exchange Act in support of the election of any individual as a director at the applicable annual meeting
other than a nominee of the Board; or    (12)    the Nominator or, in the case of a Nominator Group, any Group Member,
or applicable Stockholder Nominee otherwise breaches or fails to comply with its representations or obligations pursuant to these Bylaws, including, without limitation, this Section 2.9.

Section 2.9 of the specific Stockholder Nominee to whom the ineligibility applies, or, if the proxy statement already has been filed, the ineligibility of the Stockholder Nominee and, in either case, the inability of the Nominator or Nominator Group
that nominated such Stockholder Nominee to substitute another Stockholder Nominee therefor; however, subparagraphs (1) and (2) will result in the exclusion from the proxy materials pursuant to this Section 2.9 of all Stockholder Nominees for the
applicable annual meeting of stockholders, or, if the proxy statement already has been filed, the ineligibility of all Stockholder Nominees.  
 (I)     Nomination Statement.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.9, the
Corporation may omit from its proxy materials any information, including all or any portion of the Nomination Statement, if the Board of Directors determines that the disclosure of such information would violate any applicable law or regulation or
that such information is not true and correct in all material respects or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  
 (J)      Exclusivity.  The Board of Directors (or any other person or body authorized by the Board of Directors)

owners and all other parties. This Section 2.9 shall be the exclusive method for stockholders to include nominees for director in the Corporation s proxy materials.  
      20  

Section 2.10     Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of
Record .    (A)    In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of
stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall,
unless otherwise required by law, not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting. If the Board of Directors so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders
entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board of Directors determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed
by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is
waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the
meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of
such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance herewith at the adjourned meeting.  
 (B)    In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other
distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date
shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) days prior to such action. If no such record date is fixed, the record date for determining
stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

have such responsibilities as shall be specified in the designating resolution. In the absence or disqualification of any member of such committee or committees, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from
voting, whether or not constituting a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. A majority of any committee may determine its action
and fix the time and place of its meetings, unless the Board of Directors shall otherwise provide. Notice of such meetings shall be given to each member of the committee in the manner provided for in Section 3.5 of these Bylaws. The Board
of Directors shall have power at any time to fill vacancies in, to change the membership of, or to dissolve any such committee. Except as otherwise provided by law, the presence of a majority of the members of a committee shall constitute a
quorum for the transaction of business by that committee, and in every case where a quorum is present the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the committee present shall be the act of the committee.

UNCERTIFICATED SHARES    Section 5.1     Form . The shares of stock of the Corporation shall be represented by
certificates, provided that the Board of Directors may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a
certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the Corporation. Every holder of stock represented by certificates shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by or in the name of the Corporation by the Chairman of the Board of
Directors, if any, or the President or a vice president, and by the Treasurer or an assistant treasurer, or the Secretary or an assistant secretary, of the Corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate form. Any of or
all the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent, or
registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if such person were such officer, transfer agent, or registrar at the date of issue.  
 Section 5.2     Lost, Stolen, Destroyed or Mutilated Certificates . A new certificate of stock or uncertificated
shares may be issued in the place of any certificate previously issued by the Corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the Corporation may, in its discretion, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or
his, her or its legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond, in such sum as the Corporation may direct, in order to indemnify the Corporation against any claims that may be made against it in connection therewith. A new certificate or
uncertificated shares of stock may be issued in the place of any  
      24  

certificate previously issued by the Corporation that has become mutilated upon the surrender by such owner of such mutilated certificate and, if required by the Corporation, the posting of a
bond by such owner in an amount sufficient to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against it in connection therewith.  
 Section 5.3     Transfers . Shares of stock of the Corporation shall be transferable upon its books by the
holders thereof, in person or by their duly authorized attorneys or legal representatives, upon surrender to the Corporation by delivery thereof (to the extent extend evidenced by a physical stock certificate) to the person in charge of the stock

not represented by a certificate shall be transferred in accordance with applicable law. A record shall be made of each transfer. Whenever any transfer of shares shall be made for collateral security, and not absolutely, it shall be so
expressed in the entry of the transfer if, when the certificates are presented or uncertificated shares are requested to be transferred, both the transferor and transferee request the Corporation to do so. The Board of Directors shall have
power and authority to make such rules and regulations as it may deem necessary or proper concerning the issue, transfer and registration of shares of stock of the Corporation and of the certificates, if any, representing such shares.

 Section 6.3     Seal . The corporate seal shall be in such form as the Board of Directors shall prescribe.  
 Section 6.4     List of Stockholders Entitled To Vote . The officer who has charge of the stock ledger shall
prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting (provided, however, that if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less
than ten (10) days before the date of the meeting, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth (10th) day before the meeting date), arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the
number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting (a) on a reasonably accessible
electronic network; provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of meeting, or (b) during ordinary business hours at the principal place of business of the Corporation. In the event that the
Corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place,
then a list of stockholders  
      25  

entitled to vote at the meeting shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be examined by any stockholder who is present. If the
meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to
access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. Except as otherwise provided by law, the stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the list of stockholders required by this
Section 6.4 or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.    Section 6.5     Waiver of
Notice . Whenever any notice is required to be given to any stockholder or director of the Corporation under the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a waiver
thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to
notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business
because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any annual or special meeting of the stockholders or the Board of Directors need be specified in any waiver of notice of such
meeting.    Section 6.6     Audits . The accounts, books and records of the Corporation shall be audited upon
the conclusion of each fiscal year by an independent certified public accountant, and it shall be the duty of the Board of Directors to cause such audit to be made annually.  
 Section 6.7     Resignations . Any director or any officer, whether elected or appointed, may resign at any time
by serving written notice of such resignation on the Chairman of the Board, the President or the Secretary, and such resignation shall be deemed to be effective as of the close of business on the date said notice is received by the Chairman of the
Board, the President, or the Secretary, unless otherwise specified in said notice. No formal action shall be required of the Board of Directors or the stockholders to make any such resignation effective.  
 Section 6.8     Indemnification and Insurance . (A) Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to
be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a  proceeding ), by reason of the fact that he or she or a person of whom he or she is the legal
representative is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while serving as a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or
of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, against all expense, liability and loss (including, without limitation, attorneys  fees, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably
incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators; provided,
however, that except as provided in paragraph (B) of this Section 6.8 of this Bylaw with respect to  
      26  

proceedings seeking to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by
such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized in the first instance by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.  
 (B)    If a claim under paragraph (A) of this Section 6.8 of this Bylaw is not paid in full by the Corporation within
thirty days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, or if a claim for any advancement of expenses under this Section 6.8 is not paid in full within thirty days after the Corporation has received a statement or statements
requesting such amounts to be advanced, the claimant may at any time thereafter (but not before) bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to
be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim to the fullest extent permitted by law. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of
its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, any committee of the
Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, any committee of the Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or
stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.  
 (C)    The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its
final disposition conferred in this Bylaw shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise.    (D)    The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect
itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to
indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.  
 (E)    The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to
indemnification, and rights to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Bylaw with
respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.  
      27  

(F)    The right to indemnification conferred in this Bylaw on the persons
entitled thereto shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that if the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware requires the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or
officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, such advancement shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director
or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Bylaw or otherwise.  
 (G)    For the avoidance of doubt, claimant s right to indemnification and advancement of expenses provided under
this Article VI shall (i) vest at the time that such claimant becomes a director or officer of the Corporation or at the time such claimant becomes a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, at the request of the Corporation and (ii) continue as to the claimant even though such claimant may have ceased to be a director or officer of the Corporation.
   (H)    Any amendment or modification of these Bylaws affecting a claimant s right to indemnification or the
advancement of expenses provided under this Article VI shall not alter the claimant s right to indemnification or the advancement of expenses with respect to such claimant s conduct prior to the amendment or modification, without the
express written consent of such claimant.    Section 6.9     Forum Selection . Unless the Corporation consents
in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the
Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation s stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising
pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in
shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Section 6.9.  
 ARTICLE VII    AMENDMENTS  
 Section 7.1     Amendments . Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation or applicable law,
these Bylaws may be altered, amended, rescinded or repealed in whole or in part, or new Bylaws may be adopted by (i) the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of Directors or (ii) the holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding
capital stock of the Corporation, provided that, in the case of any such amendment by the stockholders voted on at a meeting of stockholders, notice of the proposed change was given in the notice of the meeting of stockholders.
