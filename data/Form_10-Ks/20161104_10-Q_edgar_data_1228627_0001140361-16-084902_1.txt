Operations and Organization

Operations

Rexahn Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the  Company ), a Delaware corporation, is a biopharmaceutical company whose principal operations are the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative treatments for cancer.  The Company had an accumulated deficit of $ 114,498,726  at September 30, 2016 and anticipates incurring losses through fiscal year 2016 and beyond.  The Company has not yet generated commercial revenues and has funded its operating losses to date through the sale of shares of its common stock and warrants to purchase shares of its common stock, convertible debt, financings, interest income from cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and proceeds from reimbursed research and development costs.  The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, will be sufficient to cover its cash flow requirements for its current activities for at least the next 12 months.  Management believes it has the capability of managing the Company s operations within existing cash available by focusing on select research and development activities, selecting projects in conjunction with potential financings and milestones, and efficiently managing its general and administrative affairs. 

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial information.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ) for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of the Company s management, all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the Company s financial position as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and of the results of operations and comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the results of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been included.  Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any other interim period or the full fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the  2015 Form 10-K ).  Information included in the condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 has been derived from the Company s audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the 2015 Form 10-K.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  These estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future.  Actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates.  These estimates are reviewed periodically, and as adjustments become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the period in which they become available.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Affecting the Company

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers,  a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The standard s core principle is that a company should recognize revenue when it transfers goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services, and provides a revenue recognition framework in accordance with this principle.  On August 12, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year to December 15, 2017 for annual reporting periods beginning after that date and interim periods therein.  Early adoption of the standard is permitted, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on its financial statements and future operating results.

Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,  which requires management to perform interim and annual assessments as to the entity s ability to continue as a going concern and provides related disclosure guidance.  ASU 2014-15 will be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on its financial statements.

Leases

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases,  which requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities arising from leases on the balance sheet and to provide additional disclosures about leasing arrangements.  ASU 2016-02 will be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on its financial statements.

Compensation-Stock Compensation

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation-Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share Based Payment Accounting,  which includes multiple provisions intended to simplify various aspects of accounting for share-based payments.  The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on its financial statements.

Marketable Securities

Marketable securities are considered  available-for-sale  in accordance with FASB Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC ) 320,  Debt and Equity Securities,  and thus are reported at fair value in the Company s accompanying balance sheet, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders  equity.  Amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into realized gains and losses are accounted for on the basis of specific identification and are included in other income or expense in the statement of operations.  The Company classifies such investments as current on the balance sheet as the investments are readily marketable and available for use in current operations.

The following table shows the Company s marketable securities  adjusted cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, and fair value by significant investment category as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.  As of September 30, 2016 the Company had five investments of commercial paper with an aggregate fair value of $4,975,230 and unrealized losses of $1,152, and four corporate bonds with an aggregate fair value of $4,044,320 and unrealized losses of $4,889 all of which have been unrealized losses for less than 12 months.   The Company does not intend to sell its marketable securities in an unrealized loss position.  Based upon these securities  fair value relative to the cost, high ratings, and volatility of fair value, the Company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities to be temporary in nature and does not consider any of its investments other-than-temporarily impaired, and anticipates that it will recover the entire amortized cost basis.

As of September 30 2016, all of the Company s marketable securities are due to mature in less than one year.

Deferred Research and Development Arrangements

Rexgene Biotech Co., Ltd.

In 2003, the Company entered into a collaborative research agreement with Rexgene Biotech Co., Ltd. ( Rexgene ), a shareholder.  Rexgene is engaged in the development of pharmaceutical products in Asia and has agreed to assist the Company with the research, development and clinical trials necessary for registration of the Company s drug candidate Archexin in Asia.  This agreement provides Rexgene with exclusive rights to license, sublicense, make, have made, use, sell and import Archexin in Asia.  In accordance with the agreement, Rexgene paid the Company a one-time fee of $1, 500,000  in 2003.  The agreement terminates at the later of 20 years or the term of the patent.  The amortization reduces research and development expenses for the periods presented. 

The Company is using 20 years as its basis for recognition and accordingly research and development expenses were reduced by  $18,750 and $56,250  for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The remaining $468,750 and $525,000 to be amortized at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, is reflected as a deferred research and development arrangement on the balance sheet.  The payment from Rexgene is being used in the cooperative funding of the costs of development of Archexin. Royalties of 3% of net sales of licensed products will become payable by Rexgene to the Company on a quarterly basis once commercial sales of Archexin begin in Asia.  The product is still under development and commercial sales in Asia are not expected to begin until at least 2017.  Under the terms of the agreement, Rexgene does not     pay royalties on the Company s net sales outside of Asia.

Other Liabilities

Deferred Lease Incentive

In accordance with the Company s office lease agreement, as amended and further discussed in Note 14, the Company has been granted leasehold improvement allowances from the lessor to be used for the construction cost of improvements to the leased property, which included architectural and engineering fees, government agency plan check, permit and other fees, sales and use taxes, testing and inspection costs and telephone and data cabling and wiring in the premises.  The Company accounted for the benefit of the leasehold improvement allowance as a reduction of rental expense over the term of the office lease.

The following table sets forth the cumulative deferred lease incentive:

Deferred Office Lease Expense

The lease agreement, as amended, provided for an initial annual base rent with annual increases over the lease term.  The Company recognizes rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, which resulted in a deferred rent liability of $51,681 and $60,468 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

 Net Loss per Common Share

Basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period.  Diluted loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding, plus the number of common share equivalents that would be dilutive.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were stock options and warrants to acquire, in the aggregate, 72,300,887 and 39,082,886 shares of the Company s common stock, respectively, that are potentially dilutive. However, diluted loss per share for all periods presented is the same as basic loss per share because the inclusion of common share equivalents would be anti-dilutive.

At the Company s Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on June 10, 2013, the Company s stockholders voted to approve the Rexahn Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2013 Stock Option Plan (the  2013 Plan ).

Accounting for Awards

Stock option compensation expense is the estimated fair value of options granted amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite vesting service period for the entire portion of the award.

Summary of Stock Option Transactions

There were 5,876,391 stock options granted at exercise prices ranging from $0. 26  to $0. 37  with an aggregate fair value of $ 1,150,513  during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

The expected volatility is based upon historical volatility of the Company s stock.  The expected term is based upon the simplified method as allowed under SAB 107.

The assumptions made in calculating the fair values of options are as follows:

As of September 30, 2016, warrants to purchase 54,526,847 shares were outstanding, having exercise prices ranging from $0.30   to $1. 28  and expiration dates ranging from December 4, 2017 to March 19, 20 22 . 

At September 30, 2016 the weighted average remaining contractual life of the outstanding warrants was 4. 5  years. 

The warrants issued to investors in the December 2012, November 2015, March 2016, September 2016, and previous offerings contain a provision for net cash settlement in the event that there is a fundamental transaction (contractually defined as a merger, sale of substantially all assets, tender offer or share exchange).  If a fundamental transaction occurs in which the consideration issued consists principally of cash or stock in a non-public company, then the warrant holder has the option to receive cash, equal to the fair value of the remaining unexercised portion of the warrant.  Due to this contingent redemption provision, the warrants require liability classification in accordance with ASC 480 and are recorded at fair value.  The warrants issued to investors in the July 2013, October 2013 and January 2014 offerings contain a fundamental transaction provision, but the warrant holders only have an option as to the type of consideration received if the holders of common stock receive an option as to their consideration.  In addition, the warrants issued in the December 2012, July 2013, October 2013, January 2014, November 2015, March 2016, September 2016 and previous offerings contain a cashless exercise provision that is exercisable only in the event that a registration statement is not effective. That provision may not be operative if an effective registration statement is not available because an exemption under the U.S. securities laws may not be available to issue unregistered shares.  As a result, net cash settlement may be required, and the warrants require liability classification.

ASC 820 provides requirements for disclosure of liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis in periods subsequent to the initial recognition.  Fair values for warrants were determined using the Binomial Lattice ( Lattice ) valuation technique. The Lattice model provides for dynamic assumptions regarding volatility and risk-free interest rates within the total period to maturity. Accordingly, within the contractual term, the Company provided multiple date intervals over which multiple volatilities and risk free interest rates were used. These intervals allow the Lattice model to project outcomes along specific paths that consider volatilities and risk free rates that would be more likely in an early exercise scenario.

Significant assumptions are determined as follows:

Trading market values   Published trading market values;

Exercise price   Stated exercise price;

Term   Remaining contractual term of the warrant;

Volatility   Historical trading volatility for periods consistent with the remaining terms; and

Risk-free rate   Yields on zero coupon government securities with remaining terms consistent with the remaining terms of the warrants.

Due to the fundamental transaction provision, which could provide for early redemption of the warrants, the model also considered the probability the Company would enter into a fundamental transaction during the remaining term of the warrant. Because the Company is not yet achieving positive cash flow, management believes the probability of a fundamental transaction occurring over the term of the warrant is unlikely and therefore estimates the probability of entering into a fundamental transaction to be 5%.  For valuation purposes, the Company also assumed that if such a transaction did occur, it was more likely to occur towards the end of the term of the warrants.

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the warrants include management s estimate of the probability that a fundamental transaction may occur in the future.  Significant increases (decreases) in the probability of occurrence would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement.

No provision for federal and state income taxes was required for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 due to the Company s operating losses and increased deferred tax asset valuation allowance.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had unused net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $110,482,000 and $ 98,954,000 , respectively, which expire at various dates through 203 6 .  Some of this amount may be subject to annual limitations under certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code related to  changes in ownership.  

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the deferred tax assets related to the aforementioned carry-forwards have been fully offset by valuation allowances, because significant utilization of such amounts is not presently expected in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets and valuation allowances consist of:

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal and Maryland state jurisdictions.  Tax years for fiscal 2013 through 2015 are open and potentially subject to examination by the federal and Maryland state taxing authorities.

Fair Value Measurements

ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, not adjusted for transaction costs.  ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).

The three levels are described below:

Level 1 Inputs

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible by the Company;

Level 2 Inputs

Quoted prices in markets that are not active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; and

Level 3 Inputs

Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability including significant assumptions of the Company and other market participants.

The following tables present assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy.  There have been no changes in the methodologies used at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

The fair value of the Company s Level 2 marketable securities is determined by using quoted prices from independent pricing services that use market data for comparable securities in active or inactive markets.  A variety of data inputs, including benchmark yields, interest rates, known historical trades and broker dealer quotes are used with pricing models to determine the quoted prices.

The fair value methodology for the warrant liabilities is disclosed in Note 12.

The carrying amounts reported in the financial statements for cash and cash equivalents (Level 1), prepaid expenses, and other assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short term maturity of these financial instruments.

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of changes in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 in the fair value of the liabilities classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy:

Additions consist of the fair value of warrant liabilities upon issuance.  Transfers out of Level 3 for warrant liabilities consist of warrant exercises,  where  the liability is converted to additional paid-in capital upon exercise.   The  Company s policy is to recognize transfers in and transfers out as of the actual date of the event or change in circumstance that caused the transfer.

We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative treatments for cancer. Our mission is to improve the lives of cancer patients by developing next-generation cancer therapies that are designed to maximize efficacy while minimizing the toxicity and side effects traditionally associated with cancer treatment. Our clinical pipeline features one product candidate in Phase II clinical development, one product candidate in Phase Ib/IIa clinical development, one product candidate in Phase I clinical development and additional compounds in pre-clinical development. Our strategy is to continue building a significant pipeline of innovative oncology product candidates that we will commercialize alone or with partners. Our three clinical stage drug candidates in active development are Archexin , RX-3117 and Supinoxin TM  (RX-5902).

Archexin  is a potential best-in-class, potent inhibitor of the protein kinase Akt-1, which we believe plays a critical role in cancer cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, metastasis and drug resistance. Archexin has received  orphan drug  designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the  FDA ) for renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ), glioblastoma, ovarian cancer, stomach cancer and pancreatic cancer. Orphan drug designation provides tax incentives for clinical research and a waiver from user fees under certain circumstances. In addition, an orphan drug receives seven years of exclusivity after approval, during which the FDA generally cannot approve another product with the same active moiety for the same indication. We have completed a pilot Phase IIa clinical trial of Archexin for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. We are currently conducting a Phase IIa proof-of-concept clinical trial of Archexin in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma to evaluate its safety and efficacy in combination with everolimus.

RX-3117  is a small molecule nucleoside compound that we believe has therapeutic potential in a broad range of cancers, including pancreatic, bladder, colon, and lung cancer. We previously completed a Phase Ib clinical trial of RX-3117 and identified a recommended Phase II dose.  In this trial, RX-3117 appeared to be safe and well tolerated with a predictable pharmacokinetic profile for an orally-administered agent with preliminary evidence of single agent activity.  We then initiated a two stage Phase Ib/IIa clinical trial of RX-3117 in patients with relapsed/refractory pancreatic cancer.  Based on achieving the predefined efficacy criteria in stage 1, stage 2 of the study has now been initiated.  We also commenced enrollment in a Phase Ib/IIa trial in patients with advanced bladder cancer.

Supinoxin , or RX-5902, is a potential first-in-class small molecule inhibitor of phosphorylated-p68, a protein that we believe plays a key role in cancer cell growth, progression and metastasis. We are currently conducting a Phase I clinical trial of Supinoxin to evaluate its safety and efficacy and maximum tolerated dose in patients with solid tumors.

Since our inception, our efforts and resources have been focused primarily on developing our pharmaceutical technologies, raising capital and recruiting personnel.  We have no product sales to date, and we will not generate any product sales until we receive approval from the FDA or equivalent foreign regulatory bodies to begin selling our pharmaceutical candidates.  Our major sources of working capital have been proceeds from various private and public financings, and licensing and collaboration agreements with our strategic investors and partners.

Results of Operations

Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015

Total Revenues

We had no revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive, finance and other administrative personnel, recruitment expenses, professional fees and other corporate expenses, including business development, investor relations, and general legal activities.

General and administrative expenses decreased approximately $136,000, or 8.7%, to $1,419,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1,555,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  General and administrative expenses decreased approximately $174,000 or 3.7%, to $4,490,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $4,664,000 for nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease is primarily attributable to lower personnel costs and professional fees in 2016.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses decreased approximately $805,000, or 25.9%, to $2,299,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $3,104,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Research and development expenses decreased approximately $1,228,000, or 13.3%, to $8,004,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $9,232,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Decreased research and development costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were primarily attributable to lower manufacturing costs for our drug candidates due to a significant supply of our drug candidates already being available to us from earlier manufacturing campaigns.  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred approximately $358,000 of drug manufacturing costs, compared to approximately $1,623,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred approximately $2,325,000 of drug manufacturing costs, compared to approximately $4,665,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Because the volume and timing of drug manufacturing does not correlate directly with the level and timing of clinical trial activity, we expect expenses related to drug manufacturing costs to vary from period to period based not only on the progress of clinical trials, but also when we engage in manufacturing activities.  The decreases to drug manufacturing costs were offset by increases in clinical costs related to patient and site enrollment.  We expect expenses to increase in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2016 due to increased patient enrollments in our clinical trials and new manufacturing campaigns.

Table of Contents 

The table below summarizes the approximate amounts incurred on each of our research and development projects for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

Interest Income

Interest income remained relatively flat, increasing $2,421 and $2,558, or 10.2% and 3.1%, respectively, from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015.

Unrealized Gain on Fair Value of Warrants

Our warrants are recorded as liabilities at fair value, and the warrants are valued using a lattice model.  Changes in the fair value of warrants are recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in our statement of operations.  During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded unrealized gains on the fair value of our warrants of approximately $968,000 and 608,000 respectively.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded unrealized gains on the fair value of our warrants of approximately $3,942,000 and $2,282,000 respectively.  Estimating fair values of warrants requires the development of significant and subjective estimates that may, and are likely to, change over the duration of the warrants due to related changes to external market factors. The unrealized gains for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily resulted from a decreased price of the underlying common stock at September 30, 2016 and an increase in the number of outstanding warrants.

Financing Expense

We incurred approximately $143,000 of financing expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016, related to our registered direct offering in September 2016 and approximately $313,000 of financing expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 related to our registered direct offerings in March 2016 and September 2016.  We did not incur financing expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Net Loss

As a result of the above, net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $2,867,000 and $8,782,000, or $0.01 and $0.04 per share, respectively, compared to approximately $4,027,000 and $11,532,000, or $0.02 and $0.06, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.

Research and Development Projects

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.  These costs consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs, costs to acquire pharmaceutical products and product rights for development and amounts paid to contract research organizations, hospitals and laboratories for the provision of services and materials for drug development and clinical trials.  Costs incurred in obtaining the license rights to technology in the research and development stage that have no alternative future uses are expensed as incurred.  Our research and development programs are related to our oncology clinical stage drug candidates, Archexin, RX-3117 and Supinoxin, and our pre-clinical stage drug candidate, RX-21101.  As we expand our clinical studies, we expect to enter into additional development agreements.  Significant additional expenditures will be required if we complete our clinical trials, start new trials, apply for regulatory approvals, continue development of our technologies, expand our operations and bring our products to market.  The eventual total cost of each clinical trial is dependent on a number of uncertainties such as trial design, the length of the trial, the number of clinical sites and the number of patients.  The process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for new therapeutic products is lengthy, expensive and uncertain.  Because the successful development of our most advanced drug candidates, Archexin, RX-3117 and Supinoxin, is uncertain, and because RX-21101 is in early-stage development, we are unable to estimate the costs of completing our research and development programs, the timing of bringing such programs to market and, therefore, when material cash inflows could commence from the sale of these drug candidates, if any.  If these projects are not completed as planned, our results of operations and financial condition would be negatively affected.

Archexin

Archexin is a potential best-in-class, potent inhibitor of the protein kinase Akt-1, which we believe plays a critical role in cancer cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, metastasis and drug resistance.  We are currently conducting a Phase IIa proof-of-concept clinical trial of Archexin in patients with metastatic RCC to evaluate its safety and efficacy.  The trial is being conducted in two stages.  Stage 1, which we completed in January 2016, was a dose ranging study, with up to three dose groups with three RCC patients each, to determine Archexin s MTD in combination with everolimus.  Stage 2, which commenced in January 2016, is a randomized, open-label, two-arm dose expansion study of everolimus versus Archexin in combination with everolimus to determine safety and efficacy of the combination.  Stage 2 is anticipated to enroll up to 30 RCC patients who will be randomized to receive either Archexin in combination with everolimus, or everolimus alone, in a ratio of 2:1 The MTD of 250 mg/m 2 /day of Archexin, which was identified in Stage 1, will be administered in Stage 2 along with 10 mg of everolimus compared to 10 mg everolimus alone.

29 

Table of Contents 

Expenses related to Archexin slightly increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, which was primarily attributable to increased patient enrollments as we progress through Stage 2 of the trial.  We expect that expenses related to Archexin will increase for the remainder of 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2016 as we continue Stage 2 of the ongoing Archexin clinical trial.

RX-3117

RX-3117 is a novel, investigational oral small molecule nucleoside compound.  We believe  RX-3117 has therapeutic potential in a broad range of cancers including pancreatic, bladder, cervical, non-small cell lung cancer and colon cancer.  We previously identified the MTD of RX-3117, which we are evaluating in  a Phase Ib/IIa proof-of-concept clinical trial in patients with relapsed and refractory pancreatic cancer and advanced bladder cancer. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we completed stage 1 and entered stage 2 of the pancreatic cancer clinical trial.  The decision to proceed with stage 2 was based on satisfying predefined criteria for preliminary efficacy for stage 1 of the trial.  During the most recent quarter, we also initiated stage 1 of the bladder cancer clinical trial.

Expenses related to RX-3117 decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily attributable to decreased manufacturing costs incurred in connection with our Phase I and Phase Ib/IIa trials.  However, we expect expenses will increase in the remainder of 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2016 due to patient enrollment costs.

Supinoxin (RX-5902)

Supinoxin is a potential first-in-class small molecule inhibitor of phosphorylated p68, a protein that we believe plays a key role in cancer growth, progression and metastasis. Phosphorylated p68 results in up-regulation of cancer-related genes and a subsequent proliferation of cancer cells and tumor growth.   Supinoxin is currently being evaluated in a Phase I dose-escalation clinical trial in cancer patients with solid tumors designed to evaluate its safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities and MTD. Secondary endpoints include pharmacokinetic analyses and an evaluation of the preliminary anti-tumor effects of Supinoxin.   We plan to commence a Phase Ib/IIa clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Supinoxin in patients with triple negative breast cancer and relapsed/refractory ovarian cancer.

Expenses related to Supinoxin decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily attributable to decreased manufacturing costs due to a significant supply of drug product already available from earlier manufacturing campaigns.  We expect that expenses related to Supinoxin will increase in the remainder of 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2016 as we expect to reach the MTD or recommended Phase Ib/IIa dose in 2016 and expect to continue development with our planned Phase Ib/IIa study.

Pre-clinical Pipeline

Expenses related to our pre-clinical candidates increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 as we continued development of our pipeline.  We expect that expenses related to our pre-clinical pipeline, including RX-21101, will increase slightly in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 2015 as we continue testing and development.

Research and Development Process

We have engaged third-party contract research organizations and other investigators and collaborators, such as universities and medical institutions, to conduct our pre-clinical studies, toxicology studies and clinical trials.   Engaging third-party contract research organizations is typical practice in our industry. However, relying on such organizations means that the clinical trials and other studies described above are being conducted at external locations and that the completion of these trials and studies is not within our direct control. Trials and studies may be delayed due to circumstances outside our control, and such delays may result in additional expenses for us.

Liquidity and Capital     Resources 

Cash Flows

Cash used in operating activities was approximately $11,734,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The operating cash flows during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflect a net loss of $8,782,000, an unrealized gain on the fair value of warrants of $3,942,000 and a net increase of cash components of working capital and non-cash charges totaling $990,000.  Cash used in operating activities was approximately $12,944,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The operating cash flows during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 reflect our net loss of $11,532,000, and a net decrease of cash components of working capital and other non-cash charges totaling $1,412,000.

Cash used in investing activities was approximately $196,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which consisted of $8,748,000 and $8,000 for the purchases of marketable securities and equipment, respectively, offset by $8,560,000 from the redemption of marketable securities.

Contractual Obligations

We have a variety of contractual obligations, as more fully described in our 2015 Form 10-K.  These obligations include, but are not limited to, contractual obligations in connection with license agreements (including related milestone payments), lease payments, employee compensation and incentive program expenses, and contracts with various vendors for research and development services.  As of September 30, 2016, the total estimated cost to complete our contracts with vendors for research and development services was approximately $6,180,000 under the terms of the applicable agreements.  All of these agreements may be terminated by either party upon appropriate notice as stipulated in the respective agreements.

Current and Future Financing Needs

We have incurred negative cash flow from operations since we started our business.  We have spent, and expect to continue to spend, substantial amounts in connection with implementing our business strategy, including our planned product development efforts, our clinical trials and our research and development efforts.  We will need to raise additional capital through public or private equity or debt offerings or through arrangements with strategic partners or other sources in order to continue to develop our drug candidates.  There can be no assurance that additional capital will be available when needed or on terms satisfactory to us, if at all.  If we are not able to raise sufficient additional capital, we will have to reduce our research and development activities. We believe our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to cover our cash flow requirements for our current activities for at least the next 12 months.

The actual amount of funds we will need to operate is subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control.  These factors include the following:

the progress of our product development activities;

the number and scope of our product development programs;

the progress of our pre-clinical and clinical trial activities;

the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we have entered into collaboration agreements;

our ability to maintain current collaboration programs and to establish new collaboration arrangements;

the costs involved in prosecuting and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and

the costs and timing of regulatory approvals.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or holdings in variable interest entities.

Controls and Procedures.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were effective such that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s (the  SEC s ) rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 2. 
 
    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.

Pursuant to consulting agreements, we issued 135,000 shares of common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2016 to two privately held investor relations firms in consideration for investor relations services.  The shares of common stock were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), pursuant to the exemption from registration requirements provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, as transactions not involving a public offering.

(d)           By the Executive Without Good Reason  .  The Executive shall be entitled to terminate her employment with the Company by providing the Company with at least thirty (30) days  advance written notice of such decision.

Good Reason   means the occurrence of any of the following events: 

(A)           A material diminution in the Executive s duties or authority inconsistent with the Executive s position (including status, offices, titles and reporting requirements), excluding an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith that is remedied by the Company after receipt of notice thereof given by the Executive: 

(B)            A material reduction in the Executive s Base Salary or target bonus percentage; or 

4 

(C)            Any action or inaction by the Company that constitutes a material breach of the terms and provisions of this Agreement (and its Exhibits). 

(ii)         Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Executive s employment shall not be terminated for Good Reason unless she provides written notice to the Company stating the basis of such termination and the Company fails to cure the action or inaction that is the basis for the termination for Good Reason within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice. 

8.            Compensation Upon Termination of Employment  . 

(a)            Termination by Reason of Death, Disability, for Cause or by the Executive  .  Subject to   Section 8(c)   below, if the Executive s employment is terminated pursuant to   Section 7(a), 7(b), 7(c) or 7(d)   above, then the Company shall pay to the Executive (or her estate, as appropriate), within 30 days of her termination date:

(b)           Other Termination  .  If the Executive s employment is terminated pursuant to   Section 7(e) or 7(f)   above, but not under the circumstances contemplated by   Section 8(c)   below, then the Company shall pay to the Executive, within 60 days of her termination date (but in all cases subject to   Section 8(d)   below and not before the applicable general release becoming effective in accordance with its terms), the following amounts and benefits: 

(i)        A cash lump sum amount equal to twelve (12) months of her then current annual Base Salary on the effective date of termination, ignoring any decrease in Base Salary that forms the basis for Good Reason.

(ii)         An amount equal to a pro-rata portion of the bonus to which the Executive otherwise might have been entitled pursuant to   Section 6(b)   above, assuming for such purposes that the Executive would have received a bonus for that year equal to her Target Bonus if she had stayed employed with the Company for the entire year. 

5 

(iii)      If Executive timely elects continued coverage under COBRA for herself and her covered dependents under the Company s group health plans following such termination employment, then the Company will pay the COBRA premiums necessary to continue the Executive s health insurance coverage in effect for herself and her eligible dependents on the termination date, as and when due to the insurance carrier or COBRA administrator (as applicable), through the earlier to occur of the expiration of the nine-month (9-month) period following her termination date or the expiration of Executive s eligibility for the continuation coverage under COBRA.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company determines, in its sole discretion, that the payment of the COBRA premiums would result in a violation of the nondiscrimination rules of Section 105(h)(2) of the Code or any statute or regulation of similar effect (including but not limited to the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the 2010 Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act), then in lieu of providing the COBRA premiums, the Company, in its sole discretion, may elect instead to pay Executive on the first day of each month of the nine-month period, a fully taxable cash payment equal to such portion of the COBRA premiums for that month, subject to applicable tax withholdings (such amount, the   Special Severance Payment  ).  Executive may, but is not obligated to, use such Special Severance Payment toward the cost of COBRA premiums.  The first Special Severance Payment will occur on the date that is thirty days following the date of Executive s termination from employment, subject to the effectiveness of the general release as set forth in Section 8(d), and subsequent payments will occur on the schedule described above. If the Executive becomes eligible for coverage under another employer s group health plan or otherwise cease to be eligible for COBRA during the period provided in this clause, the Executive must immediately notify the Company of such event, and all payments and obligations under this clause will cease.

(iv)      All of the Executive s then-outstanding Stock Options will be subject to accelerated vesting, and (if applicable) become immediately exercisable, with respect to the number of shares as to which the Stock Options that otherwise would have vested in the nine-month (9-month) period following the Executive s termination date.

(v)       The Company will extend the post-termination exercise period applicable to the Executive s then-outstanding Stock Options until the earliest to occur of (i) nine (9) months following her termination date, and (ii) the original term of the Stock Options.

(c)           Change of Control  . 

(i)          If the Executive s employment is terminated by the Company without Cause (and not as a result of death or a Disability) or by the Executive for Good Reason and such termination date falls within the one-year (1-year) period immediately following a Change of Control (as defined in the Company s Stock Option Plan as in effect on the date hereof) (a   Change of Control Termination  ), then the Company shall pay to the Executive, within 60 days of her termination date (but in all cases subject to   Section 8(d)   below and not before the applicable general release becoming effective in accordance with its terms), the following amounts: 

6 

(A)         A cash lump sum amount equal to eighteen (18) months of her then current annual Base Salary on the effective date of termination, ignoring any decrease in Base Salary that forms the basis for Good Reason; and

(B)          An amount equal to the bonus to which the Executive otherwise would have been entitled pursuant to Section 6(b) above, assuming for such purposes that the Executive would have received a bonus for that fiscal year equal to the Target Bonus if she had stayed employed with the Company for the entire year; and

(ii)       Following the Change of Control Termination, if Executive timely elects continued coverage under COBRA for herself and her covered dependents under the Company s group health plans following such termination employment, then the Company will pay the COBRA premiums necessary to continue the Executive s health insurance coverage in effect for herself and her eligible dependents on the termination date, as and when due to the insurance carrier or COBRA administrator (as applicable), through the earlier to occur of the expiration of the eighteen-month period following her termination date or the expiration of Executive s eligibility for the continuation coverage under COBRA.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company determines, in its sole discretion, that the payment of the COBRA premiums would result in a violation of the nondiscrimination rules of Section 105(h)(2) of the Code or any statute or regulation of similar effect (including but not limited to the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the 2010 Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act), then in lieu of providing the COBRA premiums, the Company, in its sole discretion, may elect instead to pay Executive on the first day of each month of the eighteen-month period, the Special Severance Payment.  Executive may, but is not obligated to, use such Special Severance Payment toward the cost of COBRA premiums.  If the Executive becomes eligible for coverage under another employer s group health plan or otherwise cease to be eligible for COBRA during the period provided in this clause, the Executive must immediately notify the Company of such event, and all payments and obligations under this clause will cease.

(iii)        Immediately prior to a Change of Control, all options, restricted stock and other equity-based awards granted to the Executive by the Company and held by her immediately prior to such a Change of Control shall become immediately and fully vested and, in the case of Stock Options, shall remain exercisable for their respective original terms. 

(d)            Release Required; Certain Limitations on the Company s Obligations Hereunder  .  The obligations of the Company to the Executive under this Section 8 shall be subject to the Executive s execution of a general release in favor of the Company, in the form of   Exhibit A   hereto or in such other form reasonably satisfactory to the Company, within sixty (60) days of Executive s termination of employment and all revocation periods applicable to such general release having expired without the release having been revoked prior to such sixtieth (60 th ) day.  Other than as expressly set forth in this   Section 8  , the Company shall have no payment or other obligations to the Executive following a termination of her employment by the Company.

Upon the termination of the Executive s employment with the Company (whether upon the expiration of the Term or thereafter), or at any time during such employment upon request by the Board, the Executive will promptly deliver to the Board (or its representative) and not keep in her possession, recreate or deliver to any other person or entity, any and all property that belongs to the Company and/or its subsidiaries, or that belongs to any other third party and is in the Executive s possession as a result of her employment with the Company, including without limitation, computer hardware and software, pagers, PDA s, cell phones, other electronic equipment, records, data, client lists and information, supplier lists and information, notes, reports, correspondence, financial information, account information, product information, files, electronically-stored information and other documents and information, including any and all copies of the foregoing.

The Executive hereby acknowledges and agrees that she has made no invention, original work of authorship, development, improvement, and trade secret prior to the commencement of her employment with the Company, that belong solely to the Executive or belong to the Executive jointly with others (subject to the restriction in   Section 9(b)  )(collectively referred to as   Prior Inventions  )), that relate in any way to any of the Company s and/or its subsidiaries  actual or proposed businesses, products, services or research and development, and that are not assigned to the Company and/or its subsidiaries herein).  If in the course of the Executive s employment with the Company (whether during the Term or thereafter), she incorporates into any Company s or its subsidiaries  products, processes, services or machines, a Prior Invention owned by the Executive or in which she has an interest, then the Company is hereby granted and shall have a non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide license (with the right to sublicense) to make, have made, copy, modify, make derivative works of, use, sell and otherwise distribute such Prior Invention as part of, or in connection with, such product, process, service or machine. 

(b)           Assignment of Inventions  .  The Executive will promptly make full written disclosure to the Board, will hold in trust for the sole right and benefit of the Company, and hereby assigns to the Company or its designee, all her right, title and interest throughout the world in and to any and all inventions, original works of authorship, developments, concepts, know-how, improvements or trade secrets, whether or not patentable or registrable under copyright or similar laws, that she may solely or jointly conceive or develop or reduce to practice, or cause to be developed or reduced to practice, during her employment with the Company (whether during the Term or thereafter) that (i) relate at the time of conception, development or reduction to practice to the actual or demonstrably proposed business or research and development activities of the Company and/or its subsidiaries, (ii) result from or relate to any work performed for the Company and/or its subsidiaries, whether or not during normal business hours or (iii) are developed through the use of Confidential Information (collectively referred to as   Inventions  ).  The Executive further acknowledges that all Inventions that are made by her (solely or jointly with others) within the scope of and during the period of her employment with the Company and/or its subsidiaries (whether during the Term or thereafter) are  works made for hire  (to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law) and are compensated by her salary, unless regulated otherwise by law. 

9 

(c)            Maintenance of Invention Records  .  The Executive will keep and maintain adequate and current written records of all Inventions made by her (solely or jointly with others) during her employment with the Company and/or its subsidiaries (whether during the Term or thereafter).  The records may be in the form of notes, sketches, drawings, flow charts, electronic data or recordings, laboratory notebooks or any similar format.  The records will be available to and remain the sole property of the Company and its subsidiaries at all times.  The Executive will not remove such records from the Company s or its subsidiaries  business premises except as expressly permitted by Company policy that may, from time to time, be revised at the sole discretion of the Company. 

(d)            Further Assistance  .  The Executive will assist the Company or its designee, at the Company s expense, in every way to secure the Company s rights in any Inventions and any copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, moral rights or other intellectual property rights relating thereto in any and all countries, including without limitation, the disclosure to the Company of all pertinent information and data with respect thereto, the execution of all applications, specifications, oaths, assignments, records and all other instruments that the Company shall deem necessary in order to apply for, obtain, maintain and transfer such rights and in order to assign and convey to the Company, its successors, assigns and nominees the sole and exclusive rights, title and interest in and to such Inventions, and any copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, moral rights or other intellectual property rights relating thereto.  The Executive acknowledges that her obligation to execute, or cause to be executed, when it is in her power to do so, any such instrument or papers shall continue after the termination of her employment with the Company until the expiration of the last such intellectual property right in any country.  If the Company is unable, after reasonable effort, because of the Executive s mental or physical incapacity or unavailability for any other reason, to secure her signature to apply for or to pursue any application for any patents or copyright registrations covering Inventions assigned to the Company above, then the Executive hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as her agent and attorney in fact, to act for and in her behalf and stead to execute and file any such applications and to do all other lawfully-permitted acts to further the application for, prosecution, issuance, maintenance or transfer of letters patent or copyright registrations thereon with the same legal force and effect as if originally executed by the Executive.  The Executive hereby waives and irrevocably quitclaims to the Company and/or its subsidiaries any and all claims, of any nature whatsoever, that she now or hereafter has for infringement of any and all Inventions assigned to the Company and/or its subsidiaries. 

12.          No Prior Restrictions   .   The Executive represents and warrants that her employment with the Company will not violate, or cause her to be in breach of, any obligation or covenant made to any former employer or other third party, and that during the course of her employment with the Company (whether during the Term or thereafter), she will not take any action that would violate or breach any legal obligation that she may have to any former employer or other third party. 

10 

13.          No Interference with Executives and Customers   .   The Executive agrees that, during the Executive s employment with the Company and for a period of twelve (12) months immediately thereafter, the Executive will not, directly or indirectly through another entity, for herself or any other person or entity, (i) induce or solicit, or attempt to induce or solicit, any executive or independent contractor of the Company or its subsidiaries (or any individual who was employed or engaged by the Company or its subsidiaries during the one-year period immediately before the termination of the Executive s employment) to leave the employment of, or to cease his or her contracting relationship with, the Company or its subsidiaries, (ii) interfere in any way with the employment relationship between the Company or its subsidiaries or their executives and independent contractors, (iii) hire or engage any executive or independent contractor of the Company or its subsidiaries (or any individual who was employed or engaged by the Company or its subsidiaries during the one-year period immediately before the termination of the Executive s employment) or (iv) induce or attempt to induce any customer, supplier, licensee or other business relation of the Company or its subsidiaries to cease doing business with the Company or its subsidiaries, or in any way interfere with the relationship between any such customer, supplier, licensee or business relation and the Company or its subsidiaries. 

14.          Non-Disparagement   .   Both during and after the Executive s employment with the Company, the Executive agrees not to disparage, portray in a negative light, or take any action that would be harmful to, or lead to unfavorable publicity for, the Company or any of its current or former clients, suppliers, officers, directors, Executives, agents, consultants, contractors, owners, parents, subsidiaries or divisions, whether in public or private, including without limitation, in any and all interviews, oral statements, written materials, electronically-displayed materials and materials or information displayed on Internet-related sites. 

15.          Equitable Relief  .  The Executive acknowledges that the remedy at law for her breach of   Sections 9  ,   10  ,   11  ,   13   and   14   above will be inadequate, and that the damages flowing from such breach will not be readily susceptible to being measured in monetary terms.  Accordingly, upon a violation of any part of such sections, the Company shall be entitled to immediate injunctive relief (or other equitable relief) and may obtain a temporary order restraining any further violation.  No bond or other security shall be required in obtaining such equitable relief, and the Executive hereby consents to the issuance of such equitable relief.  Nothing in this   Section 15   shall be deemed to limit the Company s remedies at law or in equity for any breach by the Executive of any of the parts of   Sections 9  ,   10  ,   11  ,   13   and   14   above which may be pursued or availed of by the Company. 

11 

16.          Judicial Modification   .   The Executive acknowledges that it is the intent of the parties hereto that the restrictions contained or referenced in   Sections 9  ,   10  ,   11  ,   13   and   14   above be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws of each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought.  If any of the restrictions contained or referenced in such Sections is for any reason held by an arbitrator or court to be excessively broad as to duration, activity, geographical scope or subject, then such restriction shall be construed, judicially modified or  blue penciled  in such jurisdiction so as to thereafter be limited or reduced to the extent required to be enforceable in such jurisdiction under applicable law. 

17.          Arbitration   .   Other than actions seeking injunctive relief to enforce the provisions of   Sections 9  ,   10  ,   11  ,   13   and   14   above (which actions may be brought by the Company in a court of appropriate jurisdiction), any dispute or controversy between the parties hereto, whether during the Term or thereafter, including without limitation, matters relating to this Agreement, the Executive s employment with the Company and the cessation thereof, and all matters arising under any federal, state or local statute, rule or regulation or principle of contract law or common law, including but not limited to any and all medical leave statutes, wage-payment statutes, employment discrimination statutes and any other equivalent federal, state or local statute, shall be settled by arbitration administered by JAMS in Washington, D.C. pursuant to its rules applicable to employment disputes, which arbitration shall be confidential, final and binding to the fullest extent permitted by law.  Each party hereto shall be responsible for paying one-half of the cost of the arbitration (including the cost of the arbitrator), and all of the cost of its own attorneys  fees and costs, unless otherwise apportioned by the arbitrator in accordance with applicable law 

18.          Notices   .   All notices and other communications provided for in this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered and received by the other party, or when sent by recognized overnight courier to the following addresses:

12 

19.          Severability   .   In the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement, or the application of any such provisions to the Executive or the Company with respect to obligations hereunder, is held to be unlawful or unenforceable by any court or arbitrator, the remaining portions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be invalidated or impaired in any manner. 

20.          Waiver   .   No waiver by any party hereto of the breach of any term or covenant contained in this Agreement, whether by conduct or otherwise, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be, or construed as, a further or continuing waiver of any such breach, or a waiver of any other term or covenant contained in this Agreement. 

21.          Entire Agreement   .   This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the Executive and the Company with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, and supersedes any and all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, between the Executive and the Company with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. 

22.          Amendments   .   This Agreement may be amended only by an agreement in writing signed by the Executive and an authorized representative of the Company (other than the Executive). 

23.         Section 409A Provisions  

(a)        Separation from Service. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that any severance payments or benefits paid or provided to Executive, if any, under this Agreement are considered deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and the final regulations and any guidance promulgated thereunder (  Section 409A  ) (such payments, the   Deferred Payments  ), then (i) to the extent required by Section 409A, no Deferred Payments will be payable unless Executive s termination of employment also constitutes a  separation from service,  as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(h) (without regard to any alternative definition thereunder) (a  Separation from Service ). Similarly, no Deferred Payments payable to Executive, if any, under this Agreement that otherwise would be exempt from Section 409A pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(9) will be payable until Executive has a Separation from Service. For clarity, if Executive terminates employment with the Company in a manner entitling Executive to severance payments and benefits under Section 8, but does not incur a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A, then any severance payments or benefits that are Deferred Payments and that are not immediately payable under this Section 23(a) will instead be paid to Executive when Executive incurs a Separation from Service, notwithstanding that Executive may no longer be employed under this Agreement.  For purposes of Section 409A (including, without limitation, for purposes of Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii)), Executive s right to receive the payments under this Agreement, including the severance payments and benefits, will be treated as a right to receive a series of separate payments and, accordingly, each installment payment will at all times be considered a separate and distinct payment.

13 

(b)            Six-Month Wait for Key Executives Following Separation from Service  .  To the extent that any amount payable or benefit to be provided under this Agreement or any other agreement between the parties hereto constitutes an amount payable or benefit to be provided under a  nonqualified deferred compensation plan  (as defined in Section 409A) upon a  separation from service  (as defined in Section 409A), including any amount payable under Section 8 above, and to the extent that the Executive is deemed to be a  specified employee  (as that term is defined in Section 409A and pursuant to procedures established by the Company) on the  separation from service  date, then, notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement or any other agreement to the contrary, such payment or benefit provision will not be made to the Executive during the six-month period immediately following the Executive s  separation from service  date.  Instead, on the first day of the seventh month following such  separation from service  date, all amounts that otherwise would have been paid or provided to the Executive during that six-month period, but were not paid or provided because of this Section 23(a), will be paid or provided to the Executive at such time, with any cash payment to be made in a single lump sum (without any interest with respect to that six-month period).  This six-month delay will cease to be applicable if the Executive  separates from service  due to death or if the Executive dies before the six-month period has elapsed. 

(c)            Section 409A Compliance;     Exceptions to Payment    Delay      .   To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, amounts payable to Executive under Section 8 will be made in reliance upon Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) (with respect to short-term deferrals) or Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(9) (with respect to separation pay plans). Accordingly, the severance payments provided for in Section 8 are not intended to provide for any deferral of compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code to the extent (i) the severance payments payable under Section 8, by its terms and determined as of the date of Executive s Separation from Service, may not be made later than the 15th day of the third calendar month following the later of (1) the end of the Company s fiscal year in which Executive s termination of employment occurs or (2) the end of the calendar year in which Executive s termination of employment occurs, or (ii) the severance payments do not exceed an amount equal to two times the lesser of (1) the amount of Executive s annualized compensation based upon Executive s annual rate of pay for the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which Executive s termination of employment occurs (adjusted for any increase during the calendar year in which such termination of employment occurs that would be expected to continue indefinitely had Executive remained employed with the Company) or (2) the maximum amount that may be taken into account under a qualified plan under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code for the calendar year in which Executive s termination of employment occurs. To the extent the payments and benefits under this Agreement are subject to Section 409A, this Agreement will be interpreted, construed and administered in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Sections 409A(a)(2), (3) and (4) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations and official guidance thereunder. If said payments and benefits to Executive are not exempt from or in compliance with Section 409A, the parties will attempt to bring such payments and benefits into compliance with Section 409A without diminishing the benefits to which Executive is entitled to the greatest extent possible.  

14 

(d)          Expense Reimbursement.     If required for compliance with Section 409A of the Code, any business expenses incurred by Executive that are reimbursed by the Company as a non-taxable reimbursement under this Agreement will be paid in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv) and in accordance with the Company s standard expense reimbursement policies, but in any event on or before the last day of Executive s taxable year following the taxable year in which Executive incurred the expenses. The amounts reimbursed during any taxable year of Executive will not affect the amounts provided in any other taxable year of Executive, and Executive s right to reimbursement for these amounts will not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit.

(e)          Timing of Release.    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if the sixty-day (60-day) consideration period set forth in Section 8(d) would span two calendar years, any payments specified as commencing within sixty (60) days of Executive s termination of employment shall commence in the next calendar year, with the first payment to include all payments that would have been made but for the provisions of this Section 23(e).

24.          Successors and Assigns   .   Because the Executive s obligations under this Agreement are personal in nature, the Executive s obligations may only be performed by the Executive and may not be assigned by her.  This Agreement is also binding upon the Executive s successors, heirs, executors, administrators and other legal representatives, and shall inure to the benefit of the Company and its subsidiaries, successors and assigns. 

25.          Consultation with Counsel   .   The Executive acknowledges that she has had a full and complete opportunity to consult with counsel of her own choosing concerning the terms, enforceability and implications of this Agreement. 

26.          No Other Representations   .   The Executive acknowledges that the Company has made no representations or warranties to the Executive concerning the terms, enforceability or implications of this Agreement other than as reflected in this Agreement. 

27.          Headings   .   The titles and headings of sections and subsections contained in this Agreement are included solely for convenience of reference and will not control the meaning or interpretation of any of the provisions of this Agreement. 

15 

28.          Counterparts   .   This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, and such counterparts shall together constitute but one agreement. 

29.          Governing Law  .  This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Maryland, without giving effect to its conflict of laws principles.
