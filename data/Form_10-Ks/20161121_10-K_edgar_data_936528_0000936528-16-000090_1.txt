Item 1. 
    Business  
       
  General  
  Washington Federal, Inc., formed in November 1994, is a Washington corporation headquartered in Seattle, Washington. The Company is a bank holding company that conducts its operations through a federally-insured national bank subsidiary, Washington Federal, National Association ( Bank ). As used throughout this document, the terms  Washington Federal  or the  Company  refer to Washington Federal, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries and the term "Bank" refers to the operating subsidiary Washington Federal, National Association.  
  The Company's fiscal year end is September 30th. All references to   2016  ,   2015   and   2014   represent balances as of   September 30, 2016  ,   September 30, 2015   and   September 30, 2014  , respectively, or activity for the fiscal years then ended.  
  The business of the Bank consists primarily of accepting deposits from the general public and investing these funds in loans of various types, including first lien mortgages on single-family dwellings, construction loans, land acquisition and development loans, loans on multi-family, commercial real estate and other income producing properties, home equity loans and business loans. It also invests in certain United States government and agency obligations and other investments permitted by applicable laws and regulations. As of   September 30, 2016  , Washington Federal has   238   branches located in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas. Through its subsidiaries, the Company is also engaged in real estate investment and insurance brokerage activities.  
    
  The principal sources of funds for the Company's activities are retained earnings, loan repayments, net deposit inflows, repayments and sales of investments and borrowings. Washington Federal's principal sources of revenue are interest on loans and interest and dividends on investments. Its principal expenses are interest paid on deposits, credit costs, general and administrative expenses, interest on borrowings and income taxes.  
    
  The Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC"), its primary federal regulator, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB") and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), which insures its deposits up to applicable limits. Washington Federal, as a bank holding company, is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (" Federal Reserve").  The CFPB  has broad authority to regulate providers of credit, payments and other consumer financial products and services and to bring actions to enforce federal consumer protection legislation as necessary. 
    
  The regulatory structure gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities. Any change in such regulation, whether by the OCC, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, the CFPB or the U.S. Congress, could have a significant impact on the Company and its operations. See  Regulation  section below.

Lending Activities

     Table of Contents  

General.   The Company's net portfolio of loans totaled   $9.9 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and represents   66.6%   of total assets. The Bank's lending activities include the origination of loans secured by real estate, including long-term fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans, adjustable-rate construction loans, adjustable-rate land development loans, fixed-rate and adjustable-rate multi-family loans, fixed-rate and adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans and fixed-rate and adjustable-rate business loans.    
    
  The following table sets forth the composition of the Bank s loan portfolio.

Table of Contents  

The following table summarizes the Company s loan portfolio, due for the periods indicated based on contractual terms to maturity or repricing. Amounts are presented prior to deduction of net discounts and premiums, loans in process, deferred net loan origination fees and costs and allowance for loan losses. 

The contractual loan payment period for residential mortgage loans originated by the Company normally ranges from 15 to 30 years. Experience during recent years has indicated that, because of prepayments in connection with refinancing and sales of property, residential loans have a weighted average life of four to ten years. 
    
  The following summary breaks down the Company's fixed rate and adjustable rate loans by time to maturity or to rate adjustment. 

Lending Programs and Policies.   The Bank's lending activities include the commercial and consumer loans, including the following loan categories.  
  Single-family residential loans  . The Bank primarily originates 30 year fixed-rate mortgage loans secured by single-family residences.  Moreover, it is the Bank's general policy to include in the documentation evidencing its conventional mortgage loans a due-on-sale clause, which facilitates adjustment of interest rates on such loans when the property securing the loan is sold or transferred.  
  All of the Bank's mortgage lending is subject to written, nondiscriminatory underwriting standards, loan origination procedures and lending policies approved by the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board"). Property valuations are required on all real estate loans. Appraisals are prepared by independent appraisers, reviewed by staff of the Bank, and approved by the Bank's management. Property evaluations are sometimes utilized in lieu of appraisals on single-family real estate loans of $250,000 or less and are reviewed by the Bank's staff. Detailed loan applications are obtained to determine the borrower's ability to repay and the more significant items on these applications are verified through the use of credit reports, financial statements or written confirmations.

     Table of Contents  

Depending on the size of the loan involved, a varying number of officers of the Bank must approve the loan application before the loan can be granted. Federal guidelines limit the amount of a real estate loan made to a specified percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, as determined by an evaluation at the time the loan is originated.  This is referred to as the loan-to-value ratio.  The Board sets the maximum loan-to-value ratios for each type of real estate loan offered by the Bank.  
  When establishing general reserves for loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 80% that are not insured by private mortgage insurance, the Bank considers the additional risk inherent in these products, as well as their relative loan loss experience, and provides reserves when deemed appropriate. The total balance for loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 80% at origination as of    September 30, 2016  , was $477 million, with allocated reserves of $9.8 million.  
  Construction loans  . The Bank originates construction loans to finance construction of single-family and multi-family residences as well as commercial properties. Loans made to builders are generally tied to an interest rate index and normally have maturities of two years or less. Loans made to individuals for construction of their home generally are 30 year fixed rate loans. The Bank's policies provide that for residential construction loans, loans may be made for 85% or less of the appraised value of the property upon completion.   As a result of activity over the past four decades, the Bank believes that builders of single-family residences in its primary market areas consider it to be a construction lender of choice.  Because of this history, the Bank has developed a staff with in-depth land development and construction experience and working relationships with selected builders based on their operating histories and financial stability.  
  Construction lending involves a higher level of risk than single-family residential lending due to the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers and the effects of general economic conditions in the homebuilding industry.  Moreover, a construction loan can involve additional risks because of the inherent difficulty in estimating both the estimated cost (including interest) of the project and the property's value at completion of the project.  
  Land loans  . The Bank's land development loans are of a short-term nature and are generally made for 75% or less of the appraised value of the unimproved property. Funds are disbursed periodically at various stages of completion as authorized by the Company's personnel. The interest rate on these loans generally adjusts daily in accordance with a designated index.  
  Land development loans involve a higher degree of credit risk than long-term financing on owner-occupied real estate. Mitigation of risk of loss on a land development loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property's value at completion of development compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of development and the financial strength of the borrower.  
  The Bank's permanent land loans (also called consumer lot loans) are generally made on improved land, with the intent of building a primary or secondary residence. These loans are limited to 80% or less of the appraised value of the property, up to a maximum loan amount of $350,000. The interest rate on permanent land loans is generally fixed for 20 years.  
  Multi-family residential loans  . Multi-family residential (five or more dwelling units) loans generally are secured by multi-family rental properties, such as apartment buildings. In underwriting multi-family residential loans, the Bank considers a number of factors, which include the projected net cash flow to the loan's debt service requirement, the age and condition of the collateral, the financial resources and income level of the borrower and the borrower's experience in owning or managing similar properties. Multi-family residential loans are originated in amounts up to 80% of the appraised value of the property securing the loan.  
  Loans secured by multi-family residential real estate generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than single-family residential loans and carry larger loan balances. This increased credit risk is a result of several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the effects of general economic conditions on income-producing properties, and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. Furthermore, the repayment of loans secured by multi-family mortgages typically depends upon the successful operation of the related real estate property. If the cash flow from the project is reduced, the borrower's ability to repay the loan may be impaired. The Bank seeks to minimize these risks through its underwriting policies, which require such loans to be qualified at origination on the basis of the property's income and debt service ratio.   
  It is the Bank's policy to obtain title insurance ensuring that it has a valid first lien on the mortgaged real estate serving as collateral for the loan. Borrowers must also obtain hazard insurance prior to closing and, when required by regulation, flood insurance. Borrowers may be required to advance funds on a monthly basis, together with each payment of principal and interest, to a mortgage escrow account from which the Bank makes disbursements for items such as real estate taxes, hazard insurance premiums and private mortgage insurance premiums when due.  
  Commercial and industrial loans  . The Bank makes various types of  business loans to customers in its market area for working capital, acquiring real estate, equipment or other business purposes, such as acquisitions. The terms of these loans generally range from less than one year to a maximum of ten years. The loans are either negotiated on a fixed-rate basis or carry adjustable interest rates indexed to the LIBOR rate, prime rate or another market rate.

     Table of Contents  

Commercial loans are made based upon assessment of the borrower's ability and willingness to repay along with an evaluation of secondary repayment sources such as the value and marketability of collateral. Most such loans are extended to closely held businesses and the personal guaranty of the principals is usually obtained. Commercial loans have a relatively high risk of default compared to residential real estate loans. Pricing of commercial loans is based on the credit risk of the borrower with consideration given to the overall relationship of the borrower, including deposits.  The acquisition of business deposits is an important focus of this business line.  The Bank provides a full line of treasury management products to support the depository needs of its clients. 
    
  Consumer loans  .  The Bank's non-mortgage consumer loan portfolio consists of approximately $118.4 million prime quality student loans acquired from an independent financial investment firm that retains 1% of each loan, plus various other non-mortgage consumer loans obtained through acquisitions.  
    
  Home equity loans  .  The Bank extends revolving lines of credit to consumers that are secured by a first or second mortgage on a single family residence.  The interest rate on these loans adjusts monthly indexed to prime. Total loan-to-value ratios when combined with any underlying first liens are limited to 80% or less.  Loan terms are a ten year draw period followed by a fifteen year amortization period. 
  Origination and Purchase of Loans.   The Bank has general authority to lend anywhere in the United States; however, its primary lending areas are within the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas.  Loan originations come from a variety of sources. Residential loan originations result from referrals from real estate brokers, walk-in customers, purchasers of property in connection with builder projects that are financed by the Bank, mortgage brokers and refinancings for existing customers. Business purpose loans are obtained primarily by direct solicitation of borrowers and ongoing relationships. 
    
  The Bank also purchases loans and mortgage-backed securities when lending rates and mortgage volume for new loan originations in its market area do not fulfill its needs.  Over the past few years, single-family residential loan originations were lower than historical levels due to the low interest rate environment and excessive government participation in the mortgage market.     
    
  The table below shows the Company's total loan origination, purchase and repayment activities.

Interest Rates, Loan Fees and Service Charges.   Interest rates charged by the Bank on mortgage loans are primarily determined by the competitive loan rates offered in its lending areas and in the secondary market. Mortgage loan rates reflect factors such as general interest rates, the supply of money available to the industry and the demand for such loans. General economic conditions, the regulatory programs and policies of federal and state agencies, including the FRB s monetary policies, changes in tax laws and governmental budgetary programs influence these factors. 
  The Bank receives fees for originating loans in addition to various fees and charges related to existing loans, including prepayment charges, late charges and assumption fees.  In making one-to-four- family home mortgage loans, the Bank normally charges an origination fee and as part of the loan application, the borrower pays the Bank for out-of-pocket costs, such as the appraisal fee, whether or not the borrower closes the loan. The interest rate charged is normally the prevailing rate at the time the loan application is approved and accepted. In the case of construction loans, the Bank normally charges an origination fee. Loan origination fees and other terms of multi-family residential loans are individually negotiated. 
  Non-Performing Assets.   When a borrower violates a condition of a loan, the Bank attempts to cure the default by contacting the borrower.  In most cases, defaults are cured promptly.  If the default is not cured within an appropriate time frame, typically 90 days, the Bank may institute appropriate action to collect the loan, such as making demand for payment or initiating foreclosure proceedings on the collateral. If foreclosure occurs, the collateral will typically be sold at public auction and may be purchased by the Bank.  
  Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in the judgment of management, the probability of collecting interest or principal is deemed to be insufficient to warrant further accrual. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, previously accrued but unpaid interest is deducted from interest income. The Bank does not accrue interest on loans 90 days past due or more. See Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof for additional information. 
  The Bank will consider modifying the interest rate and terms of a loan if it determines that a modification is deemed to be the best option available for collection in full or to minimize the loss to the Bank.  Most loans restructured in troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs") are accruing and performing loans where the borrower has proactively approached the Bank about a modification due to temporary financial difficulties.  Each request is individually evaluated for merit and likelihood of success.  The modification of these loans is typically a payment reduction through a rate reduction of from 100 to 200 bps for a specific term, usually six to twelve  months. Interest-only payments may also be approved during the modification period.  Principal forgiveness generally is not an available option for restructured loans.  As of   September 30, 2016  , single-family residential loans comprised   87.2%   of restructured loans.  The Bank reserves for restructured loans within its allowance for loan loss methodology by taking into account the following performance indicators:  1) time since modification, 2) current payment status and 3) geographic market conditions.  
  Real estate acquired by foreclosure or deed-in-lieu thereof ( REO  or  Real Estate Owned ) is classified as real estate held for sale. When property is acquired, it is recorded at the fair market value less estimated selling costs at the date of acquisition. Interest accrual ceases on the date of acquisition and all costs incurred in maintaining the property from that date forward are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred for the improvement or development of such property is capitalized. See Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof for additional information.

The following table sets forth information regarding the Company's restructured and non-accrual loans and REO. 

___________________ 
           (1) 
    For the year ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized   $5,434,000   in interest income on cash payments received from borrowers on non-accrual loans.  The Company would have recognized interest income of   $2,348,000   for the same period had these loans performed according to their original contract terms. The recognized interest income may include more than twelve months of interest for some of the non-accrual loans that were brought current or paid off.  In addition to the non-accrual loans reflected in the above table, the Company had   $117,536,000   of loans that were less than 90 days delinquent at   September 30, 2016   but were classified as substandard for one or more reasons.  If these loans were deemed non-performing, the Company's ratio of total non-performing assets and performing restructured loans as a percent of total assets would have increased to   2.96%   at   September 30, 2016  . For a discussion of the Company's policy for placing loans on nonaccrual status, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof.  

Allowance for Loan Losses.   The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The amount of this allowance is based on ongoing, quarterly assessments of the probable and estimable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The Bank s method for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance is to apply a loss percentage factor to the different loan types.  The loss percentage factor is made up of two parts - the historical loss factor ( HLF ) and the qualitative loss factor ( QLF ).  The HLF takes into account historical charge-offs by loan type.  The Company uses an average of historical loss rates for each loan category multiplied by an estimated loss emergence period.  The QLFs are based on management's continuing evaluation of the pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio, including changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio, actual loan loss experience, current economic conditions, collateral values, geographic concentrations, seasoning of the loan portfolio, specific industry conditions, and the duration of the current business cycle. These factors are considered by loan type.  Specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified conditions or circumstances related to a loan that management believes indicate the probability that a loss has been incurred.  The Company has also established a reserve for unfunded commitments.   
  As part of the process for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, management reviews the loan portfolio for specific weaknesses and considers the factors noted above.  The recovery of the carrying value of loans is susceptible to future market conditions

beyond the Bank's control, which may result in losses or recoveries differing from those provided.  In those cases, a portion of the allowance is then allocated to reflect the estimated loss exposure.  
  The following table provides detail regarding the Company's allowance for loan losses.

Investment Activities 
  As a national association, the Bank is obligated to maintain adequate liquidity and does so by holding cash and cash equivalents and by investing in securities. These investments may include, among other things, certain certificates of deposit, repurchase agreements, bankers  acceptances, loans to financial institutions whose deposits are federally-insured, federal funds, United States government and agency obligations and mortgage-backed securities. 
  The following table sets forth the composition of the Company s investment portfolio.    

The table below shows the investment portfolio categorized by maturity band.    

Sources of Funds 
    
  General.   Deposits are the primary source of the Bank s funds for use in lending and other general business purposes. In addition to deposits, the Bank derives funds from loan repayments, advances from the FHLB, other borrowings, and from investment repayments and sales. Loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows are influenced by general interest rates, money market conditions, the availability of FDIC insurance and the market perception of the Company s financial stability.  Borrowings may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in normal sources of funds, such as deposit inflows at lower than projected levels. Borrowings may also be used on a longer-term basis to support expanded activities and to manage interest rate risk. 
    
  Deposits.   The Bank relies on a mix of deposit types, including business and personal checking accounts, term certificates of deposit, and other savings deposit alternatives that have no fixed term, such as money market accounts and passbook savings accounts  The Bank offers several consumer checking account products, both interest bearing and non-interest bearing and three business checking accounts, two of which target small businesses with relatively simple and straightforward banking needs and one for larger, more complex business depositors with an account that prices monthly based on the volume and type of activity.  Savings and money market accounts are offered to both businesses and consumers, with interest paid after certain threshold amounts are exceeded. 
    
  Certificates of deposit with a maturity of one year or less have penalties for premature withdrawal equal to 90 days of interest. When the maturity is greater than one year but less than four years, the penalty is 180 days of interest. When the maturity is greater than four years, the penalty is 365 days interest. Early withdrawal penalty fee income for the year ended   2016  ,   2015   and   2014   amounted to   $450,000  ,   $546,000   and   $552,000  , respectively.

     Table of Contents  

The Bank s deposits are obtained primarily from residents of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas. The Bank does not advertise for deposits outside of these states. 
    
  The following table sets forth certain information relating to the Company s deposits. 

The following table sets forth, by various interest rate categories, the amount of fixed-rate time deposits that mature during the periods indicated. 

Historically, a significant number of certificate of deposit holders roll over their balances into new certificates of the same term at the Bank s then current rate. To ensure a continuity of this trend, the Bank expects to continue to offer market rates of interest. Its ability to retain maturing deposits in certificate accounts is difficult to project; however, the Bank believes that by competitively pricing these certificates, levels deemed appropriate by management can be achieved on a continuing basis.   
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had   $442,510,000   of certificates of deposit in amounts of $250,000 or more outstanding, maturing as follows:   $88,667,000   within 3 months;   $89,305,000   over 3 months through 6 months;   $97,485,000   over 6 months through 12 months; and   $167,053,000   thereafter.

Borrowings.   The Bank has a credit line with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines ("FHLB") equal to   49.0%   of total assets. The Bank obtains advances from the FHLB upon the security of the FHLB capital stock it owns and certain of its loans, provided certain standards related to credit worthiness have been met. See  Regulation-Washington Federal-Federal Home Loan Bank System  below. Such advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs. Each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities, and the FHLB prescribes acceptable uses to which the advances pursuant to each program may be put, as well as limitations on the size of such advances. Depending on the program, such limitations are based either on a fixed percentage of assets or the Company's credit worthiness. The FHLB is required to review its credit limitations and standards at least every two years. FHLB advances have, from time to time, been available to meet seasonal and other withdrawals of savings accounts and to expand the Bank's lending program. The Bank had   $2,080,000,000   of FHLB advances outstanding at   September 30, 2016  .  
  The Bank may need to borrow funds for short periods of time to meet day-to-day financing needs. In these instances, funds are borrowed from other financial institutions or the Federal Reserve, for periods generally ranging from one to seven days at the then current borrowing rate. At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had no such short-term borrowings.  
    
  The Bank also offers two forms of repurchase agreements to its customers. One form has an interest rate that floats like that of a money market deposit account. The other form has a fixed rate and is offered in a minimum denomination of $100,000. Both forms are fully collateralized by securities. These obligations are not insured by the FDIC and are classified as borrowings for regulatory purposes. The Bank had   $48,920,000   of such agreements outstanding at   September 30, 2016  .  
  The following table presents additional information regarding the Company's borrowings.

Rate/Volume Analysis 
    
  The table below sets forth certain information regarding changes in interest income and interest expense of the Company for the years indicated. For each category of interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability, information is provided on changes attributable to: (1) changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by old rate) and (2) changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by old average volume). The change in interest income and interest expense attributable to changes in both volume and rate has been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate.

    Includes interest on cash equivalents and dividends on stock of the FHLB of Des Moines and FRB of San Francisco. 
       
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  The primary source of income for the Company is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income generated by interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred for interest-bearing liabilities.  The level of net interest income is a function of the average balance of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the difference between the yield on earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.  Both the pricing and mix of the Company's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities influence these factors.  All else being equal, if the interest rates on the Company's interest-bearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on its interest-earning assets, the result would be a reduction in net interest income and with it, a reduction in net earnings.   
    
  The net interest margin is measured using the interest income and expense over the average assets and liabilities for the period. The net interest margin increased to   3.11%   for the year ended   September 30, 2016   from   3.08%   for the year ended   September 30, 2015  . The yield on earning assets increased 2 basis points to   3.97%   and the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined by 1 basis point to   0.93%  . The higher yield on earning assets is the result of changes in the asset mix as the average balance of mortgage-backed securities and other investment securities decreased while the average balance of loans receivable increased.  The decrease in interest cost was due to changes in the mix of customer deposits and FHLB advances.    
    
  Interest rate risk arises in part due to the Bank's significant holdings of fixed-rate single-family home loans, which are longer-term than customer accounts that constitute its primary liabilities.  Accordingly, assets do not usually respond as quickly to changes in interest rates as liabilities.  In the absence of management action, net interest income can be expected to decline when interest rates rise and to expand when interest rates fall.  Shortening the maturity or repricing of the investment portfolio is one action that management can take.  The composition of the investment portfolio was   39.7%   variable rate and   60.3%   fixed rate as of   September 30, 2016   to provide some protection against rising rates.  In addition, the Bank is producing more short term or variable rate loans and has increased less rate sensitive transaction accounts to   56.7%   of the deposit portfolio.

The Company's balance sheet strategy, in conjunction with low operating costs, has allowed the Company to manage interest rate risk, within guidelines established by the Board, through all interest rate cycles. It is management's objective to grow the dollar amount of net interest income, through the rate cycles, acknowledging that there will be some periods of time when that will not be feasible.   
    
  The chart below shows the volatility of the Company's period end net interest spread (dotted line which is measured against the right axis) compared to the relatively consistent growth in net interest income (solid line which is measured against the left axis).  As noted above, this consistency is accomplished by managing the size and composition of the balance sheet through different rate cycles. 

The following table shows the estimated repricing periods for earning assets and paying liabilities.  

(1)  Asset repricing period includes estimated prepayments based on historical activity 

At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had approximately   $1,503,542,000   more in liabilities subject to maturity or repricing in the next year than assets, which resulted in a one-year repricing gap of   (10.1)%   of total assets.  This compares to the   (13.4)%   gap as of   September 30, 2015  . A negative repricing gap implies that funding costs will change more rapidly than interest income on earning assets with movements in interest rates.  A negative repricing gap typically results in lower margins when interest rates rise and higher margins when interest rates decline.  The interest rate gap analysis provides management with a high-level indication of interest rate risk, but it is  
  
   17 

     Table of Contents  

considered less reliable than more detailed modeling. Cash and cash equivalents of   $450,368,000   and stockholders' equity of   $1,975,731,000   provide management with additional flexibility in managing interest rate risk going forward. If management were to take steps to change the size and/or mix of the balance sheet or slow the repricing of deposit rates upward, rising rates might not cause a decrease in net interest income.   
  The following table shows the potential impact of rising interest rates on net income for one year.  The Company's focus is primarily on the impact of rising rates, given the negative gap position which implies that generally when rates fall income should increase and when rates increase income is at risk to decrease (assuming no change in the size or composition of the balance sheet).   
  It is important to note that this is not a forecast or prediction of future events, but is used as a tool for measuring potential risk.  This analysis assumes zero balance sheet growth and a constant percentage composition of assets and liabilities.  

Actual results will differ from the assumptions used in this model, as management monitors and adjusts both the size and the composition of the balance sheet in order to respond to changing interest rates. In a rising interest rate environment, it is likely that the Company will grow its balance sheet to offset margin compression that may occur.  Improvement in the net income sensitivity during the year is the result of changing the loan and deposit mix toward shorter term and/or floating rate instruments. 
   Another method used to quantify interest rate risk is the net portfolio value ( NPV ) analysis. This analysis calculates the difference between the present value of interest-bearing liabilities and the present value of expected cash flows from interest-earning assets and off-balance-sheet contracts. The following tables set forth an analysis of the Company s interest rate risk as measured by the estimated changes in NPV resulting from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve (measured in 100-basis-point increments).      
   The tables below express the NPV under varying interest scenarios.

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all of its interest rate risk policy guidelines. 

Subsidiaries  
  Washington Federal is a bank holding company that conducts its primary business through its only directly-owned subsidiary, the Bank. The Bank has a national bank charter with the OCC.  The Bank has three active wholly owned subsidiaries, discussed further below.  
  WAFD Insurance Group, Inc. is incorporated under the laws of the state of Washington and is an insurance agency that offers a full line of individual and business insurance policies to customers of the Bank, as well as to the general public.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , WAFD Insurance Group, Inc. had total assets of   $12,206,000   and   $10,436,000  , respectively. 
  Statewide Mortgage Services Company is incorporated under the laws of the state of Washington. As of   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , Statewide Mortgage Services Company had total assets of   $1,376,000   and   $14,182,000  , respectively. The decrease in assets primarily relates to the sale-leaseback of a branch property in late   2016   that resulted in a gain of $3,800,000.  
  Washington Services, Inc. is incorporated under the laws of the state of Washington.  It holds certain branch properties and equipment and also acts as a trustee under deeds of trust as to which the Bank is beneficiary.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , Washington Services, Inc. had total assets of   $214,000  . 
  Employees  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had approximately   1,806   employees, including the full-time equivalent of 27 part-time employees and its service corporation employees. None of these employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement.  
  Regulation  
            Set forth below is a brief description of certain laws and regulations that relate to the regulation of the Company and the Bank. The description of these laws and regulations, and descriptions of laws and regulations contained elsewhere herein, do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the  Dodd-Frank Act ) amended certain federal banking laws.  

The Company  
    
  General.   The Company is registered as a bank holding company and is subject to regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements of the Federal Reserve.   
    
  Restrictions on Activities and Acquisitions.   Bank holding companies are subject to a variety of restrictions on their activities and the acquisitions they can make. Generally, the activities or acquisition of a bank holding company that is not a financial holding company are limited to those that constitute banking or managing or controlling banks or which are closely related to banking. In addition, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve, bank holding companies are generally prohibited from acquiring more than 5% of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company, taking any action that causes a bank to become a subsidiary of the bank holding company, acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of a bank, or merging with another bank holding company. 
    
  Control of Company or Bank.   Pursuant to the Change in Bank Control Act, (the  CIBC Act ) individuals, corporations or other entities acquiring Company equity interests may, alone or together with other investors, be deemed to control a holding company or a bank. If an acquisition is deemed to constitute control of the holding company or bank and is not subject to approval under the Bank Holding Company Act or certain other statutes, such person or group will be required to file a notice under the CIBC Act. Generally, ownership of, or power to vote, more than 25% of any class of voting securities constitutes control. In the case of a bank or bank holding company the securities of which are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), ownership of or power to vote more than 10% of any class of voting securities creates a presumption of control. 
    
  Source of Strength.   Under long-standing Federal Reserve policy, a bank holding company is expected to serve as a source of financial and management strength to its subsidiary bank.  Under this policy, a bank holding company is expected to stand ready to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary bank during periods of financial adversity and to maintain financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to assist its subsidiary bank.  The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength doctrine by adopting  
  
   19 

     Table of Contents  

a statutory provision requiring, among other things, that bank holding companies serve as a source of financial strength to their subsidiary banks.  
    
  Restrictions on Company Dividends.    The Company s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is affected by several factors.  Since the Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and its subsidiaries and does not have significant operations of its own, the Company may not be able to pay dividends to its shareholders if the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company.  The Bank s ability to pay dividends is subject to various regulatory restrictions.   
    
  See  Washington Federal, National Association, wholly owned subsidiary (Bank) - Restrictions on Dividends.   In addition, the Company s ability to pay dividends is subject to rules and policies of the Federal Reserve.  It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the company s expected future needs and financial condition.  New capital rules adopted by the Federal Reserve, effective in January 2015, may limit the Company s ability to pay dividends if the Company fails to meet certain requirements under the rules.   
    
  See  Washington Federal, National Association, wholly owned operating subsidiary (Bank) - Restrictions on Dividends.    
    
  Since the Company is a Washington state corporation, it is also subject to restrictions under Washington corporate law relating to dividends.  Generally under Washington law, a corporation may not pay a dividend if, after giving effect to the dividend, the corporation would be unable to pay its liabilities as they become due in the ordinary course of business or the corporation s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus (with some exceptions) the amount that would be needed, if the corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the dividend payment, to satisfy the dissolution preferences of senior equity securities.   

Washington Federal, National Association, wholly-owned operating subsidiary (Bank) 
    
  General.   The Bank is a federally-chartered national bank and certain deposits of the bank are federally insured and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. Accordingly, the Bank is subject to broad federal regulation and oversight by its primary regulator, the OCC, extending to all aspects of its operations.  The Bank is a member of the FDIC and its deposits are insured up to applicable limits of the Depository Insurance Fund ( DIF ), which is administered by the FDIC.  As a result, the FDIC has certain regulatory and examination authority over the Bank.   
    
  As a national bank, the Bank is required to be a member of the Federal Reserve. As a member, it is required to purchase and maintain stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco ( FRBSF ) in an amount equal to 3.00% of the paid-up capital stock and surplus of the Bank and have available another 3.00% in reserves. At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had $24.0 million in FRBSF stock, which was in compliance with this requirement. 
    
  Federal Institution Regulations.   On July 17, 2013, the Bank completed its conversion from a federally chartered savings association to a national bank charter with the OCC.  In addition, the Company became a bank holding company registered with the Federal Reserve.  The OCC has extensive authority over the operations of national banks. As part of this authority, national banks are required to file periodic reports with the OCC and are subject to periodic examinations by the OCC.  Federal laws and regulations prescribe the investment and lending authority of the Bank, and the Bank is prohibited from engaging in any activities not permitted by such laws and regulations. While the Bank has broad authority to engage in all types of lending activities, a variety of restrictions apply to certain other investments by the Bank.  
    
  Financial Modernization.    On July 21, 2010 the Dodd-Frank Act became effective.  This law has broadly affected the financial services industry by implementing changes to the financial regulatory landscape aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services industry, and will continue to significantly change the current bank regulatory structure and affect the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies, including the Company and the Bank.  Some of the changes that are significant to the Company and the Bank include:   
    
  The establishment of the CFPB, which on July 21, 2011 took over responsibility for the principal federal consumer protection laws, such as the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Truth in Saving Act, among others. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority in this area, and also has primary supervisory and examination authority on these issues over institutions such as the Bank with assets of $10 billion or more.  The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB expanded data collecting powers for fair lending purposes for both small business and mortgage loans, as well as expanded authority to prevent unfair, deceptive and abusive practices.  

20 

     Table of Contents  

On October 9, 2013, the CFPB entered a Consent Order against the Bank that required the Bank to pay a civil money penalty of $34,000, and to adopt an enhanced compliance program related to reporting Home Mortgage Disclosure Act ("HMDA") data.  The Bank has adopted an enhanced HMDA program, which continues to be subject to review by the CFPB.  The Bank believes it continues to be in compliance with all material terms of the Order. 
    
  As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve adopted a rule that restricted interchange fees applicable to debit card transactions.  Effective October 1, 2011, interchange fees on debit card transactions are limited to a maximum of 21 cents per transaction plus 5 basis points of the transaction amount. A debit card issuer may recover an additional one cent per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraud-related requirements prescribed by the Federal Reserve.  
    
  Interstate Banking  .  Subject to certain limitations and restrictions, a bank holding company, with prior approval of the Federal Reserve, may acquire an out-of-state bank; banks in states that do not prohibit out-of-state mergers may merge with the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency, and a bank may establish a de novo branch out of state if such branching is permitted by the other state for state banks chartered by such other state. 
    
  Insurance of Deposit Accounts.   Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the maximum amount of federal deposit insurance coverage was permanently increased from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor, per institution. Due to the significant number of bank failures and the current balance of the DIF, the Company anticipates continued elevated FDIC premiums for the industry going forward.  Continued credit quality improvements have lessened this increase for the Company.  The Dodd-Frank Act also broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act raised the minimum designated reserve ratio, which the FDIC is required to set each year for the DIF, to 1.35% and requires that the DIF meet that minimum ratio by September 30, 2020.  The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds.  The FDIC has established a higher reserve ratio of 2% as a long-term goal beyond what is required by statute.  
    
  All insured institutions are also required to pay quarterly assessments to the FDIC in order to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation ("FICO"), a federal agency that was established to recapitalize a predecessor to the DIF. These assessments will continue until the FICO bonds mature, which will be between 2017 and 2019. The FICO assessment rate is subject to quarterly adjustment. The current rate is 0.0056% of average consolidated total assets minus tangible equity. 
    
  Transactions with Affiliates; Insider Loans.   Under current federal law, all transactions between and among a national bank and its affiliates, including holding companies, are subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W promulgated thereunder. Generally, these requirements limit extensions of credit and certain other such transactions by the bank to affiliates to a percentage of the institution's capital and generally such transactions must be collateralized.  Generally, all affiliate transactions must be on terms at least as favorable to the bank as transactions with non-affiliates. In addition, a bank may not lend to any affiliate engaged in non-banking activities that are not permissible for a bank holding company or acquire shares of any affiliate that is not a subsidiary. The OCC is authorized to impose additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates if necessary to protect the safety and soundness of a national bank.  
    
  Extensions of credit by a national bank to executive officers, directors and principal shareholders are subject to Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act, which, among other things, generally prohibits loans to any such individual where the aggregate amount exceeds an amount equal to 15% of an institution's unimpaired capital and surplus plus an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus in the case of loans that are fully secured by readily marketable collateral. Section 22(h) permits loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to employees of a subject bank provided that no preference is given to any officer, director or principal stockholder, or related interest thereto, over any other employee. In addition, the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by a bank to all insiders cannot exceed the institution's unimpaired capital and surplus. Furthermore, Section 22(g) places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers.  
    
  Effective on July 21, 2012, the affiliate transaction rules in Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act were expanded to broaden the definition of affiliate and to apply these rules to securities lending, repurchase agreements and derivatives. These revisions also strengthened collateral requirements and limited Federal Reserve exemptive authority.  Further, the definition of  extension of credit  for transactions with executive officers, directors and principal shareholders was expanded to include credit exposure arising from a derivative transaction, a repurchase or reverse repurchase agreement or a securities lending or borrowing transaction.  These provisions have not had a material effect on the Company or the Bank. 
    
  Restrictions on Dividends.   OCC regulations govern dividends by a national bank. A national bank must file an application for approval of a dividend if:  
  
   21 

     Table of Contents  

the total dividends for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the institution's net income for that year to date plus the institution's retained net income for the preceding two years; 
     the institution would not be at least adequately capitalized following the dividend; 
     the dividend would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or OCC imposed condition; or 
     the dividend is paid in property other than cash or stock of the bank. 

Other capital distributions, such as stock repurchases, generally require the approval of the OCC.  Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may place certain restrictions on the payment of dividends and stock repurchases.    
    
  Federal Home Loan Bank System.   The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") of Des Moines, which is one of 11 regional FHLBs that provide funding to their members for making home mortgage loans, as well as loans for affordable housing and community development. Each FHLB serves members within its assigned region and is funded primarily through proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system.  Loans are made to members in accordance with the policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB. At   September 30, 2016  , FHLB advances to the Company amounted to   $2,080,000,000  .  As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of Des Moines.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had $93.2 million in FHLB of Des Moines stock, which was in compliance with this requirement.  
    
  Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws.    National banks have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA") and related regulations of the OCC to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act (together, the "Fair Lending Laws") prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. An institution's failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities. Failure to comply with the Fair Lending Laws could result in enforcement actions by the OCC, the CFPB, and other federal regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice.  
    
  USA Patriot Act of 2001.   The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 ("Patriot Act") substantially broadened the scope of United States anti money-laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial scope of United States jurisdiction. The United States Treasury Department has issued a number of regulations under the Patriot Act that apply to financial institutions such as the Bank. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply satisfactorily with all relevant Patriot Act requirements, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution.  

Regulatory Capital Requirements.   Bank holding companies and federally insured banks are required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital. The Federal Reserve establishes capital standards applicable to all bank holding companies, and the OCC establishes capital standards applicable to all national banks. The Federal Reserve and the OCC implemented new capital rules, effective January 1, 2015, that substantially amend the existing capital rules for bank holding companies and banks. These new rules reflect, in part, certain standards initially adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2010 (which standards are commonly referred to as  Basel III ) as well as requirements contemplated by the Dodd-Frank Act.   
    
  The recent rules implemented a new capital ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk based assets. Common equity Tier 1 capital generally consists of retained earnings and common stock instruments (subject to certain adjustments) as well as accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) except to the extent that the Company and the Bank exercise a one-time irrevocable option to exclude certain components of AOCI, which the Company and the Bank have done.  Tier 1 capital also includes non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and limited amounts of minority interests.  Regulatory deductions from capital include goodwill and intangible assets.  The new rules modify the manner in which certain capital elements are determined, including but not limited to, requiring certain deductions related to mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets.  Total capital consists of Tier 1 capital  and supplementary capital. Supplementary capital consists of certain capital instruments that do not qualify as core capital as well as general valuation loan and lease loss allowances up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets. Supplementary capital may be used to satisfy the risk-based requirement only in an amount equal to the amount of Tier 1 capital.  
    
  In determining the required amount of risk-based capital, total assets, including certain off-balance-sheet items, are multiplied by a risk-weight factor based on the risks inherent in the type of assets held by an institution. The risk categories range from 0% for low-risk assets such as U.S. Treasury securities and GNMA securities to 1,250% for various types of loans and other assets  
  
   22

deemed to be of higher risk. Single-family residential loans having loan-to-value ratios not exceeding 80% and meeting certain additional criteria, as well as certain multi-family residential loans, qualify for a 50% risk-weight treatment. The book value of each asset is multiplied by the risk factor applicable to the asset category, and the sum of the products of this calculation equals total risk-weighted assets. The new rules make changes in the methods of calculating certain risk-based assets, which in turn affects the calculation of risk-based ratios. Higher or more sensitive risk weights are assigned to various categories of assets, among which are commercial real estate, credit facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property, certain exposures or credit that are 90 days past due or are nonaccrual, foreign exposures, certain corporate exposures, securitization exposures, equity exposures and in certain cases mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets.  
    
  Both the Company and the Bank are required to have a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%. In addition, both the Company and the Bank are required to have a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 6.0% and a total risk-based ratio of 8.0%. Both the Company and the Bank are required to establish a  conservation buffer,  consisting of common equity Tier 1 capital, equal to 2.5%.  The capital conservation buffer is designed to ensure that banks build up capital buffers outside periods of stress, which can be drawn down as losses are incurred.  An institution that does not meet the conservation buffer will be subject to restrictions on certain activities including payment of dividends, stock repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers.  The conservation buffer is phased in beginning in 2016 and will take full effect on January 1, 2019. Certain calculations under the rules will also have phase-in periods.   
    
  The Federal Reserve and the OCC are also authorized to impose capital requirements in excess of these standards on individual institutions on a case-by-case basis.  Management believes that the current capital levels of the Company and the Bank are sufficient to be in compliance with the fully phased-in standards under the new rules.   
    
  Any bank holding company or national bank that fails the capital requirements is subject to possible enforcement actions.  Such actions could include a capital directive, a cease and desist order, civil money penalties, restrictions on an institution's operations and/or the appointment of a conservator or receiver.  Federal Reserve and OCC capital regulations provide that such supervisory actions, through enforcement proceedings or otherwise, could require one or more of a variety of corrective actions.       
  For information regarding compliance with each of these capital requirements by the Company and the Bank as of    September 30, 2016  , see Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof.  
    
  Prompt Corrective Action.    Federal statutes establish a supervisory framework based on five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. An institution s category depends upon its capital levels in relation to relevant capital measures, which include a risk-based capital measure, a leverage ratio capital measure and certain other factors. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations that implement this statutory framework.  
    
  The prompt corrective action rules, which apply to the Bank but not the Company, are modified to include a common equity Tier 1 risk-based ratio and to increase certain other capital requirements for the various thresholds. For example, the requirements for the Bank to be considered well-capitalized under the rules are a 5.0% Tier 1 leverage ratio, a 6.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based ratio, an 8.0% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a 10.0% total risk-based capital ratio. To be adequately capitalized, those ratios are 4.0%, 4.5%. 6.0% and 8.0%, respectively. 
    
  An institution that is not well capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits, including restrictions on the rates it can offer on its deposits, generally. Any institution that is neither well capitalized nor adequately capitalized is considered undercapitalized. Federal law authorizes the OCC to reclassify a well-capitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized institution or an undercapitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category. The OCC may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank exceeded the requirements of a well capitalized institution.  
    
  Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests ("DFAST").     The Federal Reserve and the OCC have issued final rules establishing company-run annual stress tests for bank holding companies and national banks, respectively, with assets between $10 and $50 billion.   
    
  Management has conducted stress tests to quantify the impact of changing economic conditions on asset quality, net income, and capital.  These stress tests are used to assist in the determination of whether capital is sufficient to absorb losses that could result from adverse economic conditions. It also assists management in thinking critically about the external environment by focusing on changing markets and discussing future trends, and it enables management to form contingency plans in the event of downside scenarios.  The nine-quarter stress test results as of December 31, 2015 for the Company and the Bank were submitted to the Federal Reserve and the OCC by the July 31, 2016 deadline, and the severe adverse results were filed in an 8-K on October 27, 2016.

Item 1A. 
    Risk Factors 
       
  Ownership of the Company's common stock involves risk. Investors should carefully consider, in addition to the other information set forth herein, the following risk factors: 
  Current economic conditions pose challenges and could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.    
  The Company is operating in an uncertain economic environment, including lackluster national and global conditions, accompanied by very low interest rates. Financial institutions can be affected by changing conditions in the real estate and financial markets.  Dramatic declines in the housing market in past years, with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment, resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions. While conditions have improved, a return to a recessionary economy could result in financial stress on the Bank's borrowers that could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. Deteriorating conditions in the regional economy served by the Company could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in its allowance for loan losses. The Company could also face the following risks in connection with the following events:  
             
    Ineffective monetary policy or other market conditions could cause rapid changes in interest rates and asset values that would have a materially adverse impact on the Company's profitability and overall financial condition. 
                
    Market developments may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns, resulting in increased delinquencies and default rates on loans and other credit facilities. 
                
    The processes the Company uses to estimate the allowance for loan losses and other reserves may prove to be unreliable. Such estimates rely upon complex modeling inputs and judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions, which may be rendered inaccurate and/or no longer subject to accurate forecasting. 
                
    The Company's ability to assess the creditworthiness of its borrowers may be impaired if the models and approaches it uses to select, manage, and underwrite loans become less predictive of future charge-offs. 
                
    Regulatory scrutiny of the industry could increase, leading to harsh regulation of the industry that could lead to a higher cost of compliance, limit the Company's ability to pursue business opportunities and increase its exposure to the judicial system and the plaintiff s bar. 
                
    Further erosion in the fiscal condition of the U.S. Treasury could lead to new taxes that would limit the ability of the Company to pursue growth and return profits to shareholders. 
     If these conditions or similar ones continue to exist or worsen, the Company could experience continuing or increased adverse effects on its financial condition. 
    
  The effects of the economic recession were severe in the Company's primary market areas.  
  Substantially all of the Bank's loans are to individuals, businesses and real estate developers in the Pacific Northwest, Arizona, Utah, Texas, New Mexico and Nevada, and the Bank's business depends significantly on general economic conditions in these market areas. Unemployment rates have improved but continue to be high in most of the Company's market areas. Severe declines in housing prices and property values were acute in the Company's primary market areas.  Most areas are improving in real estate values.  However, a further deterioration in economic conditions or a prolonged delay in economic recovery in these market areas could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business:  
             
    Loan delinquencies may increase. 
                
    Problem assets and foreclosures may increase. 
                
    Demand for the Bank's products and services may decline. 
                
    Collateral for loans made by the Bank, especially real estate, may decline in value, in turn reducing a customer's borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with the loans. 
     A downturn in the real estate market would hurt the Company's business.      
  The Company's business activities and credit exposure are concentrated in real estate lending. The market for real estate is cyclical and the outlook for this sector is uncertain.  A downturn in the real estate market, accompanied by falling values and increased foreclosures would hurt the Company's business because a large majority of its loans are secured by real estate.  
  Actions by other lenders or bank regulators could depress the value of the Company's real estate holdings, if lenders aggressively dispose of properties because of demand by their regulators or the prevailing business conditions.  If a significant decline in market values occurs, the collateral for the Company's loans will provide decreasing levels of security.  As a result, the Company's ability  
  
   25 

     Table of Contents  

to recover the principal amount due on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate will be diminished, and the Company will be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans.  
  The Company owns real estate as a result of foreclosures resulting from non-performing loans.  If other lenders or borrowers liquidate significant amounts of real estate in a rapid or disorderly fashion, or if the FDIC elects to dispose of significant amounts of real estate from failed financial institutions in a similar fashion, it could have an adverse effect on the values of the properties owned by the Company. In such a case, the Company may incur further write-downs and charge-offs, which could, in turn, adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. 
  The Company may suffer losses in its loan portfolio despite its underwriting and loan collection practices.    
  The Company seeks to mitigate the risks inherent in its loan portfolio by adhering to specific underwriting and loan collection practices. Underwriting practices often include analysis of a borrower's prior credit history; financial statements; tax returns; cash flow projections; valuation of collateral; personal guarantees of loans to businesses; and verification of liquid assets. If the underwriting process fails to capture accurate information or proves to be inadequate, the Company may incur losses on loans that appeared to meet its underwriting criteria, and those losses may exceed the amounts set aside as reserves in the allowance for loan losses.  Loan collection resources may be expanded to meet increases in nonperforming loans resulting from economic downturns or to service any loans acquired, resulting in higher loan administration costs.  The Company is also exposed to the risk of improper documentation of foreclosure proceedings that would also increase the cost of collection.  There is also the risk that loss-sharing agreements with the FDIC may not be fulfilled. 
  The Company recently upgraded its core technology infrastructure, which may expose it to significant risks.             
    
  The Company recently completed the transition from a stable, cost-efficient but aging legacy operating system to a more modern, efficient, scalable system.  The Company believes the new system will allow it to better provide its products and services to its customers but it is now more dependent on the third party vendor to provide the necessary services and support.  Any disruption of such services, or the termination of a third-party license or service agreement related thereto, could adversely affect the Company s ability to provide and service customer products.   
    
  In addition, when the Company acquires other institutions or branches, the success and value of the transaction can depend in part on the Company s ability to seamlessly integrate the acquired customers  services and products with the technology platform. Failure to do so can lead to, among other things, dissatisfaction among acquired customers and the loss of the business of such customers. 
  The Company has risk of systems failures and security risk, including "hacking" and "identity theft."   
    
  The Company relies extensively on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of its information technology and telecommunications systems.  Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in its customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems and could damage its reputation, result in loss of customer business, subject it to regulatory scrutiny, or expose it to civil litigation and possible financial liability.  This applies to internally developed systems and the systems of third-party service providers.  
    
  While the Company believes it has robust information systems and security procedures, controls and policies designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of its information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur, or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed.  Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate protective measures.  
    
  To date the Company has not experienced any material losses related to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, but there can be no assurance that it will not suffer such attacks and losses in the future.  The Company s risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, its plans to continue to implement internet banking and mobile banking channels, expand operations and use third-party information systems.   
    
  Cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of the Company's controls, processes and practices designed to protect customer information, its systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for the Company.  As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or refine our protective measures against these threats.

The Company's business is subject to interest rate risk and changes in market interest rates may negatively affect its results of operations and financial condition.    
    
  The Company's primary source of income is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income generated by interest-earning assets and the interest expense generated by interest-bearing liabilities. The level of net interest income is a function of the average balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the spread between the amounts of the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by such external factors as the local economy, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (the  FOMC ), and market interest rates.  Management is unable to predict these external factors, including the fluctuations of market interest rates, which are affected by many drivers, including inflation, recession, unemployment, monetary policy, domestic and international disorder, instability in domestic and foreign financial markets, and investor and consumer demand.  
  Furthermore, movements in interest rates, the pace at which such movements occur, and the volume and mix of the Company s interest-bearing assets and liabilities influence the level of net interest income. The cost of the Company's deposits is largely based on short-term interest rates, the level of which is driven by the FOMC. However, the yields generated by its long-term loans, such as single-family residential and multifamily mortgage loans, and securities are typically driven by longer-term (10 year) interest rates, which are set by the market and vary from day to day.  During the last few years the Federal Reserve's unprecedented involvement in the purchase of assets, commonly know as "quantitative easing," has caused interest rates to be lower than they would have been without such involvement.  The timing and impact of the withdrawal of this quantitative easing remains unknown.   
  If the interest rates on the Company's interest-bearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on its interest-earning assets, the result could be a reduction in net interest income and with it, a reduction in earnings. Net interest income and earnings would be similarly impacted were the interest rates on interest-earning assets to decline more quickly than the interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities.  In addition, changes in interest rates could affect the Bank's ability to originate loans and attract and retain deposits; the fair values of its securities and other financial assets; the fair values of its liabilities; and the average lives of its loan and securities portfolios. Additionally, decreases in interest rates could lead to increased loan refinancing activity, which, in turn, would alter the balance of the Company's interest-earning assets and impact net interest income. Increases in interest rates could reduce loan refinancing activity, which could result in compression of the spread between loan yields and more quickly rising funding rates.   
  The Company may be exposed to movements in market rates to a degree not experienced by other financial institutions.  The Company must carefully manage interest rate risk as a result of its significant portfolio of fixed-rate single-family home loans, which are longer-term in nature than the customer accounts and borrowed money that constitute its liabilities. The Company manages its interest rate risk in part by growing the fixed-rate loan portfolio when yields are higher and focusing on loans or investments with shorter-term characteristics, such as construction or commercial loans, when loan rates are lower.  This balance sheet strategy in conjunction with a strong capital position has allowed the Company to manage interest rate risk through all interest rate cycles. Low operating costs have contributed further to the strong capital position. Although the Company has implemented asset and liability management policies and procedures that seek to minimize or contain this interest rate risk, these policies may not be successful in the future.  
  The Company relies, in part, on external financing to fund its operations and the unavailability of such funding in the future could adversely impact its growth and prospects.    
  The Company relies on customer deposits, advances from the FHLB of Des Moines and other borrowings to fund its operations. Management has historically been able to replace maturing deposits if desired; however the Company may not be able to replace such funds at any given point in time if its financial condition or market conditions change or if the cost of doing so might adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations.  
  Although the Company considers its sources of funds adequate for its liquidity needs, it may seek additional debt in the future to achieve its long-term business objectives. Such borrowings, if sought, may not be available to the Company or, if available, may not be on favorable terms. If additional financing sources are unavailable or are not available on reasonable terms, the Company's financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be adversely affected.  
  The Company's ability to pay dividends is subject to limitations that may affect its ability to pay dividends to its stockholders.    
  The Company is a separate legal entity from its subsidiary and does not have significant operations of its own. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by the Bank's earnings and capital, as well as various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank and other factors, that the Bank may not pay dividends to the Company.  If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company, the Company may not be able to pay dividends on its common stock.

Consequently, the inability to receive dividends from the Bank could adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.  
  The market price for the Company's common stock may be volatile.  
  The market price of the Company's common stock could fluctuate substantially in the future in response to a number of factors, including those discussed below. The market price of the Company's common stock has in the past fluctuated significantly and is likely to continue to fluctuate significantly. Some factors that may cause the price of its common stock to fluctuate include:  

variations in the operating results of the Company and its competitors 
                
    changes in securities analysts' estimates of the Company's future performance and the future performance of its competitors 
                
    announcements by the Company or its competitors of mergers, acquisitions and strategic partnerships 
                
    additions or departure of key personnel 
                
    events affecting other companies that the market deems comparable to the Company 
                
    general conditions in the financial markets and real estate markets 
                
    general conditions in the United States 
                
    the presence or absence of short selling of the Company's common stock 
                
    future sales of the Company's common stock or debt securities 
     The stock markets in general have experienced substantial price and trading fluctuations. These fluctuations have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of the Company's common stock.  
  A person holding the Company's common stock could have the voting power of their shares of common stock on all matters significantly reduced under Washington's anti-takeover statutes, if the person acquires 10% or more of the voting stock of the Company.  
  The Company is incorporated in the state of Washington and subject to Washington state law. Some provisions of Washington state law could interfere with or restrict takeover bids or other change-in-control events affecting us. For example, Chapter 23B.19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act, with limited exceptions, prohibits a  target corporation  from engaging in specified  significant business transactions  for a period of five years after the share acquisition by an acquiring person, unless:  
             
    the prohibited transaction or the acquiring person's purchase of shares was approved by a majority of the members of the target corporation's board of directors prior to the acquiring person's share acquisition; or 
                
    the prohibited transaction was both approved by the majority of the members of the target corporation's board and authorized at a shareholder meeting by at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting shares (excluding the acquiring person's shares) at or subsequent to the acquiring person's share acquisition.  An acquiring person is defined as a person or group of persons that beneficially own 10% or more of the voting securities of the target corporation. Such prohibited transactions include, among other things: 
              * 
    certain mergers, or consolidations with, disposition of assets to, or issuances of stock to or redemption of stock from, the acquiring person; 
              * 
    termination of 5% or more of the employees of the target corporation as a result of the acquiring person's acquisition of 10% or more of the shares;  
              * 
    allowing the acquiring person to receive any disproportionate benefit as a shareholder; and 
              * 
    liquidating or dissolving the target corporation. 
     After the five-year period, certain  significant business transactions  are permitted, if they comply with certain  fair price  provisions of the statute or are approved by a majority of the outstanding shares other than those of which the acquiring person has beneficial ownership. As a Washington corporation, the Company is not permitted to  opt out  of this statute. 
  The Company's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely impacted by issues arising from certain industry deficiencies in foreclosure practices, including delays and challenges in the foreclosure process. 
  Foreclosure process issues and the potential legal and regulatory responses to them could negatively impact the process and timing to completion of foreclosures for residential mortgage lenders, including the Bank. Foreclosure timelines have increased in recent years due to, among other reasons, delays associated with the significant increase in the number of foreclosure cases as a result of economic downturns, additional consumer protection initiatives related to the foreclosure process and voluntary or, in some cases, mandatory programs intended to permit or require lenders to consider loan modifications or other alternatives to foreclosure.  Increases in the foreclosure timeline may have an adverse effect on collateral values and the Company's ability to minimize its losses.

The Company's ability to originate mortgage loans has been adversely affected by the increased competition resulting from the involvement of the U.S. Government, the Federal Reserve and Government-Sponsored Enterprises ( GSEs ) in the residential mortgage market. 
  Over the past few years, the Company has faced increased competition for mortgage loans due to the increased involvement of the GSEs in the mortgage market as a result of the recent economic crisis, which has caused interest rates for thirty year fixed-rate mortgage loans that conform to GSE guidelines to remain artificially low.  Additionally, the Federal Reserve has participated in the mortgage market in an unusual manner, through its purchases of GSE mortgage-backed securities as part of its "quantitative easing" program.  The Company's one-to-four family mortgage loan repayments have been elevated, and it is possible that its one-to-four family mortgage loan repayments will outpace its loan production as a result of these factors, making it difficult for it to grow its mortgage loan portfolio and balance sheet. 
  The Company may need to increase its allowance for loan and lease losses ("ALLL") in material amounts. The Company may experience elevated amounts of net charge-offs.  
  The Company's customers may not repay their loans according to the original terms, and the collateral securing the payment of those loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. While the Company maintains an ALLL to provide for loan defaults and non-performance, losses may exceed the value of the collateral securing the loans and the allowance may not fully cover any excess loss.  
  The Company makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of its loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of its borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. The Company's ALLL is based on these judgments, as well as historical loss experience and an evaluation of the other risks associated with its loan portfolio, including but not limited to, the size and composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and geographic concentrations within the portfolio.  Federal regulatory agencies, as part of their examination process, review the Company's loans and ALLL. If the Company's assumptions and judgments used to determine the ALLL prove to be incorrect, if the value of the collateral securing the loans decreases substantially or if the Company's regulators disagree with its judgments, it may need to increase the ALLL in amounts that exceed its expectations. Material additions to the ALLL would adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition.  
  The Company may be required to increase its ALLL as a result of a recent change to an accounting standard.  
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses  . The amendments in this ASU were issued to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments that are not accounted for at fair value through net income, including loans held for investment, held-to-maturity debt securities, trade and other receivables, net investments in leases and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. The amendments require that financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The ASU eliminates the current framework of recognizing probable incurred losses and instead requires an entity to use its current estimate of all expected credit losses over the contractual life. The measurement of expected credit losses is based upon historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the financial assets. 
    
  For purchased financial assets with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination ( PCD assets ) that are measured at amortized cost, an allowance for expected credit losses is recorded as an adjustment to the cost basis of the asset. Subsequent changes in estimated cash flows would be recorded as an adjustment to the allowance and through the statement of income. 
    
  Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities will be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a direct write-down to the security's cost basis.  
    
  The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For most debt securities, the transition approach requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to the statement of financial position as of the beginning of the first reporting period the guidance is effective. For other-than-temporarily impaired debt securities and PCD assets, the guidance will be applied prospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this ASU to determine the impact but the new standard could have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.     
  The Company operates in a highly regulated industry, which limits the manner and scope of its business activities.

     Table of Contents  

The Company is subject to extensive supervision, regulation and examination by the OCC, CFPB and the FDIC. In addition, the Federal Reserve is responsible for regulating the Company. This regulatory structure is designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and consumers and not to benefit the Company's stockholders. This regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies to address not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations (including laws and regulations governing consumer credit, and anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws), but also capital adequacy, asset quality and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors. As part of this regulatory structure, the Company and the Bank are subject to policies and other guidance developed by the regulatory agencies with respect to capital levels, the timing and amount of dividend payments, the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Under this structure the OCC, the FDIC, the CFPB and the Federal Reserve have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the Company's operations if they determine, among other things, that our operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies. This supervisory framework could materially impact the conduct, growth and profitability of the Company's operations. 
  Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations also could result in a range of sanctions and enforcement actions, including the imposition of civil money penalties, formal agreements and cease and desist orders. In addition, the OCC has specific authority to take  prompt corrective action,  depending on the Bank's capital level. Currently, the Bank is considered  well-capitalized  for prompt corrective action purposes. If the Bank were designated by the OCC as  adequately capitalized,  its ability to take brokered deposits would become limited. If the Bank were to be designated by the OCC in one of the lower capital levels  undercapitalized,   significantly undercapitalized  or  critically undercapitalized,  it would be required to raise additional capital and would be subject to progressively more severe restrictions on its operations, management and capital distributions, and replacement of senior executive officers and directors.  If the Bank became  critically undercapitalized,  it would also be subject to the appointment of a conservator or receiver.  
    
  Recent national and state legislation and regulatory initiatives to support the financial services industry have been coupled with numerous restrictions and requirements that could detrimentally affect the Company's business.  
  The Dodd-Frank Act is having a substantial impact on the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act creates a framework through which regulatory reform is being written.  Many of the rules required by the Dodd-Frank Act have been implemented and others are still being drafted.  As a result, the impact of the future regulatory requirements continues to be uncertain.  
  Recent legislative, both state and national,  initiatives to support housing finance could detrimentally affect the Company's business.  
  Legislative initiatives could detrimentally impact the Company in the future.  The extent of the impact of any such legislation will be dependent on the specific details of the final legislation passed, if any.  
  The Company faces strong competition from other financial institutions and new market participants, offering services similar to those offered by the Bank.    
  Many competitors offer the types of loans and deposit services that the Company offers. These competitors include other national banks, savings associations, community banks, credit unions and other financial intermediaries. In particular, the Company's competitors include national banks and major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Additionally, recent technological breakthroughs have made it possible for other non-traditional competitors to enter the marketplace and compete for traditional banking services.  Increased competition within the Company's market area may result in reduced loan originations and deposits. Ultimately, the Company may not be able to compete with full success against current and future competitors.  
  The Company's deposit insurance premiums could increase further in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on future earnings and financial condition. 
  The FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured financial institutions, including the Bank. The FDIC charges insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF") at a specific level. The Bank's FDIC insurance premiums increased substantially beginning in 2009, and it expects to pay significant premiums in the future. Unfavorable economic conditions, increased bank failures and additional failures decreased the DIF. In order to restore the DIF to its statutorily mandated minimum of 1.35% of total deposits by September 30, 2020, the FDIC may need to increase deposit insurance premium rates.  Insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more are responsible for funding this increase. The FDIC has issued regulations to implement these provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.  It has, in addition, established a higher reserve ratio of 2% as a long-term goal which goes beyond what is required by statute.  There is no implementation deadline for the 2% ratio.  The FDIC may increase  
  
   30 

     Table of Contents  

the assessment rates or impose additional special assessments in the future to keep the DIF at the statutory target level. Any increase in the Bank's FDIC premiums could have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. 
  Non-Compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Truth-in-Lending Act, Community Reinvestment Act, Fair Lending Laws, Flood Insurance Reform Act or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions, and curtail expansion opportunities. 
  Financial institutions are required under the USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money-laundering and terrorist activities. Financial institutions are also obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network if such activities are detected. These rules also require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure or the inability to comply with these regulations could result in fines or penalties, curtailment of expansion opportunities, intervention or sanctions by regulators and costly litigation or expensive additional controls and systems. During the last few years, several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. In addition, the U.S. Government imposed and will continue to expand laws and regulations relating to residential and consumer lending activities that create significant new compliance burdens and financial risks. The Company developed policies and it continues to augment procedures and systems designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations. 
  The Company is subject to a variety of operational risks, including legal and compliance risk, fraud and theft risk and the risk of operational errors, which may adversely affect its business and results of operations.   
  The Company is,     from time to time, subject to claims and proceedings related to its operations.  These claims and legal actions, which could include supervisory or enforcement actions by its regulators, or criminal proceedings by prosecutorial authorities, could involve large monetary claims, including civil money penalties or fines imposed by government authorities, and significant defense costs.  To mitigate the cost of some of these claims, the Company maintains insurance coverage in amounts and with deductibles that it believes is appropriate for its operations.   
  Both internal and external fraud and theft are risks.  If personal, non-public, confidential or proprietary information of customers were to be mishandled or misused, the Company could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss.  Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of its systems, employees, or counterparties, or if such information were to be intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties.   
  Operational errors include clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems.  Because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified.  Because of the Company's large transaction volume and its necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process these transactions there is a risk that technical flaws or tampering or manipulation of those automated systems arising from events wholly or partially beyond its control may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability.  The Company is exposed to the risk that its business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate.   
  The occurrence of any of these risks could result in a diminished ability for the Company to operate its business, additional costs to correct defects, potential liability to clients, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, any of which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations, perhaps materially.   
  There may be future sales or other dilution of the Company's equity, which may adversely affect the market price of its common stock.  
  The Company is not restricted from issuing additional shares of common stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock. The issuance of any additional shares of common or of preferred stock or convertible securities or the exercise of such securities could be substantially dilutive to stockholders of the Company's common stock. For instance, exercise of the warrant issued to the U.S. Treasury in connection with its participation in the Capital Purchase Program diluted the value of the Company's common stock. Holders of the Company's shares of common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to its stockholders.

Such payment, at the discretion of the Committee, may be made in Shares valued at the then Fair Market Value thereof, or in cash, or partly in cash and partly in shares of Common Stock.

Approved January 19, 2011    Page   13

Copies of such Plan and Award Agreement are on file in the office of the Secretary of Washington Federal, Inc., 425 Pike Street, Seattle, Washington 98101.  Washington Federal, Inc. will furnish to the recordholder of the certificate without charge and upon written request at its principal place of business, a copy of such Plan and Award Agreement.  Washington Federal, Inc. reserves the right to refuse to record the transfer of this certificate until all such restrictions are satisfied, all such terms are complied with and all such conditions are satisfied.  
  Such stock certificate evidencing such shares shall, in the sole discretion of the Committee, be deposited with and held in custody by the Corporation until the restrictions thereon shall have lapsed and all of the terms and conditions applicable to such grant shall have been satisfied. 
  (b)        Restricted Share Grants.

  (c)        Restriction Period.    In accordance with Sections 9.01(a) and 9.01(b) of the Plan and unless otherwise determined by the Committee (in its sole discretion) at any time and from time to time, Restricted Shares shall only become unrestricted and vested in the Participant in accordance with such vesting schedule relating to such Restricted Shares, if any, as the

Committee may establish in the relevant Award Agreement (the  Restriction Period ).  During the Restriction Period, such stock shall be and remain unvested and a Participant may not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, encumber or otherwise dispose of or hypothecate such Award.  Upon satisfaction of the vesting schedule and any other applicable restrictions, terms and conditions, the Participant shall be entitled to receive payment of the Restricted Shares or a portion thereof; as the case may be, as provided in Section 9.01(d) of the Plan.   
  (d)        Payment of Restricted Share Grants.

  (f)        Accelerated Vesting for Change in Control.    Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement, all restrictions, terms and conditions applicable to all Restricted Shares then outstanding shall be deemed lapsed and satisfied as of the date of a Change in Control.

WASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  2016 ANNUAL REPORT 

BUSINESS DESCRIPTION 
    
  Washington Federal Inc. ( Company  or  Washington Federal ) is a bank holding company headquartered in Seattle, Washington that conducts its operations through Washington Federal, National Association ( Bank ), a federally chartered national bank subsidiary. 
  The Company had its origins on April 24, 1917 in Ballard, Washington and this year is celebrating its   First 100 Years   in business.  Washington Federal is engaged primarily in providing lending, depository, insurance and other banking services to consumers, mid-sized to large businesses, and owners and developers of commercial real estate.   On November 9, 1982 the Company listed and began trading on the NASDAQ.  Profitable operations have been recorded every year since and the Company is often leading the industry in important measures of financial performance such as efficiency and capital strength.  Today the stock trades at 85 times its original 1982 offering price, has paid 135 consecutive quarterly cash dividends and, with cash dividends reinvested, has returned 12,177% total shareholder return to those who invested 33 years ago. 
  Over the years, the Company has expanded to serve banking clients in eight western states.  While much has changed since its founding, one constant has been the commitment to doing business with integrity and treating employees, clients and investors fairly.  Our tagline  invested here  is intended to reflect our people-first values and express the Company s dedication to helping our neighborhoods and communities thrive.

WASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  2016 ANNUAL REPORT 

TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS 
    
  Fellow Stockholder, 
    
  It is my privilege to report that in   2016   your Company completed its ninety-ninth year in business with record results.  Net income for the year totaled   $164,049,000  , a   2.3%   increase over prior year earnings of   $160,316,000  .  Earnings per share improved for the sixth year in succession to   $1.78   from   $1.67  , a   6.6%   increase from fiscal   2015   and also the highest in our history.  It was a great year in virtually all regards.   Washington Federal has now reported profitable operations to shareholders for 34 consecutive years since our initial public offering in 1982.  
    
  The strong financial performance of the Company translated to healthy rewards for shareholders, with total return for the year of 19.69%.  In January, the cash dividend increased by   7.7%   to fourteen cents per share.  Contributing to increasing shareholder returns over the last few years has been our disciplined approach to repurchasing shares. During the fiscal year,   3,867,563   shares, representing   4.16%   of those outstanding, were repurchased at a weighted average price of   $22.72  , and in September the Board of Directors approved an additional five million shares for the program. We believe that repurchase of our stock continues to be a viable alternative for excess capital, although investment in growth is always preferable.  I d like to call your attention to the accompanying chart that compares the performance of the Company s stock to some of the peer banks within our market going back to the onset of the last recession.  The chart visually displays the value of long-term thinking and our conservative approach to financial management.   

Several operational accomplishments contributed to our good results.  For example, one of our key strategies is to diversify the loan portfolio by increasing the volume of loans originated for business purposes.  I am pleased to report that management delivered on the strategy as commercial loans represented nearly 70% of all new loan originations, which totaled a record   $3.9 billion  .  We favor commercial over consumer loans at present for two reasons:  1) Reduced exposure to rising interest rates due to shorter terms and floating rates, and  2) Fewer regulatory burdens as commercial borrowers are presumed by the government to be sophisticated.   Consumer loans outstanding are centered in plain vanilla, thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages that we originate for our own portfolio.  Mortgage lending is still a large part of our business and remains very important to our long-term prosperity.  That portfolio is  composed of the highest quality loans we place on the books, and has historically been a source of earnings stability during recessionary periods. We are in the mortgage business for the long haul. 
    
  We also made substantial progress toward the goal of improving the bank s deposit mix. Ten years ago certificates of deposit ( CDs ) represented nearly 80% of total deposits. At September 30   th   , the funding concentration in CDs had been reduced to   43%  .  Our goal is to increase transaction accounts until CDs represent 20% or less of total deposits. While more expensive to service, transaction accounts are a more stable source of funds over time and through business cycles.   
    
  A strong capital position is the keystone of our financial management philosophy.  Like equity in your own home, the capital on our balance sheet allows us to operate with less debt and enhances our financial stability. Our conservative approach has always led us to hold more capital than other banks of similar size. We know that there is a measurable cost of underleveraged capital during periods of economic prosperity, but we have yet to develop a formula that can tell us exactly the right amount of cushion needed to get through the next recession.  We gladly pay a reasonable opportunity cost in times of economic expansion to insure that Washington Federal will be standing strong after the next crisis passes, just as we were after the Great Recession.  At fiscal year-end, SNL, an independent bank rating agency, listed Washington Federal as having the strongest capital position among the 100 largest banks in the United States after adjusting for the riskiness of assets.

WASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  2016 ANNUAL REPORT 

The primary driver of profits in our business is known as Net Interest Income, which is the net difference between interest income from earning assets and interest expense paid for funding.  Despite ultra low yields on loans and investments, Net interest Income improved by   $6.8 million   over the prior year.  The improvement was accomplished largely by shifting funds from lower yielding investments to higher yielding loans.  We have also worked tenaciously over the last several years to position the Company to benefit somewhat from higher interest rates. Should both long and short term rates move higher in tandem, we expect that Net Interest Income would improve. 
    
  Our business model has historically focused on margin and therefore has not generated a prodigious amount of fee income. Although Other Income increased during the past year, this is one area that holds prospects for improved performance.  One strategic initiative will add significant economic value to our consumer checking products that we believe clients will welcome with a willingness to pay.  Another opportunity is to begin collecting fees that we chose to forego last year due to the impact to clients of the system conversion described below. Lastly, we hope to continue to grow our insurance revenues. 
    
  Expenses increased from the prior year by   $10.6 million  , generally due to higher spending on technology early in the fiscal year, although costs are now trending lower.   Our efficiency ratio, a measure of pennies spent to produce one dollar of revenue, amounted to   50.8%  ; a high ratio by our standards yet still among the best in the industry. We expect the efficiency ratio to improve this year, although investors should know that cost pressures, particularly labor related expenses, are increasing. 
    
  Finally, net income was bolstered by several events, including a   $10 million   pre-tax gain on the sale of real estate owned. Improved asset quality also enabled the Company to recapture   $6.3 million   in expense previously taken for expected loan losses that did not materialize.  It seems each year we experience some unexpected gains and that may continue; however, investors should be aware that there is always the potential for non-recurrence. The sum of the parts enabled Return on Assets to increase to   1.12%  , versus   1.10%   in the prior year, while Return on Equity increased from   8.21%   to   8.33%  . 
    
  Financial results were especially impressive given that the first half of the fiscal year found management attention laser-focused on the conversion of virtually all of the Company s operating systems.  Planning, implementation and the subsequent cleanup activities were incredibly intense and did not really abate until the end of the second fiscal quarter, leaving many of my colleagues in need of a well-earned vacation.  The project was a terrific team building experience though that created great confidence in our ability to execute on even the biggest and most complex tasks.  Improving our competitiveness, the new systems provide real time processing consistent with the expectation of today s market, and should also provide growth capacity for at least a generation. The total upgrade investment amounted to approximately $40 million and will increase the baseline cost of information technology expense by $2-3 million per year. Technology continues to advance, so ongoing investment will be needed to maintain competitive products and provide for ever-improving security measures to protect sensitive client information. The conversion did entail some disruption and we are ever so thankful to our clients for their patience with this process. 
    
  Although we wish that the endless rulemaking driven by Congress would stop, we appreciate our regulators and believe that over time we have built a relationship of mutual trust that makes it easier for all of us to function within an amazingly complex environment.  This year a brief comment on our consumer sales practices is necessary in light of well-publicized shortcomings found at another institution.  Investors and clients alike should know that our branch personnel have never operated on commission, and do not face hard cross-selling goals.  Rather, they are trained to have conversations with our clients to identify needs that can be matched against the benefits of our products. They are also trained that accounts are to be opened and fee services provided only when the client both wants   and   needs them. Our view has always been that if we simply treat people fairly and conduct business with integrity, in the long run the world will find a path to our door.  For the sake of society, I hope that we re right.   
    
  This year there have been some executive management changes that deserve acknowledgement.  Executive Vice Presidents Linda Brower, Tom Kasanders and Jack Jacobson have been virtually indispensable in building our capabilities over the past many years.  As Chief Administrative Officer, Linda transformed our back office operations to support a much larger and more complex institution than she found, while Tom and Jack led unprecedented growth in the Business Banking and Commercial Real Estate segments, respectively.  Their retirements come too soon for me, but are healthy for the organization as they open new opportunities for those they have trained so well for succession. On behalf of everyone at Washington Federal, I thank them for their professionalism, hard work, support and friendship and wish them the very best futures.  I also wish to acknowledge and congratulate Brent Beardall for his title promotion. In July, he became only the sixth person in nearly a century to be awarded the title of President.   
    
  We also continue to update and diversify the Board of Directors.  In September we added Erin Lantz to the Board.  Erin is Vice President and General Manager of Mortgages at Zillow Group, Inc.  She brings deep knowledge of the entire home buying and financing process, along with a keen understanding of consumer behaviors and the value of big data.  I look forward to introducing her to you at the upcoming Annual Meeting.

  2016 ANNUAL REPORT 

Looking to the future, prospects for growth in our core business are as promising as they ve been in some time.  The Company is in great shape financially, with the deepest management bench in our long history. New systems are stable and being steadily enhanced, asset quality is nearing historic highs, the pipeline for lending activity is robust and most of our Western U.S markets are prosperous and experiencing faster than average growth.  While we haven t forgotten the hard lessons of the last economic downturn, it s exciting to have the systems, leadership and financial wherewithal to be once again focused on growth and service to our clients as we celebrate our First 100 Years. We won t be here to see it, but as always we ll go about our business with a spirit of stewardship intended to enable a future generation to have a chance at celebrating the Second 100 Years.  
    
  In closing, allow me to thank the Board of Directors and  my colleagues on the Executive Management Committee and throughout our eight state territory for their hard work and support of the Company s values throughout a very interesting, challenging and in the end, a most rewarding year. 
    
  I look forward to seeing you at the Sheraton Hotel in downtown Seattle on   January 18, 2017   at 2:00 P.M for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  In the meantime, you can help our business grow and prosper by referring your friends, neighbors and the businesses you associate with to Washington Federal for all their banking needs 

Sincerely, 
  
  Roy M. Whitehead 
  Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer

    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

GENERAL 
  Washington Federal, Inc. is a Washington corporation headquartered in Seattle, Washington.  The Company is a bank holding company that conducts its operations through a national bank subsidiary, Washington Federal, National Association.  The Bank is principally engaged in the business of attracting deposits from the general public and investing these funds, together with borrowings and other funds, in commercial and consumer loans. As used throughout this document, the terms "Washington Federal" or the "Company" refer to Washington Federal, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries and the term "Bank" refers to the operating subsidiary Washington Federal, National Association. 
  The Company's fiscal year end is September 30th.  All references to   2016  ,   2015   and   2014   represent balances as of   September 30, 2016  ,   September 30, 2015   and   September 30, 2014  , or activity for the fiscal years then ended.  
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, estimated amounts may fluctuate from one reporting period to another due to changes in assumptions underlying estimated values. 
  The Company has determined that the only accounting policy critical to an understanding of the consolidated financial statements of Washington Federal relates to the methodology for determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses.  The Company maintains an allowance to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio.  The allowance is based on ongoing, quarterly assessments of the probable and estimable losses inherent in the loan portfolio.  
  The general loan loss allowance is established by applying a loss percentage factor to the different loan types.  For example, residential real estate loans are not individually analyzed for impairment and loss exposure because of the significant number of loans, their relatively small balances and their historically low level of losses.  See the "Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses" section below for additional information about establishing the loss factors.  Specific allowances may be established for loans that are individually evaluated.  

INTEREST RATE RISK 
    
  The primary source of income for the Company is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income generated by interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred for interest-bearing liabilities.  The level of net interest income is a function of the average balance of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the difference between the yield on earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.  Both the pricing and mix of the Company's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities influence these factors.  All else being equal, if the interest rates on the Company's interest-bearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on its interest-earning assets, the result would be a reduction in net interest income and with it, a reduction in net earnings.   
    
  Based on Management's assessment of the current interest rate environment, the Company has taken steps, including growing shorter-term loans and transaction deposit accounts, investing in variable-rate securities and extending the maturity on borrowings, to position the Company for changing interest rates.   
    
  The Company's balance sheet strategy, in conjunction with low operating costs, has allowed the Company to manage interest rate risk, within guidelines established by the Board, through all interest rate cycles. It is management's objective to grow the dollar amount of net interest income, through the rate cycles, acknowledging that there will be some periods of time when that will not be feasible.   
    
  Management relies on various measures of interest rate risk, including modeling of changes in the Company's forecasted net interest income under various rate change scenarios, the impact of interest rate changes on the net portfolio value ("NPV") and an asset/liability maturity gap analysis.   
  Net Interest Income Sensitivity.   We estimate the sensitivity of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates using an interest rate simulation model that includes assumptions related to the level of balance sheet growth, deposit repricing characteristics and the rate of prepayments for multiple interest rate change scenarios. Interest rate sensitivity depends on certain  
  
   7 

    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

repricing characteristics in our interest-earnings assets and interest-bearing liabilities, including the maturity structure of assets and liabilities and their repricing characteristics during the periods of changes in market interest rates. The analysis assumes a constant balance sheet.  Actual results would differ from the assumptions used in this model, as Management monitors and adjusts loan and deposit pricing and the size and composition of the balance sheet to respond to changing interest rates.  
    
  In the event of an immediate and parallel increase of 200 basis points in both short and long-term interest rates, the model estimates that net interest income would increase by   3.2%   in the next year.  This compares to an estimated decrease of   2.2%   as of the   September 30, 2015   analysis. It is noted that a flattening yield curve where the spread between short-term rates and long-term rates decreases would likely result in lower net interest income.  However, Management estimates that a gradual increase of 300 basis points in short term rates and 100 basis points in long term rates over two years would result in a net interest income increase of   2.1%   in the first year and increase of   4.4%   in the second year assuming a constant balance sheet and no management intervention. 
    
  NPV Sensitivity.   The NPV is an estimate of the market value of shareholders' equity at a point in time.  It is derived by calculating the difference between the present value of expected cash flows from interest-earning assets and the present value of expected cash flows from interest-paying liabilities and off-balance-sheet contracts. The sensitivity of the NPV to changes in interest rates provides a longer term view of interest rate risk as it incorporates all future expected cash flows.  As of   September 30, 2016  , in the event of an immediate and parallel increase of 200 basis points in interest rates, the NPV is estimated to decline by   $479 million   or   18.6%   and the NPV to total assets ratio to decline to   14.8%   from a base of   16.9%  .  As of   September 30, 2015  , the NPV in the event of a 200 basis point increase in rates was estimated to decline by   $536 million   or   19.7%   and the NPV to total assets ratio to decline to   15.9%   from a base of   18.4%  .  The decreased NPV sensitivity and lower base NPV ratio is primarily due to lower interest rates as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Repricing Gap Analysis.    At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had approximately   $1.5 billion   more in liabilities subject to maturity or repricing in the next year than assets, which resulted in a one-year repricing gap of   (10.1)%   of total assets.  This compares to the   (13.4)%   gap as of   September 30, 2015  . A negative repricing gap implies that funding costs will change more rapidly than interest income on earning assets with movements in interest rates.  A negative repricing gap typically results in lower margins when interest rates rise and higher margins when interest rates decline.  The interest rate gap analysis provides management with a high-level indication of interest rate risk, but it is considered less reliable than more detailed modeling. Cash and cash equivalents of   $450 million   and stockholders' equity of   $2.0 billion   provide management with additional flexibility in managing interest rate risk going forward. 
  The following table shows the estimated repricing periods for earning assets and paying liabilities:  

(1) Asset repricing period includes estimated prepayments based on historical activity. 
  (2) Liability repricing includes estimated duration of non-maturity deposits. 

Interest Rate Spread.    The interest rate spread is measured as the difference between the rate on total loans and investments and the rate on costing liabilities at the end of each period.  The interest rate spread decreased to   2.65%   at   September 30, 2016   from   2.73%   at   September 30, 2015  . The spread decrease of 8 basis points is primarily due to payoffs of loans at generally higher interest rates and new loan originations being at lower interest rates, as well as an increase in the proportion of funding provided by FHLB advances at rates higher than the average cost of customer deposits.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average rate on  
  
   8 

    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

loans, mortgage backed securities and investments decreased by 5 basis points to   3.58%   compared to   September 30, 2015  , while the weighted average cost of funds increased by 3 basis point to   0.93%  .    

The chart below shows the volatility of our period end net interest spread (dashed line measured against the right axis) compared to the relatively consistent growth in net interest income (solid line measured against the left axis).  The relative consistency of net interest income is accomplished by actively managing the size and composition of the balance sheet through different rate cycles. 
  
  Net Interest Margin.   The net interest margin is measured using the interest income and expense over the average assets and liabilities for the period. The net interest margin increased to   3.11%   for the year ended   September 30, 2016   from   3.08%   for the year ended   September 30, 2015  . The yield on earning assets increased 2 basis points to   3.97%   and the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined by 1 basis point to   0.93%  . The higher yield on earning assets is the result of changes in the asset mix as the average balance of mortgage-backed securities and other investment securities decreased while the average balance of loans receivable increased.  The decrease in interest cost was due to changes in the mix of customer deposits and FHLB advances.

    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

For the year ended   September 30, 2016  , average earning assets increased by   0.6%   to   $13,530,558,000  , up from   $13,444,499,000   for the year ended   September 30, 2015  .  During   2016  , average loans receivable increased   $912,916,000   or   10.6%  , while the combined average balances of mortgage backed securities, other investment securities and cash decreased by   $802,078,000   or   17.0%  .  Management views organic loan growth as the highest and best use of capital, thus the shift in earning assets away from  investment securities and into loans receivable is seen as beneficial.   
    
  During   2016  , average customer deposit accounts decreased   $66,870,000   or   0.6%   and the average balance of borrowings increased by   $143,530,000   or   7.8%   from   2015  .

ASSET QUALITY   ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES 
  The Company maintains an allowance to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The amount of the allowance is based on ongoing, quarterly assessments of the probable and estimable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The Company's methodology for determining the appropriateness of the allowance is primarily based on a general allowance methodology and also includes specific allowances. The Company also has a reserve for unfunded commitments. 
  The loan loss allowance is primarily established by applying a loss percentage factor to the different loan types. Management believes loan types are the most relevant factor in the allowance calculation for groups of homogeneous loans as the risk characteristics within these groups are similar.  The loss percentage factor is made up of two parts - the historical loss factor ( HLF ) and the qualitative loss factor ( QLF ).   
  The HLF takes into account historical charge-offs by loan type.  The Company uses a 10 year average of historical loss rates for each loan category multiplied by an estimated loss emergence period.  The loss emergence period is the likely period of time during which a residential or commercial loan borrower experiencing financial difficulties might be utilizing their cash reserves prior to becoming delinquent on their loan, plus the period of time that it takes the bank to work out the loans.  The Company's use of a 10 year average is intended to encompass a full credit cycle.  
  The QLF is based on management's continuing evaluation of the pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio, including changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio, actual loan loss experience, delinquency trends, current economic conditions, collateral values, geographic concentrations, seasoning of the loan portfolio, specific industry conditions, and the duration of the current business cycle. These factors are considered by loan type.  Single family residential loan sub-types are evaluated in groups by loan to value, non-owner or owner occupied, and delinquency status.  Credit quality has been improving in most loan categories during the year, but at different paces.  In addition, loan growth or declines  for each loan category are taken into consideration.   
  The total allowance for loan loss increased by   $6,665,000  , or   6.2%   from   $106,829,000   as of   September 30, 2015   to   $113,494,000   at   September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $366,000   of specific reserves for individually evaluated loans and the remaining balance of   $113,128,000   is general allowance, which was comprised of   $89,918,000   related to HLF and   $23,210,000   related to qualitative factors. The Company released   $6,400,000   of allowance for loan losses in   2016   due in large part to net recoveries of previously charged off loans of   $13,065,000  .  This was comprised of   $19,065,000   in recoveries and   $6,000,000   in charge offs in   2016  .   
  The ratio of the allowance for loan losses and reserves for unfunded commitments to total gross loans decreased to   1.07%    as of    September 30, 2016   from   1.13%    as of   September 30, 2015   due to the combination of improving credit quality and loan growth.  
  The reserve for unfunded commitments was   $3,235,000   as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   $3,085,000   as of   September 30, 2015  .  
  The recovery of the carrying value of loans is susceptible to future market conditions beyond the Company's control, which may result in losses or recoveries differing from those estimated.   
  Restructured loans.    Restructured single-family residential loans are reserved for under the Company's loan loss reserve methodology.  Most troubled debt restructured ("TDR") loans are accruing and performing loans where the borrower has proactively approached the Company about modifications due to temporary financial difficulties.  Each request is individually evaluated for merit and likelihood of success.  As of   September 30, 2016  , single-family residential loans comprised   87.2%   of restructured loans.  The concession for these loans is typically a payment reduction through a rate reduction of 100 to 200 bps for a specific term, usually six to twelve months. Interest-only payments may also be approved during the modification period.  
  Outstanding TDRs decreased to   $261,531,000   as of   September 30, 2016   from   $302,713,000   as of the prior year end. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   96.2%   of the restructured loans were performing. During   2016  , there were additions of   $27,184,000   and reductions of   $68,366,000   due to prepayments and transfers to real estate owned ("REO"). 
  Concessions for construction, land A D and multi-family loans are typically an extension of maturity combined with a rate reduction of normally 100 bps.  Before granting approval to modify a loan in a TDR, a borrower s ability to repay is considered  
  
   12 

    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

by evaluating its current income levels, debt to income ratio, credit score, loan payment history, and an updated evaluation of the secondary repayment source.    
  If a loan is on non-accrual status before becoming a TDR it will stay on non-accrual status following restructuring until it has been performing for at least six months, at which point it may be moved to accrual status.  If a loan is on accrual status before it becomes a TDR, and it is concluded that a full repayment is highly probable, it will remain on accrual status following restructuring.  If the homogeneous restructured loan does not perform, it is placed in non-accrual status when it is 90 days delinquent.  For commercial loans, six consecutive payments on newly restructured loan terms are required prior to returning the loan to accrual status.  After the required six consecutive payments are made, a management assessment may conclude that collection of the entire principal and interest due is still in doubt.  In those instances, the loan will remain on non-accrual.  A loan that defaults and is subsequently modified would impact the Company's delinquency trend, which is part of the QLF component of the general reserve calculation.  Any modified loan that re-defaults and is charged-off would impact the HLF component of our general reserve calculation. 
  Non-performing assets.    Non-performing assets were   $71,441,000  , or   0.48%   of total assets, at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $128,908,000  , or   0.88%   of total assets, at   September 30, 2015  .     
  The following table provides detail related to the Company's non-performing assets. 

The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-accrual loans increased to   267.59%   as of   September 30, 2016   from   157.54%   as of   September 30, 2015  .  This is primarily due to the   37.5%   decrease in non-accrual loans.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  The principal sources of funds for the Company's activities are loan repayments, net deposit inflows, repayments and sales of investments, borrowings and retained earnings.  Washington Federal's principal sources of revenue are interest on loans and interest and dividends on investments. 
  The Company's net worth at   September 30, 2016   was   $1,975,731,000   or   13.27%   of total assets as compared to   $1,955,679,000   or   13.42%   of total assets at   September 30, 2015  .  The Company's net worth was impacted in the year by net income of   $164,049,000  , the payment of   $49,926,000   in cash dividends, treasury stock purchases that totaled   $87,850,000  , as well as a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of   $11,509,000  .  The Company paid out   30.4%   of its   2016   earnings in cash dividends to common shareholders, compared with   31.9%   last year.  For the year ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company returned   88.7%   of net income to shareholders in the form of cash dividends, stock repurchases and warrant repurchases as compared to   110.9%   for the year ended   September 30, 2015  . Management believes the Company's strong net worth position allows it to manage balance sheet risk and provide the capital support needed for controlled growth in a regulated environment.   
  The Bank has a credit line with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines ("FHLB") equal to 49.0% of total assets, providing a substantial source of additional liquidity if needed. The level of FHLB stock held varies depending on the amount of advances and other activities with the FHLB. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had   $2,391,411,000   of additional borrowing capacity at the FHLB. 
    
  The Bank has entered into borrowing agreements with the FHLB to borrow funds under a short-term floating rate cash management advance program and fixed-rate term loan agreements. All borrowings are secured by stock of the FHLB, deposits with the FHLB, and a blanket pledge of qualifying loans receivable as provided in the agreements with the FHLB.  
  The Company's cash and cash equivalents were   $450,368,000   at   September 30, 2016  , which is an   58.6%   increase from the balance of   $284,049,000   as of the prior year end.  See  Interest Rate Risk  above and the  Statement of Cash Flows  included in the financial statements for details regarding this change.

CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION 
  Available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities.   Available-for-sale securities decreased   $457,669,000  , or   19.23%  , during the year ended   September 30, 2016   to   $1,922,894,000   due to principal repayments of   $537,255,000   and the sale of   $50,741,000   of available-for-sale securities that were partially offset by purchases of   $137,591,000   of available-for-sale securities. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a net unrealized gain on available-for-sale securities of   $13,710,000  , which is recorded net of tax as part of stockholders' equity.  
  Held-to-maturity securities declined by   $225,617,000  , or   13.73%  , during the year ended   September 30, 2016   to   $1,417,599,000   due to paydowns and maturities. There were no held to maturity securities purchased or sold during the year ended   September 30, 2016  . Rising interest rates may cause these securities to be subject to unrealized losses.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the net unrealized gain on held-to-maturity securities was   $23,957,000  , which management attributes to the change of interest rates since acquisition.   
  Loans receivable.   Loans receivable, net of related contra accounts, increased   $740,286,000  , or   8.1%  , to   $9,910,920,000   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $9,170,634,000   one year earlier. This increase resulted primarily from record high originations of   $3,948,534,000  , which represented a   27.2%   increase over originations in the prior year.  There were also loan purchases of   $105,420,000   during the year ended   September 30, 2016  .  Commercial loan originations accounted for   69.1%   of total originations and consumer originations were   30.9%  .  The significant increase in loan origination resulted from a strategic emphasis on commercial lending, coupled with growing economies in all major markets.  Loan repayments for   2016   totaled   $2,935,167,000  , a   $516,620,000   or   21.4%   increase from the total repayments of   $2,418,547,000   in   2015  .  Loan repayments continue to be relatively high due to the ongoing historically low interest rate environment.      
  The following table presents the gross loan balances by category and the year over year change. 

The following table shows the change in the geographic distribution by state of the gross loan portfolio.

    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

(1) Includes loans in other states and purchased loan pools and other loans without state property information. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , FDIC covered loans net of related discounts were   $28,974,000  , a decrease of   $46,935,000   or   61.8%  ,  from   $75,909,000   as of   September 30, 2015  . The decrease is attributable to FDIC loss share coverage on commercial loans from the former Home Valley Bank that expired after September 30, 2015. The FDIC loss share coverage for single family residential loans will continue for another four years. The remaining portfolio of covered loans is expected to continue to decline over time, absent another FDIC assisted transaction. When FDIC loss share agreements expire, any remaining loans will be transferred to the non covered portfolio.  The Company continues to accrue a liability for the termination of the loss share agreements for what is known as the clawback provision of the agreement with the FDIC.  The Company estimates the amount of this liability based on actual loss experience and projected future losses and recoveries.  Contractually, the amount that will have to be paid to the FDIC for a clawback liability, if any, will be determined in 2020, after full expiry of the loss share agreements. 
    
  Non-performing assets.   NPAs (excludes discounted acquired assets) decreased to   $71,441,000   as of   September 30, 2016   from   $128,908,000   at   September 30, 2015  , a   44.6%   decrease. The decrease is due to improving credit conditions and credit quality as well as sales of REO.  Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets was   0.48%   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   0.88%   at   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Restructured Loans.   Total restructured loans declined to   $261,531,000   as of   September 30, 2016   from   $302,713,000   as of   September 30, 2015  .  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   96.2%   of the restructured loans were performing.  The   $9,948,000   of non-performing restructured loans are included in the NPAs total.  Total non-performing assets and restructured loans as a percent of total assets has declined to   2.17%   as of   September 30, 2016   from   2.89%   as of   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Real estate owned  .   As of   September 30, 2016  , real estate owned totaled   $29,027,000  , a decrease of   $32,071,000   or   52.5%   from   $61,098,000   as of   September 30, 2015   as the Bank continued to liquidate foreclosed properties.  During   2016  , the Company sold real estate owned properties for total net proceeds of   $61,132,000  .      
    
  Interest Receivable.    Interest receivable was   $37,669,000   as of   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $2,760,000   or   6.83%   since    September 30, 2015  . The change is primarily due to lower yields on earning assets. 
    
  Bank Owned Life Insurance.   Bank owned life insurance increased to   $208,123,000   as of   September 30, 2016   from   $102,496,000   as of   September 30, 2015  . The Company purchased another $100,000,000 in bank-owned life insurance during   2016   to assist in funding the growth of employee benefit costs. 
  Intangible assets.   The Company's intangible assets are made up of   $291,503,000   of goodwill and the unamortized balance of the core deposit intangible of   $5,486,000   at   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Customer deposits  .   As of   September 30, 2016  , customer deposits totaled   $10,600,852,000   compared with   $10,631,703,000   at   September 30, 2015  , a   $30,851,000   or   0.29%   decrease due primarily to a reduction in time deposits.  Consistent with its management strategy, the Company was able to increase transaction accounts by   $184,714,000   or   3.2%  , while time deposits decreased by  
  
   16 

    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

$215,565,000   or   4.5%  .  The weighted average rate paid on customer deposits during the year was   0.50%  , an increase of 2 basis points from   2015  , as a result of the low interest rate environment. 
  FHLB advances and other borrowings.   Total FHLB advances were   $2,080,000,000   at   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $1,830,000,000   at   September 30, 2015  . During   2016  , new FHLB advances totaling $300,000,000 were executed coterminously with interest rate swaps to effectively fix the weighted average interest rate at 1.38% for 6.7 years as a hedge against rising interest rates.  Partially offsetting these additional borrowings was the maturity of $50,000,000 of short term borrowings with a rate of 0.61%.  
  Contractual obligations.   The following table presents the Company's significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations, within the categories described below, by contractual maturity or payment amount.  

(1) Includes non-maturing customer transaction accounts.  
  (2) Represents final maturities of debt obligations. 
  These obligations, except for the operating leases, are included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.  The payment amounts of the operating lease obligations represent those amounts contractually due.

  COMPARISON OF 2016 RESULTS WITH 2015  
  Net Income  : Net income increased   $3,733,000  , or   2.3%  , to   $164,049,000   for the year ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $160,316,000   for the year ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  Net Interest Income  : For the year ended   September 30, 2016  , net interest income was   $420,249,000  , an increase of   $6,768,000   from the year ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase was primarily driven by a higher average balance on loans receivable. For the year ended   September 30, 2016  , average earning assets increased by   0.6%   to   $13,530,558,000  , up from   $13,444,499,000   for the year ended   September 30, 2015  .  During   2016  , average loans receivable increased   $912,916,000   or   10.6%  , while the combined average balances of mortgage backed securities, other investment securities and cash decreased by   $802,078,000   or   17.0%  . The net interest margin increased to   3.11%   for the year ended   September 30, 2016   from   3.08%   for the year ended   September 30, 2015  . The yield on earning assets increased 2 basis points to   3.97%   and the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined by 1 basis point to   0.93%  . The higher yield on earning assets is the result of changes in the asset mix as the average balance of mortgage-backed securities and other investment securities decreased while the average balance of loans receivable increased.  The decrease in interest cost was due to changes in the mix of customer deposits and FHLB advances.    
  The following table sets forth certain information explaining changes in interest income and interest expense for the period indicated compared to the same period one year ago. For each category of interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability, information is provided on changes attributable to (1) changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by old rate) and (2) changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by old volume). The change in interest income and interest expense attributable to changes in both volume and rate has been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate. 
    
  Rate / Volume Analysis:    

Provision (Release) for Loan Losses  :  The Company recorded a release of allowance for loan losses of   $6,400,000   for the year ended   September 30, 2016  , which compares to a release of   $11,162,000   for the year ended   September 30, 2015  . The releases recorded for both periods was a result of continued improvement in credit quality of the loan portfolio offset by net growth in the loan portfolio. The related improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio relates to the following factors.

    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The Company had recoveries, net of charge-offs, of   $13,065,000   for the year ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $5,370,000   of net recoveries for the year ended   September 30, 2015  . Non-accrual loans were   $42,414,000  , or   0.28%   of total assets, at   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $67,810,000  , or   0.47%   of total assets, at   September 30, 2015  , representing a decrease of   37.5%  .     
  Unfunded commitments tend to vary depending on our loan mix and the proportion share of commercial loans.  The reserve for unfunded commitments was   $3,235,000   as of   September 30, 2016  , which is an increase from   $3,085,000   at   September 30, 2015  . Management believes the allowance for loan losses plus the reserve for unfunded commitments, totaling    $116,729,000  , or   1.07%   of gross loans, is sufficient to absorb estimated losses inherent in the portfolio.  See Note E for further discussion and analysis of the allowance for loan losses as of and for the year ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Other Income  : Other income was   $47,036,000   for the year ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $6,613,000   or   16.4%   from the   $40,423,000   for the year ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase is primarily because   2016   included a gain of $3,800,000 resulting from the sale-leaseback of a branch property. During   2015  , the Company sold available-for-sale securities for   $246,826,000   and recognized a   $9,641,000   gain on sale and recorded   $10,554,000   of expense related to prepayment of a Federal Home Loan Bank advance. Deposit fee income was   $21,738,000   for the year ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $22,459,000   for the year ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Other Expense  : Operating expense was   $235,447,000   for the year ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $10,596,000   or   4.7%   from the   $224,851,000   for the year ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in   2016   is primarily due to higher information technology costs, which increased by   $15,006,000  , and other expense, which increased by   $4,390,000  . These expenses were elevated due to the Company's implementation of new core systems in November 2015. Management believes that the new technology and systems better position the Company to support future growth and expansion. These increases were partially offset by lower compensation and benefits expense, which declined by   $7,055,000  . The number of staff, including part-time employees on a full-time equivalent basis, was   1,806   and   1,838   at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Total operating expense for the years ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   equaled   1.60%   and   1.55%  , respectively, of average assets.  
    
  Gain (Loss) on Real Estate Owned:    Net gain on real estate owned was   $10,046,000   for the year ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $742,000   or   8.0%   from the   $9,304,000   for the year ended   September 30, 2015  . This amount includes ongoing maintenance expense, periodic valuation adjustments, and gains (losses) on sales of REO. 
    
  Income Tax Expense  : Income tax expense was   $84,085,000   for the year ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $5,118,000   or   5.74%   from the   $89,203,000   for the year ended   September 30, 2015  . The effective tax rate for   2016   was   33.89%   as compared to   35.75%   for the year ended   September 30, 2015  . The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to the effects of the addition of bank owned life insurance and increased investment in low income housing tax credit partnerships as well as tax free loans. 
  COMPARISON OF   2015   RESULTS WITH   2014    
    
  Net income increased   $2,952,000  , or   1.9%  , to   $160,316,000   for the year ended   September 30, 2015   as compared to   $157,364,000   for the year ended   September 30, 2014  .  Net interest income was higher in   2015   by   $7,861,000   primarily due to loan growth and reduced cost of funds.  Increases in operating expenses were attributable to a full year of operations of 74 branches that were acquired in fiscal 2014 and the related increase in customer transactions.  Other income increased by   $9,764,000   or   31.8%   driven by increased volume of fee generating services related to the acquired branches and transaction deposit accounts.  Net income for the year ended   September 30, 2015   continued to benefit from improving credit quality.  The release of allowance for loan losses amounted to   $11,162,000   for the year ended   September 30, 2015   as compared to a release of   $15,401,000   for the year ended   September 30, 2014  .   
    
  The following table sets forth certain information explaining changes in interest income and interest expense for the period indicated compared to the same period one year ago. For each category of interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability, information is provided on changes attributable to (1) changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by old rate) and (2) changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by old volume). The change in interest income and interest expense attributable to changes in both volume and rate has been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate.

The releases recorded for both periods was a result of continued improvement in credit quality of the loan portfolio offset by net growth in the loan portfolio. The related improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio relates to the following factors.    
  The Company had recoveries, net of charge-offs, of   $5,370,000   for the year ended   September 30, 2015  , compared with   $14,365,000   of net recoveries for the year ended   September 30, 2014  . Non-accrual loans were   $67,810,000  , or   0.47%   of total assets, at   September 30, 2015  , as compared to   $87,431,000  , or   0.59%   of total assets, at   September 30, 2014  , representing a decrease of   37.5%  .     
  Unfunded commitments tend to vary depending on our loan mix and the proportion share of commercial loans.  The reserve for unfunded commitments was   $3,085,000   at   September 30, 2015  , which is an increase from   $2,910,000   at   September 30, 2014  .  
    
  Other Income  : Other income was   $40,423,000   for the year ended   September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $9,764,000   or   31.8%   from the   $30,659,000   for the year ended   September 30, 2014  . The increase is primarily due to deposit fee income rising by   $8,153,000   in   2015   as compared to   2014   because of an increase in the number of transaction accounts and higher fees from client derivatives. In   2015  , the Company had a   $9,641,000   gain on sales of investment securities and   $10,554,000   of expense related to prepayment of a Federal Home Loan Bank advance.   
    
  Other Expense  : Operating expense was   $224,851,000   for the year ended   September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $20,842,000   or   10.22%   from the   $204,009,000   for the year ended   September 30, 2014  . The increase is primarily due to an increase of   $10,209,000   for compensation expense and   $7,352,000   for product delivery expense. These increases mostly relate to the addition of the employees from branches acquired during   2014    as they were with the Company for a full year in   2015   and also from growth in our commercial banking business.  The number of staff, including part-time employees on a full-time equivalent basis, was   1,838   and 1,909 at   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively.  The decline in full-time equivalent employees occurred as the Company continues to consolidate under-performing branches and streamline back-office operations. Total operating expense for the years ended   September 30, 2015   and   2014   equaled   1.55%   and 1.43%, respectively, of average assets.  
    
  Gain (Loss) on Real Estate Owned:    Net gain on real estate owned was   $9,304,000   for the year ended   September 30, 2015  , compared to a loss of   $2,743,000   for the year ended   September 30, 2014  . This amount includes ongoing maintenance expense, periodic valuation adjustments, and gains (losses) on sales of REO.

NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Company and nature of operations.   Washington Federal, Inc. is a Washington corporation headquartered in Seattle, Washington.  The Company is a bank holding company that conducts its operations through a national bank subsidiary, Washington Federal, National Association.  The Bank is principally engaged in the business of attracting deposits from the general public and investing these funds, together with borrowings and other funds, in one-to-four family residential real estate loans, multi-family real estate loans and commercial loans. As used throughout this document, the terms "Washington Federal" or the "Company" refer to Washington Federal, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries and the term "Bank" refers to the operating subsidiary Washington Federal, National Association. The Bank conducts its activities through a network of   238   offices located in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and Texas. 
  Basis of presentation and use of estimates.   The Company s accounting and financial reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). Inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Company makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and related disclosures. The areas that require application of significant management judgments often result in the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. In certain instances, amounts in text are presented by rounding to the nearest thousand. 
  The Company's fiscal year end is September 30th.  All references to   2016  ,   2015   and   2014   represent balances as of   September 30, 2016  ,   September 30, 2015   and   September 30, 2014  , or activity for the fiscal years then ended.   
    
  Acquisitions.   Certain Branches of Bank of America, National Association  .    During the 2014 fiscal year, the Bank acquired   74   branches from Bank of America, National Association.  This included:  effective as of the close of business on October 31, 2013,   11   branches located in New Mexico; effective as of the close of business on December 6, 2013,   40   branches located in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho; and effective as of the close of business on May 2, 2014,   23   branches located in Arizona and Nevada.  The combined acquisitions provided   $1.9 billion   in deposit accounts,   $13 million   of loans, and   $25 million   in branch properties.  The Bank paid a   1.99%   premium on the total deposits and received   $1.8 billion   in cash from the transactions.  The acquisition method of accounting was used to account for the acquisitions.  The purchased assets and assumed liabilities are recorded at their respective acquisition date estimated fair values.  The Bank recorded   $11 million   in core deposit intangible and   $31 million   in goodwill related to these transactions.  The operating results of the Company include the operating results produced by the first   11   branches  beginning November 1, 2013, for the additional   40   branches beginning December 7, 2013, and for the most recent   23   branches from May 3, 2014 forward. 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents.   Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from banks, overnight investments and repurchase agreements with an initial maturity of three months or less. 
  Investments and mortgage-backed securities.    The Company accounts for investments and mortgage-backed securities in two categories:  held-to-maturity and available-for-sale.  Premiums and discounts on investments are deferred and recognized into  income over the life of the asset using the effective interest method. 
  Held-to-maturity securities are accounted for at amortized cost, but the Company must have both the positive intent and the ability to hold those securities to maturity. There are very limited circumstances under which securities in the held-to-maturity category can be sold without jeopardizing the cost basis of accounting for the remainder of the securities in this category. 
  Available-for-sale securities are accounted for at fair value. Gains and losses realized on the sale of these securities are accounted for based on the specific identification method. Unrealized gains and losses for available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported net of the related tax effect in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders' equity. 
  Realized gains and losses on securities sold as well as other than temporary impairment charges, if any, are shown on the Consolidated Statements of Operations under the Other Income heading.  Management evaluates debt and equity securities for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis based on the securities' current credit quality, market interest rates, term to maturity and management's intent and ability to hold the securities until the net book value is recovered.

WASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016, 2015 AND 2014 

Loans receivable.     Loans that are performing in accordance with their contractual terms are carried at their amortized cost and expected interest is accrued.  The Bank also receives fees for originating loans in addition to various fees and charges related to existing loans, which may include prepayment charges, late charges and assumption fees.  
  When a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan, the Bank attempts to cure the deficiency by contacting the borrower.  Contact is made after a payment is   30   days past its grace period. In most cases, deficiencies are cured promptly. If the delinquency is not cured within   90   days, the Bank may institute appropriate action to foreclose on the property.  If foreclosed, the property is sold at a public sale and may be purchased by the Bank. 
  Restructured loans.    The Bank will consider modifying the interest rates and terms of a loan if it determines that a modification is a better alternative to foreclosure. Most troubled debt restructured ("TDR") loans are accruing and performing loans where the borrower has proactively approached the Bank about modifications due to temporary financial difficulties.  Each request is individually evaluated for merit and likelihood of success.  The concession for these loans is typically a payment reduction through a rate reduction of 100 to 200 bps for a specific term, usually   six   to   twelve   months. Interest-only payments may also be approved during the modification period. Principal forgiveness is generally not an available option for restructured loans.  Before granting approval to modify a loan in a TDR, the borrower s ability to repay is evaluated, including:  current income levels and debt to income ratio, borrower s credit score, payment history of the loan, and updated evaluation of the secondary repayment source.  The Bank also modifies some loans that are not classified as TDRs as the modification is due to a restructuring where the effective interest rate on the debt is reduced to reflect a decrease in market interest rates.   
  Non accrual loans.    Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in the judgment of management, the probability of collection of interest is deemed to be insufficient to warrant further accrual. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, previously accrued but unpaid interest is deducted from interest income. The Bank does not accrue interest on loans   90   days or more past due. If payment is made on a loan so that the loan becomes less than 90 days past due, and the Bank expects full collection of principal and interest, the loan is returned to full accrual status. Any interest ultimately collected is credited to income in the period of recovery.  A loan is charged-off when the loss is estimable and it is confirmed that the borrower is not expected be able to meet contractual obligations. 
  If a consumer loan is on non-accrual status before becoming a TDR it will stay on non-accrual status following restructuring until it has been performing for at least six months, at which point it may be moved to accrual status.  If a loan is on accrual status before it becomes a TDR, and management concludes that full repayment is probable based on internal evaluation, it will remain on accrual status following restructuring.  If the restructured consumer loan does not perform, it is placed on non-accrual status when it is   90   days delinquent.  For commercial loans,   six   consecutive payments on newly restructured loan terms are required prior to returning the loan to accrual status.  In some instances after the required six consecutive payments are made management will conclude that collection of the entire principal and interest due is still in doubt.  In those instances, the loan will remain on non-accrual.   
  Impaired loans.    Impaired loans consist of loans receivable that are not expected to have their principal and interest repaid in accordance with their contractual terms. This includes TDRs that are on non-accrual status.  Collateral dependent impaired loans are measured using the fair value of the collateral less selling costs. Non-collateral dependent loans are measured at the present value of expected future cash flows. 
  Deferred fees and discounts on loans.   Loan discounts and loan fees are deferred and recognized over the life of the loans using the effective interest method.   
  Allowance for loan losses.    The Bank maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is based on ongoing, quarterly assessments of the probable and estimable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The Bank's general methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance is to apply a loss percentage factor to the different loan types.  The loss percentage factor is made up of   two   parts - the historical loss factor ( HLF ) and the qualitative loss factor ( QLF ).  The HLF takes into account historical charge-offs by loan type.  The Bank uses an average of historical loss rates for each loan category multiplied by a loss emergence period.  This is the likely period of time during which a residential or commercial loan borrower experiencing financial difficulties might deplete their cash prior to becoming delinquent on their loan, plus the period of time that it takes the bank to work out the loans.  The QLF are based on management's continuing evaluation of the pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio, including changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio,

actual loan loss experience, current economic conditions, collateral values, geographic concentrations, seasoning of the loan portfolio, specific industry conditions, and the duration of the current business cycle. These factors are considered by loan type.   
  Specific allowances are established for loans which are individually evaluated, in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to a loan that management believes indicate the probability that a loss has been incurred.  The Bank has also established a reserve for unfunded commitments.   
  The recovery of the carrying value of loans is susceptible to future market conditions beyond the Bank's control, which may result in losses or recoveries differing from those estimated. 
  Acquired credit impaired loans.    Acquired credit impaired loans are accounted for under Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 310-30 when there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable, at acquisition, that the Company would be unable to collect all contractually required payments.  Interest income, through accretion of the difference between the carrying amount of the loans and the expected cash flows, are recognized on all acquired loans.  
  Covered assets.     Covered loans consist of single family loans acquired from Horizon Bank in 2010 and certain loans acquired from South Valley Bank and Trust ("SVBT") in fiscal 2013 that were originally recorded at their estimated fair value at the time acquired.  Loans that were classified as non-performing loans by Horizon Bank and SVBT are no longer classified as non-performing because, at acquisition, the carrying value of these loans was adjusted to reflect fair value and are covered under the FDIC loss sharing agreements.  Management believes that the book value reflects an amount that will ultimately be collected.  Covered real estate held for sale represents the foreclosed properties that were originally Horizon Bank loans or certain SVBT loans. Covered real estate held for sale is carried at the estimated fair value of the repossessed real estate.  The covered loans and covered real estate held for sale are collectively referred to as  covered assets."  When FDIC loss share agreements expire, any remaining loans will be transferred to the non covered portfolio. Covered loans are included within loans receivable on the statement of financial condition.  Covered real estate owned are included within real estate owned on the statement of financial condition. 
  FDIC indemnification asset.    FDIC indemnification asset is the receivable recorded due to the guarantee provided by the FDIC on the covered assets.  This asset declines due to collections from the FDIC on claims or the eventual expiration of the FDIC loss share agreements. The FDIC indemnification asset is included within other assets on the statement of financial condition. 
  Client derivatives.    Interest rate swap agreements are provided to certain clients who desire to convert their obligations from variable to fixed interest rates. Under these agreements, the Bank enters into a variable-rate loan agreement with a customer in addition to a swap agreement, and then enters into a corresponding swap agreement with a third party in order to offset its exposure on the customer swap agreement.  As the interest rate swap agreements with the customers and third parties are not designated as hedges under FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the instruments are marked to market in earnings.  The change in fair value of the offsetting swaps are included in interest income and interest expense and there is no impact on net income.  There is fee income earned on the swaps that is included in loan fee income.   
  Long term borrowing hedges.    The Company has entered into interest rate swaps to convert a series of future short-term borrowings to fixed-rate payments.  These interest rate swaps qualify as cash flow hedging instruments under ASC 815 so gains and losses are recorded in Other Comprehensive Income to the extent the hedge is effective. Gains and losses on the interest rate swaps are reclassified from OCI to earnings in the period the hedged transaction affects earnings and are included in the same income statement line item that the hedged transaction is recorded.  
  Commercial loan hedges.    The Company has entered into interest rate swaps to hedge long term fixed rate commercial loans.  These hedges qualify as fair value hedges under ASC 815 and provide for matching of the recognition of the gains and losses on the interest rate swap and the related hedged loan.   
  Premises and equipment.   Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.  Expenditures are capitalized for betterments and major renewals. Charges for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred.

Real estate properties acquired through foreclosure of loans or through acquisitions are recorded initially at fair value less selling costs and are subsequent recorded at lower of cost or fair value.  Any gains (losses) are shown on the real estate acquired through foreclosure line item. 
  Intangible assets.   Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of the net assets acquired.  The core deposit intangibles are acquired assets that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill.  Goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter.  Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated lives and are subject to impairment testing when events or circumstances change.  If circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable, an impairment charge could be recorded.  The Bank amortizes the core deposit intangibles over their estimated lives using an accelerated method. 
  The table below provides detail regarding the Company's intangible assets. 

The table below presents the estimated core deposit intangible asset amortization expense for the next five years. 

Income taxes.    Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, a deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The provision for income taxes includes current and deferred income tax expense based on net income adjusted for temporary and permanent differences such as depreciation, interest on state and municipal securities, and affordable housing tax credits. Income tax related interest and penalties, if applicable, and amortization of affordable housing tax credit investments are recorded within income tax expense. 
  Accounting for stock-based compensation.   We recognize in the statement of operations the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based forms of compensation issued to employees over the employees' requisite service period (generally the vesting period). The requisite service period may be subject to performance conditions.  Stock options and restricted stock awards generally vest ratably over   three   to   ten   years and are recognized as expense over that same period of time. The exercise price of each option equals the market price of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant, and the maximum term is   ten   years.   No   stock options were granted in   2016  ,   2015   or   2014  . 
    
  Certain grants of restricted stock are subject to performance-based and market-based vesting as well as other approved vesting conditions and cliff vest based on those conditions. Compensation expense is recognized over the service period to the extent restricted stock awards are expected to vest. See Note N for additional information.

  Subsequent events.   The Company has evaluated subsequent events for adjustment to or disclosure in the Company s consolidated financial statements through the date of this report, and the Company has not identified any recordable or disclosable events, not otherwise reported in these consolidated financial statements or the notes thereto, except for the following: 
  The Company paid its 135th consecutive quarterly cash dividend totaling   $12,421,733   on   November 18, 2016   to common stockholders of record on   November 4, 2016  . 

NOTE B - NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-15,   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   The amendments in this ASU address eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing diversity in practice. The specific issues identified include: debt prepayments or extinguishment costs; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies (including bank-owned life insurance policies); distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 including interim periods within that reporting period; however, early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the guidance to determine its adoption method and does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses  . The amendments in this ASU were issued to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments that are not accounted for at fair value through net income, including loans held for investment, held-to- maturity debt securities, trade and other receivables, net investments in leases and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. The amendments require that financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The ASU eliminates the current framework of recognizing probable incurred losses and instead requires an entity to use its current estimate of all expected credit losses over the contractual life. The measurement of expected credit losses is based upon historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the financial assets. 
    
  For purchased financial assets with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination ( PCD assets ) that are measured at amortized cost, an allowance for expected credit losses is recorded as an adjustment to the cost basis of the asset. Subsequent changes in estimated cash flows would be recorded as an adjustment to the allowance and through the statement of income. 
    
  Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities will be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a direct write-down to the security's cost basis.  
    
  The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For most debt securities, the transition approach requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to the statement of financial position as of the beginning of the first reporting period the guidance is effective. For other-than-temporarily impaired debt securities and PCD assets, the guidance will be applied prospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this ASU to determine the impact the new standard will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation- Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which involves several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. Under the guidance, income tax benefits and deficiencies are to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement and the tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur. An entity should also recognize excess tax benefits regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period. Excess tax benefits should be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity. In regards to forfeitures, the entity may make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest

or account for forfeitures when they occur. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 including interim periods within that reporting period; however, early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the guidance to determine its adoption method and does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  . The amendments require lessees to recognize a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The guidance also simplifies the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted upon issuance. Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this ASU to determine the impact the new standard will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  , to require all equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income (other than those accounted for under equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee). The amendments in this ASU also require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,   Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments,   which will require that the acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount is determined. The acquirer is required to also record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. In addition, an entity is required to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes to the financial statements the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The amendments in ASU 2015-16 are effective for years beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted for reporting periods for which financial statements have not been issued. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05,   Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in Cloud Computing Arrangement  . The ASU was issued to clarify a customer's accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. The amendments provide guidance to customers in determining whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license that should be accounted for as internal-use software. If the arrangement does not contain a software license, it would be accounted for as a service contract. The guidance in this ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and can be adopted either (1) prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date or (2) retrospectively. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  . The guidance in this update supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the industry topics of the codification. For public companies, this update was to be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. However, in August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which delayed the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year and permits companies to voluntarily adopt the new standard as of the original effective date. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

The Company purchased   $137,591,000   of available-for-sale investment securities and   no   held-to-maturity investment securities during   2016  . The Company sold   $50,741,000   of available-for-sale securities and there were   no   sales of held-to-maturity investment securities in   2016  .  Substantially all mortgage-backed securities have contractual due dates that exceed   twenty-five years  . 
    
  The following table shows the gross unrealized losses and fair value of securities at   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , by length of time that individual securities in each category have been in a continuous loss position. Management believes that the declines in fair value of these investments are not an other than temporary impairment as these losses are due to a change in interest rates rather than any credit deterioration.  The impairment is also deemed to be temporary because:  1)  the Bank does not intend to sell the security, and 2)  it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis of the security.

  Most loans restructured in troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs") are accruing and performing loans where the borrower has proactively approached the Company about modifications due to temporary financial difficulties.  Each request is individually evaluated for merit and likelihood of success.  The concession for these loans is typically a payment reduction through a rate reduction of 100 to 200 bps for a specific term, usually   six   to   twelve   months. Interest-only payments may also be approved during the modification period.  Principal forgiveness is not an available option for restructured loans.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the outstanding balance of TDR's was   $261,531,000   as compared to   $302,713,000    as of   September 30, 2015  .  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   96.2%   of the restructured loans were performing. Single-family residential loans comprised   87.2%   of TDR loans as of   September 30, 2016  .

A loan is charged-off when the loss is estimable and it is confirmed that the borrower is not expected to be able to meet its contractual obligations.   
    
  Non-accrual loans decreased to   $42,414,000   as of   September 30, 2016   from   $67,810,000   as of   September 30, 2015  .

Acquired loans, including covered loans, are not classified as non-performing loans because they are recorded at fair value at acquisition and reflect lifetime estimated losses at that time.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $20,175,000   in acquired loans were subject to the general allowance as the discount related to these balances was not sufficient to absorb potential losses.

The Company has an asset quality review function that analyzes the loan portfolio and reports the results of the review to the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. The single-family residential, HELOC and consumer portfolios are evaluated based on their performance as a pool of loans, since no single loan is individually significant or judged by its risk rating, size or potential risk of loss. The construction, land, multi-family, commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans are risk rated on a loan by loan basis to determine the relative risk inherent in specific borrowers or loans. Based on that risk rating, the loans are assigned a grade and classified as follows: 

Pass   the credit does not meet one of the definitions defined below. 

Special mention   A special mention credit is considered to be currently protected from loss but is potentially weak. No loss of principal or interest is foreseen; however, proper supervision and Management attention is required to deter further deterioration in the credit. Assets in this category constitute some undue and unwarranted credit risk but not to the point of justifying a risk rating of substandard. The credit risk may be relatively minor yet constitutes an unwarranted risk in light of the circumstances surrounding a specific asset. 

Substandard   A substandard credit is an unacceptable credit. Additionally, repayment in the normal course is in jeopardy due to the existence of one or more well defined weaknesses. In these situations, loss of principal is likely if the weakness is not corrected. A substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified will have a well defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard assets, does not have to exist in individual assets risk rated substandard. 

Doubtful   A credit classified doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weakness makes collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. The probability of loss is high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific pending factors that may work to the advantage and strengthening of the asset, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined. Pending factors include proposed merger, acquisition, or liquidation procedures, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral, and refinancing plans. 

Loss   Credits classified loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this asset even though partial recovery may be affected in the future. Losses should be taken in the period in which they are identified as uncollectible. Partial charge-off versus full charge-off may be taken if the collateral offers some identifiable protection. 
     The following tables provide information on loans based on credit quality indicators (defined above).

ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 
  Level 1:   Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active exchange markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. 
  Level 2:   Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active and other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
  Level 3:   Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. 
  We have established and documented the Company's process for determining the fair values of the Company's assets and liabilities, where applicable.  Fair value is based on quoted market prices, when available, for identical or similar assets or liabilities.  In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value is determined using valuation models or third-party appraisals.  The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used to measure and report the fair value of financial assets and liabilities on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. 
  Measured on a Recurring Basis 
  Available-for-sale investment securities and derivative contracts 
  Securities available for sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of debt securities are priced using model pricing based on the securities' relationship to other benchmark quoted prices as provided by an independent third party, and under GAAP are considered a Level 2 input method.  Securities that are traded on active exchanges, including the Company's equity securities, are measured using the closing price in an active market and are considered a Level 1 input method. 
  The Company offers interest rate swaps to its variable rate borrowers who want to manage their interest rate risk.  At the same time, the Company enters into the opposite trade with a counter party to offset its interest rate risk.  The Company has also entered into a commercial loan hedge as well as long term borrowing hedges using interest rate swaps.  The fair value of these interest rate swaps are estimated by a third party pricing service using a discounted cash flow technique.  These are considered a Level 2 input method.

There were no transfers between, into and/or out of Level 1, 2 or 3 during the year ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Measured on a Nonrecurring Basis 
  Impaired Loans   Real Estate Owned 
    
  Real estate owned ("REO") consists principally of properties acquired through foreclosure.  From time to time, and on a nonrecurring basis, adjustments using fair value measurements are recorded to reflect increases or decreases based on the current appraisal or estimated value of the collateral, but only up to the fair value of the real estate owned as of the initial transfer date less selling costs. 
    
  When management determines that the fair value of the collateral or the real estate owned requires additional adjustments, either as a result of an updated appraised value or when there is no observable market price, the Company classifies the impaired loan or real estate owned as Level 3.  Level 3 assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis represent impaired loans for which a specific reserve is recorded or a partial charge-off was recorded based on the fair value of collateral, as well as real estate owned where the fair value of the property was less than the cost basis. 
    
  The following table presents the recorded balance of assets that were measured at estimated fair value on a nonrecurring basis for the periods presented, and the total gains (losses) resulting from those fair value adjustments for the periods presented.  These estimated fair values are shown gross of estimated selling costs:

    The gains (losses) represent remeasurements of collateral-dependent impaired loans. 
              (2) 
    The gains (losses) represent aggregate writedowns and charge-offs on real estate owned. 
     The following describes the process used to value Level 3 assets measured on a nonrecurring basis: 
  Impaired loans   - The Company adjusts the carrying amount of impaired loans when there is evidence of probable loss and the expected fair value of the loan is less than its contractual amount.  The amount of the impairment may be determined based on the estimated present value of future cash flows or the fair value of the underlying collateral.  Impaired loans with a specific reserve allowance based on cash flow analysis or the value of the underlying collateral are classified as Level 3 assets. 
  The evaluations for impairment are prepared by the Problem Loan Review Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Credit Officer and includes the Loan Review manager and Special Credits manager, as well as senior credit officers, division managers and group executives, as applicable.  These evaluations are performed in conjunction with the quarterly allowance for loan loss process. 
  Applicable loans that were included in the previous quarter's review are reevaluated and if their values are materially different from the prior quarter evaluation, the underlying information (loan balance and collateral value) are compared.  Material differences are evaluated for reasonableness and discussions are held between the relationship manager and their division manager to understand the difference and determine if any adjustment is necessary.   
  The inputs are developed and substantiated on a quarterly basis, based on current borrower developments, market conditions and collateral values.  The following methods are used to value impaired loans: 
             
    The fair value of the collateral, which may take the form of real estate or personal property, is based on internal estimates, field observations, assessments provided by third-party appraisers and other valuation models.  The Company performs or reaffirms valuations of collateral-dependent impaired loans at least annually.  Adjustments are made if management believes that more recent information is available and relevant with respect to the fair value of the collateral. 
                
    The present value of the expected future cash flows of the loans is used for measurement of non collateral-dependent loans to test for impairment.  The Company estimates the future cash flows and then discounts those using the contractual interest rate. 
       
  Real estate owned   - When a loan is reclassified from loan status to real estate owned due to the Company taking possession of the collateral, a Special Credits officer, along with the Special Credits manager, obtains a valuation, which may include appraisals

or third-party price options, which is used to establish the fair value of the underlying collateral.  The determined fair value, less selling costs, becomes the carrying value of the REO asset.   
    
  Fair Values of Financial Instruments 
    
  U. S. GAAP requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized on the statement of financial condition, for which it is practicable to estimate those values. Certain financial instruments and all non-financial instruments are excluded from the disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value estimates presented do not reflect the underlying fair value of the Company. Although management is not aware of any factors that would materially affect the estimated fair value amounts presented below, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since the dates shown, and therefore, estimates of fair value subsequent to those dates may differ significantly from the amounts presented below.

WASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016, 2015 AND 2014 

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments: 
  Cash and cash equivalents     The carrying amount of these items is a reasonable estimate of their fair value.    
  Available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity securities     Securities at fair value are primarily priced using model pricing based on the securities' relationship to other benchmark quoted prices as provided by an independent third party, and are considered a Level 2 input method.  Equity securities which are exchange traded are considered a Level 1 input method. 
  Loans receivable     For certain homogeneous categories of loans, such as fixed- and variable-rate residential mortgages, fair value is estimated for securities backed by similar loans, adjusted for differences in loan characteristics, using the same methodology described above for AFS and HTM securities. The fair value of other loan types is estimated by discounting the future cash flows and estimated prepayments using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining term. Some loan types were valued at carrying value because of their floating rate or expected maturity characteristics. Net deferred loan fees are not included in the fair value calculation but are included in the carrying amount. 
  FDIC indemnification asset     The fair value of the indemnification asset is estimated by discounting the expected future cash flows using the current rates. 
  FHLB and FRB stock     The fair value is based upon the par value of the stock which equates to its carrying value. 
  Customer accounts     The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts, and money market accounts is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using the rates currently offered for deposits with similar remaining maturities. 
  FHLB advances     The fair value of FHLB advances and other borrowings is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar remaining maturities. 
  Interest Rate Contracts     The bank offers interest rate swaps to its variable rate borrowers who want to manage their interest rate risk.  At the same time, the bank enters into the opposite trade with a counterparty to offset its interest rate risk.  The fair value of these interest rate swaps are estimated by a third party pricing service using a discounted cash flow technique.   
  Commercial Loan Hedges     The fair value of the interest rate swaps are estimated by a third party pricing service using a discounted cash flow technique. 
  Long Term Borrowing Hedges     The fair value of the interest rate swaps are estimated by a third party pricing service using a discounted cash flow technique. 

NOTE G - DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 
    
  The Company periodically enters into certain interest rate swap agreements in order to provide commercial loan customers the ability to convert from variable to fixed interest rate payments, while the Company retains a variable rate loan. Under these agreements, the Company enters into a variable rate loan agreement and a swap agreement with the client. The swap agreement effectively converts the client s variable rate loan into a fixed rate. The Company enters into a corresponding swap agreement with a third party in order to offset its exposure on the variable and fixed components of the client's swap agreement. The Company had   $840,935,000   and   $439,416,000   notional in interest rate swaps to hedge this exposure as of   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $34,432,000   of the outstanding notional balance related to a related party loan. The interest rate swaps are derivatives under FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, with changes in fair value recorded in earnings.  There was no net impact to the statement of operations for the year ended   September 30, 2016   as the changes in value for the asset and liability side of the swaps offset each other.   
    
  The Company has also entered into interest rate swaps, some of which are forward-starting, to convert certain existing and future short-term borrowings to fixed rate payments.  The primary purpose of these hedges is to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates, specifically LIBOR rates, which are a benchmark for the short term borrowings. The hedging program qualifies as a cash flow hedge under ASC 815, which provides for offsetting of the recognition of gains and losses of the interest rate swaps and the hedged items.  The hedged item is the LIBOR portion of the series of existing or future short-term fixed rate borrowings over the term of the interest rate swap.  The change in the fair value of the interest rate swaps is recorded in other comprehensive income. The

Company had   $700,000,000   and   $400,000,000   notional in interest rate swaps to hedge existing and anticipated future borrowings as of   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  The unrealized loss, gross of the related tax benefit, on these interest rate swaps as of   September 30, 2016   was   $31,347,000  .    
    
  The Company has also entered into an interest rate swap to hedge the interest rate risk of an individual fixed rate commercial loan and this relationship qualifies as a fair value hedge under ASC 815, which provides for offsetting of the recognition of gains and losses of the interest rate swap and the hedged item. The Company hedges this loan using an interest rate swap with a notional amount of   $54,155,000   and   $54,815,000   as of   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.

NOTE K - FHLB ADVANCES AND OTHER BORROWINGS 
    
  The table below shows the maturity dates of outstanding FHLB advances. 

There were no advances included in the above table which are callable by the FHLB.  
    
  Financial data pertaining to the weighted-average cost and the amount of FHLB advances were as follows. 

On June 1, 2015, the FHLB of Seattle merged into the FHLB of Des Moines to create a larger, financially stronger, member-owned cooperative. The Bank has a credit line with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines ("FHLB") equal to   49.0%   of total assets. The FHLB of Des Moines has assumed the Bank's advances with the FHLB of Seattle as of the merger date.  
    
  The Bank has entered into borrowing agreements with the FHLB to borrow funds under a short-term floating rate cash management advance program and a fixed-rate term loan agreements. All borrowings are secured by stock of the FHLB, deposits with the FHLB, and a blanket pledge of qualifying loans receivable as provided in the agreements with the FHLB.

The following table summarizes the Company's income tax expense (benefit) for the respective periods. 

Based on current information the Company does not expect that changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months will have a significant impact on its results of operations or financial position. The Company's liability for uncertain tax positions was   $105,000   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $110,000   as of   September 30, 2015  . These amounts, if recognized, would affect the Company's effective tax rate.  The Company records interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.    
  The Company's federal income tax returns are open for the tax years 2013 forward.  The Company has been examined by the Internal Revenue Service through the year ended September 30, 2012.  
  State income tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of   three   to   five   years after filing of the respective return.  The state impact of any federal changes remains subject to examination by various states for a period of up to   two   years after formal notification to the states.  The Company's unrecognized tax benefits are related to state tax returns open from 2013 through   2016  .   

NOTE  M - 401(k) AND EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN 
    
  The Company maintains a 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "Plan") for the benefit of its employees. Company contributions are made annually as approved by the Board of Directors. Such amounts are not in excess of amounts permitted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. 
    
  Plan participants may make voluntary after-tax contributions of their considered earnings as defined by the Plan.  In addition, participants may make pre-tax contributions up to the statutory limits through the 401(k) provisions of the Plan.  The annual addition from contributions to an individual participant's account in this Plan cannot exceed the lesser of   100%   of base salary or   $53,000  .   
    
  Effective January 1, 2016, new employees become eligible to participate in the Plan upon completion of   one year   of service. Such eligible employees become a participant in the Plan on the first day of the calendar quarter (January 1, April 1, July 1 or October

1) coincident with or following the completion of the one year of service requirement. The Plan defines  year of service  as a 12-month period in which the eligible employee works at least 1,000 hours of service and the first eligibility service period starts on the first day of employment. After the first 12-month eligibility service period, if the Plan needs to measure another eligibility service period (e.g., if the employee does not complete 1,000 hours of service in the first 12-month period), the Plan will measure the eligibility service period on a Plan Year basis. 
    
  Effective January 1, 2014, the Company added a guaranteed safe harbor matching contribution component to the plan equal to   100%   of the first   4%   of compensation that employee's contribute to their account.  In addition to the new match being guaranteed, all safe harbor matching contributions are immediately vested.  The new match is not subject to the   6   year vesting schedule of the current profit sharing contribution.  This provides plan participants more investment flexibility.  The Company anticipates that all eligible employees, regardless of personal plan participation, will continue to receive an annual discretionary profit sharing contribution from the Company, now capped at   7%   of eligible compensation with this change. 
    
  Company contributions to the Plan amounted to   $7,600,000  ,   $8,700,000   and   $7,314,000   for the years ended   2016  ,    2015   and   2014  , respectively. 

NOTE N - STOCK AWARD PLANS 
    
  The Company's stock based compensation plan ('2011 Incentive Plan') provides for grants of stock options and restricted stock.  Stockholders authorized   5,000,000   shares of common stock to be reserved pursuant to the 2011 Incentive Plan and   3,348,400   shares remain available for issuance as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  When applicable, stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company's stock at the date of grant; those option awards generally vest based on   5   years of continuous service and have   10  -year contractual terms.  The Company's policy is to issue new shares upon option exercises.  The fair value of stock options granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.  This model requires input of highly subjective assumptions, changes to which can materially affect the fair value estimate.  Additionally, there may be other factors that would otherwise have a significant effect on the value of employee stock options granted but are not considered by the model.  Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's stock.  The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve that is in effect at the time of grant with a remaining term equal to the options' expected life.  The expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.     
    
  Stock Option Awards: 
    
  There were   no   stock options granted under the 2011 Incentive Plan during   2016  ,   2015   and   2014  .   
    
  A summary of stock option activity and changes during the year are as follows.

  Restricted Stock Awards: 
    
  The Company grants shares of restricted stock pursuant to the 2011 Incentive Plan.  The restricted stock grants are subject to a service condition and vest over a period of   one   to   seven   years.   
    
  Certain grants of restricted stock to executive officers are also subject to additional performance conditions based upon meeting certain total shareholder return targets pre-established by the Board. The Company had a total of   490,363   shares of restricted stock outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  , with a fair market value at the date of grant of   $7,845,808  .     
    
  The following table summarizes information about nonvested restricted stock activity. 

Compensation expense related to restricted stock awards was   $3,357,108  ,   $3,271,564  , and   $3,085,081   for the years ended   2016  ,    2015   and   2014  , respectively. 

NOTE O - STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY 
    
  The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements.  Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the following table) of Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and Total capital to risk weighted assets (as defined in the regulations) and Tier 1 capital to average assets (as defined in the regulations).  Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary action by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's financial statements.  The Company and the Bank are also subject to certain restrictions on the amount of dividends that they may declare without prior regulatory approval. 

64 

WASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016, 2015 AND 2014 

As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject, and the OCC categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain minimum Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 risk-based, Total risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the following table. The Bank's actual capital amounts and ratios as of these dates are also presented.  There are no conditions or events since that management believes have changed the Bank's categorization. 

At periodic intervals, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC routinely examine the Company's and the Bank's financial statements as part of their oversight. Based on their examinations, these regulators can direct that the Company's or Bank's financial statements be adjusted in accordance with their findings.   
    
  The federal banking agencies released new regulatory capital rules which became effective on January 1, 2015.  These new rules raised the minimum capital ratios and established new criteria for regulatory capital.  Minimum capital ratios for four measures are now established for capital adequacy purposes as indicated in the table above.  The Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio is  
  
   65 

WASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016, 2015 AND 2014 

new; it recognizes common equity as the highest form of capital.  The denominator for all except the leverage ratio is risk weighted assets.  The new rules also set forth a "capital conversation buffer" of up to   2.5%  .  In the event that a bank's capital levels fall below the minimum ratios plus these buffers, restrictions can be placed on the bank by its regulators.  These restrictions include reducing dividend payments, share-backs and staff bonus payments.  The purpose of these buffers is to require banks to build up capital outside of periods of stress that can be drawn down during periods of stress.  As a result, even during periods where losses are incurred, the minimum capital ratios can still be met.  The new capital rules detail a phase-in period for the new minimum ratios and the capital buffers before the full minimum ratios take effect in 2019.  The Company has calculated its capital ratios using the new rules since March 31, 2015 and the change did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  There are also new standards for Adequate and Well Capitalized criteria that are used for "Prompt Corrective Action" purposes.  To remain categorized as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain minimum Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based, Total risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the above table.  These rules are further described in the 10-K report under "Washington Federal, National Association (Bank) - Regulatory Capital Requirements".  Both the Company and the Bank have sufficient capital to meet these new rules. 
    
  The Company and the Bank are subject to regulatory restrictions on paying dividends. 
    
  The Company has an ongoing stock repurchase program and   3,867,563   shares were repurchased during   2016   at a weighted average price of   $22.72  .  In   2015  ,   5,841,204   shares were repurchased at a weighted average price of   $21.70  . As of   September 30, 2016  , Management had authorization from the Board of Directors to repurchase up to   5,039,310   additional shares.  
    
  In connection with the 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program ("TARP"), the Company issued   1,707,456   warrants to purchase common stock at an exercise price of   $17.57  .  In September 2016, the Company repurchased   892,240   of these warrants with a value of   $7,718,158  . Warrants remaining outstanding were   808,616   as of   September 30, 2016   and   1,700,856   as of   September 30, 2015  , and they have an expiration date of November 14, 2018.  The outstanding warrants are considered in the calculation of diluted shares outstanding using the treasury stock method.

  The management of Washington Federal, Inc. (the "Company") is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  The Company's internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company's management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. 
  The Company's management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of   September 30, 2016  .  In making this assessment, the Company's management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in the 2013 version of its Internal Control-Integrated Framework.  Based on its assessment, the Company's management believes that as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. 
  The Company's independent auditors, Deloitte   Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, have issued an audit report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting and their report follows.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
    
  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
  Washington Federal, Inc. 
  Seattle, Washington 
    
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of Washington Federal, Inc. and subsidiaries (the  Company ) as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended   September 30, 2016  . These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
    
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
    
  In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Washington Federal, Inc. and subsidiaries as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended   September 30, 2016  , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
    
  We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of   September 30, 2016  , based on the criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated   November 21, 2016   expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
  Washington Federal, Inc. 
  Seattle, Washington 
    
  We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Washington Federal, Inc. and subsidiaries (the  Company ) as of   September 30, 2016  , based on criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Because management s assessment and our audit were conducted to meet the reporting requirements of Section 112 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA), management s assertion and our audit of the Company s internal control over financial reporting included controls over the preparation of the schedules equivalent to the basic financial statements in accordance with the instructions for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Instructions for Call Reports for Balance Sheet on schedule RC, Income Statement on schedule RI, and Changes in Bank Equity Capital on schedule RI-A. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report s on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
    
  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
    
  A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
    
  Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
    
  In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of   September 30, 2016  , based on the criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
    
  We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended   September 30, 2016  , of the Company and our report dated   November 21, 2016  , expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
