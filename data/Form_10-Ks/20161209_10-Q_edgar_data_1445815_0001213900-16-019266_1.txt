   NOTES
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

   (UNAUDITED)   

Note
1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Basis
of Presentation   

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on substantially the same basis as the audited financial statements included
in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally
included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and regulations regarding interim
financial statements. All amounts included herein related to the financial statements as of September 30, 2016 and the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the
notes there to included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

In
the opinion of management, the accompanying financial statements include all necessary adjustments for the fair presentation of
the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The results of operations for the interim periods
presented are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for any subsequent interim period or for the
full fiscal year ending December 31, 2016.  

U.S.
Rare Earth Minerals, Inc. was incorporated in the state of Nevada on September 9, 2008.  

As
used in these Notes to the Financial Statements, the terms the  Company ,  we ,  us ,  our 
and similar terms refer to U. S. Rare Earth Minerals, Inc.  

Going
Concern   

The accompanying financial statements
have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate continuation of the Company
as a going concern. To date, the Company has generated minimal revenue and has a working capital deficiency of $290,048 as of
September 30, 2016. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded
asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty. We will need to raise funds
or implement our business plan to continue operations.  

In
order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s
plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses by seeking
equity and/or debt financing. However management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing
any of its plans.  

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon among other things; its ability to successfully accomplish
the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually begin operations in accordance with its business plan. The accompanying
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  

4  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

From
time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard setting bodies
that may have an impact on the Company s accounting and reporting. The Company believes that such recently issued accounting
pronouncements and other authoritative guidance for which the effective date is in the future will not have an impact on its accounting
or reporting or that such impact will not be material to its financial position, results of operations and cash flows when implemented.

Note 6. Revision of Previously Issued
Financial Statements  

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company identified errors in its financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 financial
statements. The $236,362 write off of the related party payable balance of $236,362 in September 30, 2015 was accounted for
as a gain on accounts payable and was corrected to post to additional paid-in capital. 

The Company assessed the effect of the below errors in the
aggregate on prior periods  financial statements in accordance with the SEC s Staff Accounting Bulletins No. 99 and
108 and, based on an analysis of quantitative and qualitative factors, determined that the errors were not material to any of the
Company s prior interim and annual financial statements. 

The Company determined that the correction of the cumulative
amounts of the errors would be material to its financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Therefore,
the Company revised its previously-issued financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

All financial information contained in the accompanying notes
to these financial statements has been revised to reflect the correction of these errors. 

For the nine months ended September
30, 2015 revised income statement, the gain of $236,362 as reported on the September 30, 2015 income statement was changed to zero
causing the net loss to change from $1,748,813 as reported on the September 30, 2015 income statement to $832,035 in the revised
September 30, 2015 financial statement. For the three months ended September 30, 2015 revised income statement, the gain of $236,362
as reported on the September 30, 2015 income statement was changed to zero causing the net gain of $206,249 as reported on the
September 30, 2015 income statement to change to a net loss of $30,113 in the revised September 30, 2015 financial statement. For
the nine months ended September 30, 2015 revised cash flow, the net loss of $1,748,813 as reported on September 30, 2015 cash flow
was revised to $1,985,175 and the gain of $236,362 was revised to zero. 

Note 7. Subsequent Events  

6,000,000 shares were granted, only
3,000,000 shares were issued as of September 30, 2016, to a related party. In November 2016, these shares were refused by the related
party and were cancelled by the company in the subsequent period.

ITEM 2.     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND PLAN
OF OPERATION  

The following discussion should be
read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements and the notes thereto.   

Forward-Looking Statements   

This quarterly report contains forward-looking
statements and information relating to us that are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by, and information
currently available to, our management. When used in this report, the words  believe,   anticipate,   expect, 
 estimate,   intend ,  plan  and similar expressions, as they relate to us or our management,
are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements reflect management's current view of us concerning future
events and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including among many others: a general economic downturn;
a downturn in the securities markets; federal or state laws or regulations having an adverse effect on proposed transactions that
we desire to effect; Securities and Exchange Commission regulations which affect trading in the securities of  penny stocks, 
and other risks and uncertainties. Should any of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove
incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described in this report as anticipated, estimated or expected. All forward-looking
statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statement. 

Overview   

U.S. Rare Earth Minerals, Inc. (the  Company ), primary focus is on sales and distribution of
certain products derived from the Company s mining activities relating to natural mineral deposits commonly known as Calcium
Montmorillonite. These activities will be carried out through a web-based and distributor-based sales program directed at agricultural,
animal and human uses of the products. To that end, the company has added one international distributor and two domestic distributors. 

To the extent that the company requires
additional capital for operations that it cannot derive from profits from sales, the Company plans to sell additional shares of
unregistered preferred stock to raise money for additional operating capital. There is no guarantee the Company will be successful
in selling additional shares to raise funds for additional operating capital, or if successful, it will raise the desired amount
or be on terms and conditions which are beneficial to the Company. 

Plan of Operation   

The Company markets and sells the product
extracted in the mining process under the name  EXCELERITE  . The Company believes that EXCELERITE  has broad
applications for plants, animals and humans. Specifically, the Company believes that by adding EXCELERITE  back into the soil,
household and commercial farmers are replacing what has been lost by the use of man-made fertilizers over hundreds of years. Farmers
using EXCELERITE  are seeing higher yields and larger and more nutritious crops. In addition, studies suggest that animals
whose feed is supplemented with EXCELERITE  grow healthier and produce more. The naturally chelated nutrients and minerals
in EXCELERITE  may enhance the production of enzymes. Without enzymes living things cannot build protein and other vital processes.
 Micro-Excelerite   , a supplement form of EXCELERITE  is believed to rejuvenate the health of the human
body in many ways. In addition to its natural supply of 78 essential nutrients and minerals, its ionic charge removes toxins as
it works through the digestive tract. 

The Company is marketing its products through various channels including but not limited to direct distribution,
sales through third-party distributors and sales through the Company s website. The Company has also undertaken to develop
a network of distributors, both in the United States and internationally. The Company s directors have been marketing the
product to agricultural customers throughout the United States and internationally as well. King Faisal University in Rijahd, Saudi
Arabia has just  informed
us they have arranged for the University s Agricultural and Veterinary Training Station to test EXCELERITE  on fish,
poultry, cucumber and goats. They will also test EXCELERITE  on diseased Date Palm and Palm Oil trees based on the reported
rejuvenation of the Palms treated with EXCELERITE  in Colombia.  

7  

The Company has been engaged in various
testing programs with several major agriculture firms for the past two years. Two of these firms are listed NYSE companies and
do business worldwide. Results of these test on strawberries, carrots, peaches, soy beans, sweet potatoes and grapes have been
very positive. EXCELERITE  has also been tested and proved to eliminate the odor from pig and cow manure which should lead
to large orders from cattle and pig farmers worldwide. The product is also being tested by poultry farmers. 

Management believes that by partnering
with these certain firms, long-term business relationships will develop, deriving substantial future product sales. The Company
is bound by certain  Non-Disclosure Agreements  and therefore cannot divulge the names of partnering companies. Announcements
of the Company s test results and identity of its partners will be forthcoming when certain test results are completed and
the parties agree on the content of the disclosure. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

The following table shows the financial
data of the statements of operations of the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS
ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015. 

The variance in the operating loss was
primarily due to shares issued for settlement of accounts payable in 2015 for an increase of operating expenses of $203,838 when
comparing the three month period ended September 30, 2016 to the same period last year. 

NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS
ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015. 

The variance in the operating loss was
primarily due to shares issued for services in 2015 for a decrease of operating expenses of $(1,181,394) when comparing the nine
month period ended September 30, 2016 to the same period last year. 

8  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   

The variance in accounts payable and
accrued expenses is primarily due to the decrease in operating expense payables. 

The accompanying financial statements
have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate continuation of the Company as
a going concern. To date, the Company has added Directors. We are proceeding to the production of the EXCELERITE    retail
products, including a new website with e-commerce capability. We will need to raise funds to implement our business plan and continue
operations. 

We believe that the level of financial
resources is a significant factor for our future development, and accordingly we may choose at any time to raise capital through
private debt or equity financing to strengthen its financial position, facilitate growth and provide us with additional flexibility
to take advantage of business opportunities. While we are presently considering a limited private offering of our securities, we
do not have immediate plans to have a public offering of our common stock and there is no guarantee that any such offering would

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

In presenting our financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported therein. Several of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently
uncertain as they pertain to future events. However, events that are outside of our control cannot be predicted and, as such, they
cannot be contemplated in evaluating such estimates and assumptions. If there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions,
it could result in a material adverse impact to our results of operations, financial position and liquidity. We believe that the
estimates and assumptions we used when preparing our financial statements were the most appropriate at that time. Presented below
are those accounting policies that we believe require subjective and complex judgments that could potentially affect reported results.
However, the majority of our businesses operate in environments where we pay a fee for a service performed, and therefore the results
of the majority of our recurring operations are recorded in our financial statements using accounting policies that are not particularly
subjective, nor complex. 

Revenue Recognition    

Revenue from the sale of product obtained
from our mining contractor is recognized when ownership passes to the purchaser at which time the following conditions are met: 

i) persuasive evidence that an agreement
exists; 

 ii) the risks and rewards of ownership
pass to the purchaser including delivery of the product; 

 iii) the selling price is fixed and
determinable; or, 

 iv) collectively is reasonably assured.

Stock Based Compensation    

The Company has share-based compensation
plans under which non-employees, consultants and suppliers may be granted restricted stock, as well as options to purchase shares
of Company common stock at the fair market value at the time of grant. Stock-based compensation cost is measured by the Company
at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award over the requisite service period. For options issued to employees, the
Company recognizes stock compensation costs utilizing the fair value methodology over the related period of benefit. Grants
of stock options and stock to non-employees and other parties are accounted for in accordance with ASC 505. 

The Company applies ASC 718 for options,
common stock and other equity-based grants to its employees and directors. ASC 718 requires measurement of all employee equity-based
payment awards using a fair-value method and recording of such expense in the consolidated financial statements over the requisite
service period.  The fair value concepts have not changed significantly in ASC 718; however, in adopting this standard,
companies must choose among alternative valuation models and amortization assumptions.  After assessing alternative valuation
models and amortization assumptions, the Company will continue using both the Black-Scholes valuation model and straight-line amortization
of compensation expense over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the grant.   

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    

We do not have any off-balance sheet
arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to
investors.
