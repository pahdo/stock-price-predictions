  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial
Statements  

1.  Nature of Operations   

Dynamic Enviro, Inc. (the  Company ),
was incorporated in the state of Florida on October 28, 2014. In January 2015, the Company assumed the principal business operations
of Dynamic Environmental, Inc., a related company with the same sole director as the Company, by continuing the principal business
while Dynamic Environmental, Inc. ceased operations of its principal business. Therefore, the Company is considered a continuation
of Dynamic Environmental, Inc. The Company s principal business is the provision of environmental and disaster response services. 

2.    Basis
of Presentation  

a)  
      Interim Financial Statements   

The interim unaudited financial statements
as of September 30, 2016, and for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information on the same basis as the annual
financial statements and in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments,
necessary to present fairly the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods shown. The results
of operations for such periods are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for a full year or for any future period.
They do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Therefore, these financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited financial statements and notes thereto for the years ended
December 31, 2015 and 2014. 

b)  
      Going Concern   

These financial statements have been
prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and
commitments in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has a working capital deficit of $45,492 as
at September 30, 2016 and has suffered net losses. The Company has funded activities to date from debt financings and earnings.
These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue
as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary
financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management
intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand and public issuance of common stock.
While the Company believes that it will be successful in obtaining the necessary financing and generating revenue to fund its operations,
meet regulatory requirements and achieve commercial goals, there are no assurances that such additional funding will be achieved
and that it will succeed in its future operations. 

3.    Property
and Equipment  

4.    Purchase
Agreement  

On September 1, 2015, the Company
entered into a Purchase Agreement to purchase a building for a price of $150,000. Per the Agreement, the Company made a down payment
$18,000 upon signing the agreement and the remaining $132,000 is due on the closing date of the Agreement. The closing date is
to be 1 year after the date of the Agreement, with an option to extend the closing date for an additional 6 months. As at September
30, 2016, the Agreement has not closed and the Company does not own the building. 

5.    Related
Party Transactions  

6.    Notes
Payable  

During the year ended December 31,
2013, the Company entered a loan agreement with a non-related third party for $32,651. The loan is unsecured, non-interest bearing
and due on demand. As of September 30, 2016, the Company owed $15,651 (December 31, 2015 - $22,151). 

7.    Stockholders 
Equity  

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company issued 480,000 shares of common stock at $0.05 per share for cash proceeds of $24,000. 

During the months ended September
30, 2016, the Company received cash proceeds of $11,000 from the collection of a subscription receivable.

30, 2016, the Company issued 200,000 shares of common stock with a fair value of $10,000 to a non-related third party as compensation

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 125,000 shares of common stock with a fair value of $6,250 to a non-related

Item 2.   Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  

This document contains  forward-looking
statements . All statements other than statements of historical fact are  forward-looking statements  for purposes
of federal and state securities laws, including, but not limited to, any projections of earnings, revenue or other financial items;
any statements of the plans, strategies and objections of management for future operations; any statements concerning proposed
new services or developments; any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance; any statements or belief; and
any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. 

Forward-looking statements may include the
words  may,   could,   estimate,   intend,   continue,   believe, 
 expect  or  anticipate  or other similar words. These forward-looking statements present our estimates
and assumptions only as of the date of this report. Except for our ongoing securities laws, we do not intend, and undertake no
obligation, to update any forward-looking statement. 

Although we believe that the expectations reflected
in any of our forward- looking statements are reasonable, actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed
in any or our forward-looking statements. Our future financial condition and results of operations, as well as any forward-looking
statements, are subject to change and inherent risks and uncertainties. The factors impacting these risks and uncertainties include,
but are not limited to: 

Our results are vulnerable to economic conditions;   

Our ability to raise adequate working capital;   

Loss of customers or sales weakness;   

Inability to achieve sales levels or other operating results;   

The unavailability of funds for capital expenditures;   

Operational inefficiencies;    

Increased competitive pressures from existing competitors and new entrants.   

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS  

Organization   

We were incorporated in the state of Florida
on October 31, 2014. We have never been the subject of a material reclassification, merger, consolidation, or purchase or sale
of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course. Further, we have never been the subject of a bankruptcy, receivership
or similar proceeding. 

Business  

Our emergency response/emergency management
services are available upon request in all 50 states. Based on our level of expertise we are commonly contracted to be present
and assist with management and execution of environmental/emergency based situations throughout the USA. We currently have one
regional service center, which is in Waveland, Mississippi and covers  from Lafayette,
Louisiana to Pensacola, Florida, which represents a 150-mile radius.  

We provide services in 4 major categories, as follows: 

(1)  
      Field and Industrial Services, i.e., above ground and underground storage tank (i.e. oil, chemical cleaning and removal)   

(2)  
      Emergency Response and Disaster Recovery, i.e., oil spills, pipeline spills, avian bird flu   

(3)  
      Waste Transportation and Disposal Services, i.e., disposal, landfill treatment, flood debris cleanup   

(4)  
      Remediation and Construction Services, including site remediation and demolition   

We intend to expand our business, as follows: 

Secure agreements for our services in the industrial corridor between Lake Charles, Louisiana to Pensacola, Florida covering Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida;   

Build stronger relationships as a premier environmental contractor by securing client agreements leading to opening additional service centers;   

Attempt to secure master service agreements with companies in need of environmental maintenance as well as an environmental responder if the need arises; and.   

Establish Service Centers strategically located to cover an approximately 100-200-mile radius.   

Service Center locations are a traditional
format for conducting the environmental services business. Each Service Center will be a base of operations to provide environmental
services for a radius of approximately 100 - 200 miles and will consist of a manager, foreman, multiple technicians, supplies and
the necessary equipment to provide the environmental services. Our current headquarters in Waveland Mississippi is an active service
center that will serve as a model for any new service centers. Our Chief Executive Officer will direct the establishment of each
Service Center. 

We plan on establishing our second Service
Center in Northern, Florida to cover the territory from Lake Charges, Louisiana and Pensacola, Florida. Because this Service Center
is contingent upon adequate funding and/or raising capital, we do not have a schedule for establishing this Service Center. Assuming
we do receive adequate funds to establish the Northern, Florida Service Center, it will take approximately 3 months to become operational. 

We intend to fund each Service Center through
existing revenues and/or raising capital or a combination of the foregoing; however, there is no assurance that we will be successful
in generating sufficient revenues or raising adequate capital.    

Trends and Uncertainties  

Our business is subject to the following
trends and uncertainties: 

The level of local, state and federal environmental regulation, which would positively or negatively affect the demand for our services;   

The level of commercial and governmental business in the United States;    

The political agenda of the Trump administration that will affect the level of environmental regulations and enforcement; and   

Whether the level of our emergency response business will materially increase or decrease.    

Going Concern  

Our financial statements have been prepared
on a going concern basis which assumes that we will be able to realize our assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments
in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. We had a working capital deficit of $45,492 at September 30, 2016
and a net loss of $71,828 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. We have funded our activities to date from debt financings
and earnings. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as
a going concern is dependent upon our generating profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to
meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Our management intends
to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand and public issuance of common stock. While we
believe that we will be successful in obtaining the necessary financing and generating revenue to fund our operations, meet regulatory
requirements and achieve commercial goals, there are no assurances that such additional funding will be achieved and that we will
succeed in our future operations. 

We will attempt to overcome the going concern
opinion by increasing our revenues, as follows: 

Expansion of our business by securing agreements for our services;   

Build stronger relationships by securing client agreements leading to opening additional service centers;   

Secure master service agreements;   

Establish a service center in Northern Florida;   

Marketing services; and   

Obtaining financing.   

Our attempt to overcome the going concern opinion
may fail since all of the above will lead to increased expenses and possible net losses. 

COMPARATIVE RESULTS FOR THE 9 MONTHS
ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 AND THE 3 MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2015  

Results of Operations: For the 9 months ended September 30, 2015
and September 30, 2016  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Revenues  

Our revenues for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $1,127,072 and $1,825,343, respectively, reflecting decreased revenues of $698,271. The $698,271
decrease in our revenues is attributable to fewer needs for our services for the 9 months ended September 30, 2015 compared to
the 9 months ended September 30, 2016. 

As an emergency response company, our revenues
have historically been contingent upon the occurrence of emergency incidents and the corresponding need for our services. Apart
from whether the level of our emergency response business will materially increase or decrease contingent upon the occurrence of
such emergency incidents, there are no known trends and uncertainties that are attributable to our decreased revenues or revenues
in the immediate future. Additionally, there have been no increased prices or introduction of new services that were factors in
our decreased revenues. 

Net Loss   

We had a net loss of $71,828 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and a net loss of $151,980 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, reflecting decreased losses of
$80,152 for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016. The 80,152 of decreased losses for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016 is
primarily attributable to decreased general and administrative expenses of $410,194 and decreased cost of sales of $361,729 for
the 9 months ended September 30, 2016. 

We had a working capital deficit of $45,492
for the fiscal 9 months ended September 30, 2016 and a working capital deficit of $17,183 for our fiscal year ended December 31,
2015 representing a $28,309 increase in working capital deficit, which is primarily attributable to an
increase of $238,788 in accounts payable, and offset by increase of $193,405 in accounts receivable during the 9 months ended September
30, 2016.  

Our net cash flows
provided by operating activities was $12,440 for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $627 for the 9 months ended
September 30, 2015, representing a $11,813 increase in cash flows provided by operating activities. 

Operating Expenses  

We incurred total operating expenses of
$412,102 and $828,092 for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, reflecting a decrease of $415,990 for the nine months
ending September 30, 2016. The primary components of this $415,990 primarily is attributable to a $410,194 decrease in general
and administrative expenses for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016 stemming from increased demand for our emergency response
services and corresponding general and administrative expenses for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016. 

Our net cash used in investing activities
were $6,000 and $0, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the increase is solely attributable to
$6,000 for purchase of property and equipment during the 9-month period ending September 30, 2016, with no entry for purchase of
property and equipment for the 9-month period ending September 30, 2015. 

Our net cash provided by financing activities
was $15,486 for the 9-month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to $21,510 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 reflecting
decreased financing activities of $6,024. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Going forward, our cash needs over the next
12 months from September 30, 2016, include the following estimated expenditures: 

4)    Lodging for our permanent
and/or part-time employees and contractors for projects beyond approximately 65 miles of our current Waveland, Mississippi service
center, $122,000  

Separate and apart from the above expenses,
we estimate that we will incur approximately $57,000 of marketing expenses that we anticipate over the next 12 months from September
30, 2016. 

These estimated expenditures are based on expenses
from fiscal year 2015 and our increased emergency response projects over the last 2 years. These numbers will be drastically affected
by whether we are successful in establishing a new service center and the volume of work; therefore, if we are unsuccessful in
establishing a new service center and/or if workload happens to decrease our expenditures will correspondingly decrease. 

We plan on meeting our cash needs, including
SEC reporting costs, by: (a) attempting to increase our revenues through increased marketing; (b) securing additional master service
agreements; and (c) obtaining financing through a debt or equity offering. 

There is no assurance that we will secure additional
capital. There currently are no agreements, arrangements, or understandings that would enable us to obtain funds through bank loans,
lines of credit, or any other source. 

Results of Operations: For the 3 months ended September 30, 2015
and September 30, 2016  

Revenues  

Our revenues for the 3-month period ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 were $432,341 and 914,631, respectively, reflecting decreased revenues of $482,290. The $482,290 of decreased
revenues is primarily attributable to a higher demand for our services and corresponding increased amount of projects for the 3
months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the 3-month period ending September 30, 2016. 

As an emergency response company, our revenues
have historically been contingent upon the occurrence of emergency incidents and the corresponding need for our services. Apart
from whether the level of our emergency response business will materially increase or decrease contingent upon the occurrence of
such emergency incidents, there are no known trends and uncertainties that are attributable to our decreased revenues or are revenues
in the immediate future. Additionally, there have been no increased prices or introduction of new services that were factors in
our decreased revenues. 

Net Loss   

We had a net loss of $26,251 and $610,515
for the 3-month ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, reflecting decreased net losses of $584,264 comparing the 3-month
period ended September 30, 2015 to the three-month period ended September 30, 2016. The $584,264 decrease in net loss is primarily
attributable to a $534,322 decrease in general and administrative expenses, $531,987 decrease in cost of revenue and decreased
revenues of $482,290 for the 3 months ended September 30, 2016 when comparing the 3 months ended September 30, 2015. 

Operating Expenses  

We incurred total operating expenses of $114,074
and $649,598, respectively, for the 3-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, reflecting a decrease of $535,524 for the
3 months ended September 30, 2016. The primary components of this $535,524 decrease are primarily attributable to a $534,322 decrease
in general and administrative expenses.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and
forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the
disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment
in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 

As required by SEC Rule 15d-15(b), we carried
out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end
of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
