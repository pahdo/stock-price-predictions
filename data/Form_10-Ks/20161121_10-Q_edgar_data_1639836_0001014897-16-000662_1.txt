NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015     (UNAUDITED)         NOTE 1: ORGANIZATION, OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES        Original Source Music, Inc. ( the Company ,  we ,  us  or  our ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 20, 2009 ("Inception"). The Company licenses songs to the television and music industry for use in television shows or movies. The Company has had limited activity and revenue to date.        Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements    The accompanying financial statements of Original Source Music, Inc. have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In our opinion the financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary in order to make the financial statements not misleading. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the final results that may be expected for the year ended December 31, 2016.  For more complete financial information, these unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in our registration statement filed with the SEC.            7        Table of Contents      Basic and Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share    The Company computes earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260-10-45  Earnings per Share , which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net earnings (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period.  Diluted earnings (loss) per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.  Dilutive earnings (loss) per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had certain potentially dilutive convertible notes payable related party issued and outstanding.  However, the share potentially issuable under these notes have been excluded from the calculation of loss per share as the inclusion of such shares would have been anti-dilutive as the Company recognized a loss during the three and nine months ended September  30, 2016. No potentially debt or equity instruments were issued and outstanding during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.        Recent Accounting Pronouncements    We have reviewed all the recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and we do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the Company        NOTE 2: GOING CONCERN        The unaudited financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has suffered a loss from operations and has negative cash flows from operations, and in all likelihood will be required to make significant future expenditures in connection with marketing efforts along with general administrative expenses. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.       The Company may raise additional capital through the sale of its equity securities, through an offering of debt securities, or through borrowings from financial institutions or related parties. By doing so, the Company hopes to generate sufficient capital to execute its business plan of licensing songs to the television and music industry for use in television shows or movies on an ongoing basis. Management believes that actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern.        8        Table of Contents      NOTE 3: CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE  RELATED PARTY

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations        Forward-Looking Statements    This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements include those concerning the following:  Our intentions, beliefs and expectations regarding the fair value of all assets and liabilities recorded; our strategies; growth opportunities; product development and introduction relating to new and existing products; the enterprise market and related opportunities; competition and competitive advantages and disadvantages; industry standards and compatibility of our products; relationships with our employees; our facilities, operating lease and our ability to secure additional space; cash dividends; excess inventory, our expenses; interest and other income; our beliefs and expectations about our future success and results; our operating results; our belief that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements, our expectations regarding our revenues and customers; investments and interest rates.  These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially.       The Company undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Form 10-Q.        Critical Accounting Policies    The financial statements and accompanying footnotes included in this report has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States with certain amounts based on management s best estimates and judgments. To determine appropriate carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources, management uses assumptions based on historical results and other factors they believe are reasonable.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.       Our critical accounting policies are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies as of and for the three months ended September 30, 2016.        Trends and Uncertainties    Demand for the Company's products is dependent on general economic conditions, which are cyclical in nature.  Because a major portion of our activities are the receipt of revenues from our music licensing services, our business operations may be adversely affected by competitors and prolonged recessionary periods.            14        Table of Contents     There are no other known trends, events or uncertainties that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our short term or long term liquidity.  Sources of liquidity will come from sales of our products and services.  There are no material commitments for capital expenditure at this time.  There are no trends, events or uncertainties that have had or are reasonably expected to have a material impact on the net sales or revenues or income from continuing operations.  There are no significant elements of income or loss that do not arise from the Company s continuing operations.  There are no other known causes for any material changes from period to period in one or more line items of our financial statements.          Capital and Sources of Liquidity        We have $576 in cash as of September 30, 2016.  Based on our current income and expenses, we estimate that we will require an annual average of $32,000 in capital to continue operations.  With our current cash supply, we do not have sufficient funds to continue operations.  We have access to funding of up to $96,000 through related party loans, and utilizing current estimates.  These loans are not guaranteed.  We have no guarantee that we will generate sufficient revenues to continue operations beyond that estimate.       For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a net loss of $24,043.  We had a positive adjustment of $13,102 due to the amortization of debt discount and $764 due to accrued interest to a related party.  We had a negative change of $5,702 due to accrued expenses.  As a result, we had net cash used in operating activities of $15,879 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

As a result, we had net cash used in operating activities of $15,264 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.       For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we did not pursue any investing activities.       For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we received $17,117 from an advance under convertible notes payable from a related party. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we spent $2,500 on the repayment of Note H, resulting in net cash provided by financing activities of $14,617 for the period.       For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we received $15,260 from an advance under convertible notes payable from a related party, resulting in net cash provided by financing activities of $15,260 for the period.            15        Table of Contents      Results of Operations        For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded revenues of $50.  We incurred general and administrative expenses of $951 and professional fees of $1,800.  We had interest expense to a related party of $6,177.

The $1,401 difference between the net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily the result of an increased interest expense to a related party.

We paid general and administrative expenses of $1,206 and professional fees of $9,215.  We had interest expense to a related party of $13,866.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our CEO and CFO, or the persons performing similar functions, our management has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO, or the persons performing similar functions, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016.        Evaluation of Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting:        Under the supervision and with the participation of our CEO and CFO, or those persons performing similar functions, our management has evaluated changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the first quarter of 2016.  Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO, or those persons performing similar functions, did not identify any change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.        Important Considerations:        The effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of human error, and the risk of fraud. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time. Because of these limitations, there can be no assurance that any system of disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management.        17        Table of Contents       PART II  - OTHER INFORMATION         Item 1.
