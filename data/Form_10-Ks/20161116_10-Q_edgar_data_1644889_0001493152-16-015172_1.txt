   NOTES
TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE
1    ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS    

BIM
Homes, Inc. ( the Company ,  we ,  us ,  our  or  the Issuer ) was
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on March 6, 2014. The Company was established as part of the Chapter 11 reorganization
of Pacific Shores Development, Inc. ( PSD ). Under PSD s Plan of Reorganization, as confirmed by the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court for the Southern District of California, the Company was incorporated to: (1) receive and own the interest which PSD had
in a development business which focused on the construction of low cost homes; and (2) issue shares of its common stock to PSD s
general unsecured creditors and its administrative creditors. The Company has been in the development stage since its formation
and has not yet realized any revenues from its planned operations. The Company is currently searching for business opportunities
and is seeking an existing company which we could acquire, merge with, or joint venture with.  

NOTE
2    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

Basis
of presentation   

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America ( GAAP ). The unaudited financial statements for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared by us without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to present fairly our financial position, results of operations,
and cash flows as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, and for the periods then ended, have been made. Those adjustments consist of
normal and recurring adjustments.  

Risks
and uncertainties for development stage company   

We
are considered to be in the development stage as defined in the accounting standards since we have not commenced planned principal
operations. Our activities since inception include devoting substantially all of our efforts to searching for business opportunities.
Additionally, we have allocated a substantial portion of our time and investment to seeking an existing company which we could
acquire, merge with or joint venture with. We have not yet generated any revenue from operations. The Company s activities
during the development stage are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.  

Going
concern   

These
unaudited financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates,
among other things, the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course   of
business.  

As
reflected in the accompanying unaudited financial statements, the Company had a net loss of $38,427 and $6,161 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and net cash used in operations of $42,793 and $6,160 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and an accumulated deficit and stockholders  equity of $52,576 and $3,152, respectively,
at September 30, 2016, and did not generate any revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These matters raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern
is dependent on the Company s ability to raise additional capital, implement its business plan, and generate significant
revenues. The Company has been funded by working advances from related parties. The Company s future operations are dependent
upon external funding and its ability to execute its business  .  

The
unaudited financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as
a going concern. The Company plans on raising capital through the sale of equity or debt instruments to implement its business
plan. There is no assurance these plans will be realized  .  

Use
of estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates  .  

Cash
and cash equivalents   

Cash
and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions
and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments  .

NOTE
2    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)    

Basic
loss per common share   

Basic
 income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by weighted average number
of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income
(loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities
outstanding during the period. All potentially dilutive common shares were excluded from the computation of diluted shares outstanding
as they would have an anti-dilutive impact on the Company s net losses and consisted of the following :  

Income
tax   

Deferred
income tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and
liabilities, as measured by the enacted tax rates, which are expected to be in effect when these differences reverse. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are classified as current or non-current, depending upon the classification of the asset or liabilities
to which they relate. Deferred tax assets and liabilities not related to an asset or liability are classified as current or non-current
depending on the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when
necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized  .  

The
Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC 740-10  Uncertainty in Income Taxes  (ASC 740-10). Certain recognition
thresholds must be met before a tax position is recognized in the financial statements. An entity may only recognize or continue
to recognize tax positions that meet a  more-likely-than-not  threshold  .  

The
Company does not believe it has any uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 that would require either recognition
or disclosure in the accompanying unaudited financial statement  s.  

Stock-based
compensation   

Stock-based
compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment Topic of ASC 718 which requires recognition
in the financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments
over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting
period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based
on the grant-date fair value of the   award.  

Pursuant
to ASC Topic 505-50, for share-based payments to consultants and other third-parties, compensation expense is determined at the
 measurement date.  The expense is recognized over the service period of the award. Until the measurement date is
reached, the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain. The Company initially records compensation expense based
on the fair value of the award at the reporting date  .  

Recently
issued accounting pronouncements   

Management
 does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements,
if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying unaudited financial statements .  

NOTE
3    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS    

Related
party convertible loans   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and during fiscal 2015, the former chief executive officer of the Company advanced a
total of $17,335 and $13,140 to the Company to cover expenses, respectively. In connection with these advances, the Company issued
the former chief executive officer convertible notes totaling $27,225 and the Company received additional advances of $3,250 during
the three months ended June 30, 2016. These notes had a term of three years, non-interest bearing, and were convertible into one
share of common stock per $0.01 of loan principal. On May 13, 2016, the former chief executive officer of the Company agreed to
cancel all debt owed to him. In connection with this cancellation, the cancelled debt was reflected as a contribution of capital
by the former officer and accordingly, reduced the loan amounts due by $30,475 and increased paid-in capital by $30,475. At September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 convertible notes   related party amounted to $0 and $13,140, respectively.

3    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (continued)    

Due
to related party

common stock and warrants to purchase 2,500,000 shares of the Company s common stock, resulting in a change of control of
the Company. Armada Enterprises GP, LLC ( Armada ) purchased 2,000,000 shares of common stock, representing 76.0%
of the Company s outstanding common stock, and 2,005,000 warrants to purchase shares of common stock in these transactions.
The Company s chief executive officer, Milan Saha serves as Armada s Chief General Counsel. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, Armada advanced the Company $15,202 for working capital purposes and the Company repaid Armada $14,734.
The advances bear no interest, are unsecured and are payable on demand. At September 30, 2016, the Company owed Armada $468 which
is reflected as due to related party on the accompanying balance sheet.  

NOTE
4    STOCKHOLDERS  DEFICIT

are authorized.  

Preferred

The
Company has authorized 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock with $0.0001 par value per share. As of September 30, 2016 no shares

shares of its common stock to Joseph LeBlanc; 5,000 restricted shares of its common stock to Gluten Balaban Ugandan; and 5,000
restricted shares of its common stock to Muzeyyen Balaban. All of these issuances were for services valued at a nominal value
of $0.0001 per share.  

On
September 12, 2016, the Company issued 4,165 shares of its common stock upon exercise of 4,165 warrants for cash proceeds of $24,990.  

Warrants   

On
August 19, 2016, the Company entered into a series of warrant amendment agreements (collectively, the  Warrant Amendments )
in order to extend the expiration date of certain outstanding warrants from August 30, 2016 to August 30, 2017. The Company analyzed
the incremental value of the modified warrants as compared to the original warrant value, both valued as of the modification date,
The Company determined there was no warrant modification expense as the warrants had nominal value. The warrants subject to the
term extension were valued using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model and the following weighted average assumptions:  

Warrant
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are summarized as follows:

5    CONCENTRATIONS    

The
Company has relied on related party working capital loans and advances to fund its operations.  

NOTE
6    SUBSEQUENT EVENTS    

On October 1, 2016, the Company entered into
a revolving line of credit agreement (the  Line of Credit ) with Deonarayan P. Saha, the father of the Company s
chief executive officer (the  Lender ). The Lender established a revolving line of credit in the Company s favor
in the amount of Twenty Thousand Dollars ($20,000), in the form of approved charges on two of the Lender s credit cards.
The Lender may cancel either or both of these credit cards at any time. At any time that the Company desires the Lender make a
charge against a credit card, the Company may request the same, and the Lender for any or no reason may deny such request. The
line of credit advances made will not bear interest if the Company pays off the balance on the credit cards when a monthly payment
is due, and the Company will pay the interest on the credit cards on the amount of any unpaid balance on the credit cards for
the Company s charges against the credit cards. Through November 10, 2016, the Company borrowed approximately $14,807 under
this Line of Credit and repaid $14,807. 

On
November 4, 2016, the Company entered into a 12% convertible promissory note payable (the  Convertible Note ) with
a principal amount of $100,000. Principal and all accrued interest payable is due on November 4, 2017. The holder of the Convertible
Note has an option to convert all or any portion of the accrued interest and unpaid principal balance of the Convertible Note
into the common stock of the Company at 25% of the average of the lowest three trading day prices for the common stock during
the ten trading days prior to the conversion date. Additionally, upon the conversion of the Convertible Note, the Company shall
issue to the holder on the conversion date a number of additional shares of common stock equal to (i) 10% of the principal amount
converted divided by (ii) the lower of (a) $1.00 or (b) the average of the lowest three trading prices for the common stock during
the ten trading day period prior to the conversion date. The Company shall have no right of prepayment. The Convertible Note is
secured by all of the Company s assets and is guaranteed by Armada Enterprises GP, LLC, the majority shareholder of the
Company. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic No. 815, the embedded conversion option does not meet the definition of a derivative
since the common shares underlying the conversion option are not readily convertible to cash because there is an inactive market
for the Company s common stock.  

On
October 28, 2016, the Company s board of directors approved of a plan for conversion of the Company from a corporation to
a publicly traded limited partnership. It is anticipated that the Company, upon becoming a publicly traded limited partnership,
will be managed by Armada Enterprises GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (currently the majority shareholder of the
Company), as the Company s general partner. The Company has begun implementation of its plans to convert the Company from
a corporation to a publicly traded limited partnership.

6, 2014 as part of the implementation of the Chapter 11 plan of reorganization of Pacific Shores Development, Inc. ( PSD ).
PSD had been in the residential real estate development business and the predecessor of the issuer was a subsidiary of PSD engaged
in the development of low cost single family homes on in-fill lot sites. Under PSD s Plan of Reorganization the Company
was incorporated to: (1) receive and own the interest which PSD had in the development business which focused on the construction
of low cost homes; and (2) issue shares of its common stock to PSD s general unsecured creditors and its administrative
creditors. While it remains possible that management will find opportunities for the Company in the low cost residential construction
industry, management is currently engaged in a search for a business to enter or an existing company which it can acquire, merge
with, or joint venture with, and this search is not limited to the real estate development and construction industry.  

Results
of Operations   

The
Company has not yet realized any revenues or earnings from operations however, as noted above, it incurs ongoing expenses related
to its SEC registration and status as a reporting issuer. We will, in all likelihood, continue to sustain operating expenses without
corresponding revenues, at least until we can complete a business combination with another company.  

Going
Concern   

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements are presented on a going concern basis. The company s financial condition raises
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has no cash and no other material
assets and it has no operations or revenues from operations. It is relying on advances from officers, directors, related parties
and third parties to meet its limited operating expenses.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As
of September 30, 2016, we had $4,306 in assets, $1,154 in liabilities and an accumulated deficit of $52,576. As of December 31,
2015 we had no assets and we had liabilities totaling $13,890 and we had an accumulated deficit of $14,149. Our only expenses
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were for professional, and general and administrative expenses which totaled $38,427.
We had no revenues during the period. We will, in all likelihood, sustain continued operating expenses without corresponding revenues,
at least until we can complete a business combination with another company.  

We
will continue to depend upon shareholders, officers, and directors to make loans to the Company to meet any costs that may occur.
All such advances will be interest-free.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, working capital loans from our former chief executive officer amounted to $17,335. On
May 13, 2016, the former chief executive officer of the Company agreed to cancel all debt owed to him. In connection with this
cancellation, the cancelled debt was reflected as a contribution of capital by the former officer and accordingly, reduced the
loan amounts due by $30,475 and increased paid-in capital by $30,475.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Armada Enterprises GP, LLC ( Armada ), our majority shareholder, advanced
the Company $15,202 for working capital purposes and the Company repaid Armada $14,734. The advanced bear no interest, are unsecured
and are payable on demand, At September 30, 2016, we owed Armada $468 which is reflected as due to related party on the accompanying
balance sheet.  

On
October 1, 2016, we entered into a revolving line of credit agreement (the  Line of Credit ) with Deonarayan P. Saha,
the father of the Company s chief executive officer (the  Lender ). The Lender established a revolving line
of credit in our favor in the amount of $20,000, in the form of approved charges on two of the Lender s credit cards. The
Lender may cancel either or both of these credit cards at any time. At any time that we desire the Lender make a charge against
a credit card, we may request the same, and the Lender for any or no reason may deny such request. The line of credit advances
made will not bear interest if we pay off the balance on the credit cards when a monthly payment is due, and we will pay the interest
on the credit cards on the amount of any unpaid balance on the credit cards for our charges against the credit cards. Through
November 10, 2016, we borrowed approximately $14,807 under this Line of Credit and repaid $14,807.  

On
November 4, 2016, we entered into a 12% convertible promissory note payable (the  Convertible Note ) with a principal
amount of $100,000. Principal and all accrued interest payable is due on November 4, 2017. The holder of the Convertible Note
has an option to convert all or any portion of the accrued interest and unpaid principal balance of the Convertible Note into
the common stock of the Company at 25% of the average of the lowest three trading day prices for the common stock during the ten
trading days prior to the conversion. Additionally, upon the conversion of the Convertible Note, we shall issue to the holder
on the conversion date a number of additional shares of common stock equal to (i) 10% of the principal amount converted divided
by (ii) the lower of (a) $1.00 or (b) the average of the lowest three trading prices for the common stock during the ten trading
day period prior to the conversion date. We shall have no right of prepayment. The Convertible Note is secured by all of the Company s
assets and is guaranteed by Armada Enterprises GP, LLC, the majority shareholder of the Company. Pursuant to ASC Topic 470-20-525
(Debt with conversion and other options), since this convertible note had fixed conversion percentages of 25% of the stock price,
we determined it had a fixed maximum amounts that can be settled for the debt. Accordingly, on November 4, 2016, we recorded an
embedded conversion option liability amounting to $300,000 since the Convertible Note is convertible for the conversion premium
and recorded interest expense of $300,000. Upon conversion, the embedded conversion option liability of will be reclassified to
additional paid-in capital.  

Contractual
Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

Contractual
Obligations    

As
of September 30, 2016, we have no fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements    

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources that is material to investors.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited and unaudited financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation
of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates, including
those related to income taxes, and the valuation of equity transactions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on
various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Any future changes
to these estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting
policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the unaudited financial statements.  

Stock-based
compensation   

Stock-based
compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment Topic of ASC 718 which requires recognition
in the financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments
over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting
period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based
on the grant-date fair value of the award.  

Pursuant
to ASC Topic 505-50, for share-based payments to consultants and other third-parties, compensation expense is determined at the
 measurement date.  The expense is recognized over the service period of the award. Until the measurement date is
reached, the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain. We initially record compensation expense based on the fair
value of the award at the reporting date.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material
effect on the accompanying financial statements.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures   

Our
management, with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
for the same reasons that our internal control over financial reporting were not adequate.  

Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting   

As
indicated in our Form 10-K filed on March 11, 2016, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective during the 2015 fiscal year at the reasonable assurance level,
as a result of a material weakness primarily related to a lack of a sufficient number of personnel with appropriate training and
experience in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP.  

We
are currently in the process of evaluating the steps necessary to remediate this material weakness.  

Changes
in Internal Control   

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

We
believe that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives
of the control system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances
of fraud, if any, within any company have been detected.
