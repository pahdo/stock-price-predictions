    NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS     

             This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for ContraVir Pharmaceuticals Inc. may contain forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward-looking statements are characterized by
future or conditional verbs such as "may," "will," "expect," "intend," "anticipate," believe," "estimate" and "continue" or similar words. You should read statements that contain these words carefully
because they discuss future expectations and plans, which contain projections of future results of operations or financial condition or state other forward-looking information. Such statements are
only predictions and our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. We believe that it is important to communicate future expectations to
investors. However, there may be events in the future that we are not able to accurately predict or control. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed
under Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in the audited financial statements as of and for the period ended June 30, 2016 contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K
("Form 10-K") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on September 28, 2016. These factors include the uncertainties associated with product development, the risk that
products that appeared promising in early clinical trials do not demonstrate safety and efficacy in larger-scale clinical trials, the risk that we will not obtain approval to market our products, the
risks associated with dependence upon key personnel and the need for additional financing. We do not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements as circumstances change and thus you
should not unduly rely on these statements.

1. Business Overview     

ContraVir Pharmaceuticals Inc. ("ContraVir" or the "Company") is a biopharmaceutical company focused primarily on the clinical development of FV-100 to treat herpes zoster (HZ),
or shingles, which is an infection caused by the reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV) or "chickenpox", and CMX157 to treat Hepatitis B (HBV).   

          On
June 10, 2016, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary now known as ContraVir Research Inc., acquired Ciclofilin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. a biopharmaceutical
company incorporated on January 13, 2014 in California and reincorporated in Delaware on October 15, 2014. Ciclofilin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. had one wholly-owned subsidiary,
Ciclofilin Pharmaceuticals Corp., incorporated in Canada on January 24, 2014. Together, Ciclofilin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Ciclofilin Pharmaceuticals Corp ("Ciclofilin") are a
wholly-owned subsidiary known as ContraVir Research Inc. that specializes in the development of cyclophilin inhibitors, an emerging class of drugs for infectious, inflammatory, and degenerative
diseases. Ciclofilin's lead drug candidate, CRV431, is a potent cyclophilin inhibitor that blocks multiple HBV activities including entry into cells and replication, and is currently in pre-clinical
development.   

2. Basis of Presentation and Going Concern     

These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared following the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and United States generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for interim reporting. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, which
include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Company's interim financial information. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the audited financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2016 contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Form 10-K") filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on September 28, 2016.   

Principles of Consolidation     

          The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ContraVir and its subsidiaries ContraVir Research Inc. and Ciclofilin
Pharmaceuticals Corp, which conducts its operations in Canada. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.   

Going Concern     

          As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $3.0 million in cash. Net cash used in operating activities was $4.4 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2016. Net loss for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 was $4.8 million. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had negative working capital of $1.5 million.   

          These
unaudited financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern within one year of the issuance of these financial
statements without additional capital becoming available to attain further operating efficiencies and, ultimately, to generate revenue. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

2. Basis of Presentation and Going Concern (Continued)    

          The
Company will be required to raise additional capital within the next year to continue the development and commercialization of its current product candidate and to continue to fund
operations at its current cash expenditure levels. The Company cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Any debt financing, if available, may involve
restrictive covenants that impact the Company's ability to conduct business. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, it may have to
(i) significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and/or commercialization of its product candidate; (ii) seek collaborators for product its candidate at an earlier
stage than otherwise would be desirable and on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available; or (iii) relinquish or otherwise dispose of rights to technologies, product
candidates or products that the Company would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves on unfavorable terms.   

Use of Estimates     

          The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting
period. Changes in estimates and assumptions are reflected in reported results in the period in which they become known. Actual results could differ from those estimates.   

Significant Accounting Policies     

          The Company's significant accounting policies are disclosed in the audited financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2016 included
in the Company's Form 10-K filed with the SEC on September 28, 2016. Since the date of such financial statements, there have been no changes to the Company's significant accounting
policies.   

Cash     

          As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the amount of cash was approximately $3.0 million and $7.4 million,
respectively, consisting of checking accounts held at U.S. commercial banks. Cash is maintained at financial institutions and, at times, balances may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has
never experienced losses related to these balances.   

Fair Value of Financial Instruments     

          ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (ASC 820), establishes a fair value hierarchy for instruments measured at fair value that distinguishes
between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and the Company's own assumptions (unobservable inputs). Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the
asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in
pricing the asset or liability, and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.   

          ASC
820 identifies fair value as the exchange price, or exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between

  market
participants. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, ASC Topic 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that distinguishes among the
following:  

Level 1 Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company
has the ability to access.   
            Level 2 Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical
or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and models for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.   
            Level 3 Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.    

To
the extent that the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly,
the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. A financial instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is
based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.   

          Financial
instruments consist of cash and accounts payable. These financial instruments are stated at their respective historical carrying amounts, which approximate fair value due to
their short term nature.   

Derivative financial instruments     

          The Company has issued common stock warrants in connection with the execution of certain equity financings. The fair value of the warrants,
which were deemed to be derivative instruments based on certain contingent put features, was recorded as a derivative liability under the provisions of ASC Topic 815 Derivatives and Hedging ("ASC
815") upon issuance. Subsequently, the liability is adjusted to fair value as of the end of each reporting period and the changes in fair value of derivative liabilities are recorded in the statements
of operations under the caption "Change in fair value of derivative financial instruments warrants." See Note 4 for additional information.   

Research and Development     

          Research and development costs, which include expenditures in connection with an in-house research and development laboratory, salaries and
staff costs, application and filing for regulatory approval of proposed products, purchased in-process research and development, license costs, regulatory and scientific consulting fees, as well as
contract research, insurance and FDA consultants, are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 730, Research and Development, ("ASC 730"). Also, as prescribed by this guidance, patent filing and
maintenance expenses are considered legal in nature and therefore classified as general and administrative expense, if any.   

          ContraVir
does not currently have any commercial biopharmaceutical products, and does not expect to have such for several years if at all. Accordingly, our research and development costs
are expensed as incurred. While certain of our research and development costs may have future benefits, our policy of expensing all research and development expenditures is predicated on the fact that

2. Basis of Presentation and Going Concern (Continued)    

  ContraVir
has no history of successful commercialization of product candidates to base any estimate of the number of future periods that would be benefited.   

          Also
as prescribed by ASC 730, non-refundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities should be deferred and
capitalized. As the related goods are delivered or the services are performed, or when the goods or services are no longer expected to be provided, the deferred amounts would be recognized as an
expense. At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company had prepaid research and development costs of $411,895 and $354,542.   

Share-based payments     

          ASC Topic 718 "Compensation Stock Compensation" ("ASC 718") requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in
exchange for the award of equity instruments based on the estimated fair value of the award at the date of grant. The expense is to be recognized over the period during which an employee is required
to provide services in exchange for the award. Generally, the Company issues stock options with only service based vesting conditions and records the expense for these awards using the straight-line
method.   

          The
fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. ContraVir has a limited trading history in its common stock and
lacks company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, it estimates its expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded set of peer
companies and expects to continue to do so until such time as it has adequate historical data regarding the volatility of its own traded stock price. The expected term of the Company's stock options
has been determined utilizing the "simplified" method for awards that qualify as "plain-vanilla" options. The expected term of stock options granted to non-employees is equal to the contractual term
of the option award. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the
expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.   

          The
Company accounts for stock options issued to non-employees in accordance with ASC Topic 505-50 "Equity-Based Payment to Non-Employees" and accordingly the value of the stock
compensation to non-employees is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached, or b) at the date at which the
necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to completion of the service, the fair value of these awards is remeasured using
the then-current fair value of the Company's common stock and updated assumption inputs in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.   

          ASC
718 requires that cash flows resulting from tax deductions in excess of the cumulative compensation cost recognized for options exercised (excess tax benefits) be classified as cash
inflows
from financing activities and cash outflows from operating activities. Due to ContraVir's accumulated deficit position, no excess tax benefits have been recognized.

3. Recent Accounting Pronouncements     

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers   . This guidance requires an entity to recognize
revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or
services. This guidance also requires an entity to disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash
flows arising from contracts with customers. Qualitative and quantitative information is required about:  

Contracts with customers    including revenue and impairments recognized,
disaggregation of revenue and information about contract balances and performance obligations (including the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations).    
            Significant judgments and changes in judgments    determining the timing of
satisfaction of performance obligations (over time or at a point in time), and determining the transaction price and amounts allocated to performance obligations.    
            Certain assets    assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract.    

In
August 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance deferring the effective date of the revenue recognition standard. In March, April and May 2016, the FASB issued additional updated
guidance, which clarifies certain aspects of the ASU and the related implementation guidance issued by the FASB-IASB Joint Transition Resource Group for Revenue Recognition. This guidance is effective
for the Company for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on its results of operations,
financial position and cash flows.   

4. Business Combination     

Acquisition of Ciclofilin Pharmaceuticals, Inc.     

          On June 10, 2016, ContraVir completed its acquisition of 100% of the common stock of Ciclofilin. The transaction provided ContraVir with
a product candidate, CRV431, that is in pre-clinical stage development, targeted at treating hepatitis B. CRV431 belongs to a known drug class of cyclophilin inhibitors derived from cyclosporine A,
and was designed specifically to optimize potency and selectivity against HBV.   

          The
acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred was as follows:   

On
April 12, 2016, Ciclofilin issued $200,000 of convertible 1% Notes payable to ContraVir with a maturity date of October 12, 2016. This Note was to be repaid upon the
earlier of i) a change in

event or ii) October 12, 2016. In the event of a change of control event in which ContraVir was the acquirer, any amount due from ContraVir to Ciclofilin at closing would be
set-off by the principal amount. The Note was effectively settled upon closing of the transaction, with the settlement amount equal to the carrying amount. There was no impact to ContraVir's
consolidated statements of operations as a result of the settlement and the settlement amount is included in total consideration above.   

          The
contingent consideration represents the acquisition date fair value of potential future payments, to be paid in cash and Company stock, upon the achievement of certain milestones as
described below. The contingent consideration was estimated based on a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model, which is an income approach.

transaction was accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed were recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition, with the remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill. The goodwill recognized is attributable primarily to strategic
opportunities related to leveraging Tribute's existing infrastructure. Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.

4. Business Combination (Continued)     

The following table summarizes the estimated preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:   

There
were no measurement period adjustments recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2016.   

Acquired In-Process Research and Development      

Acquired IPR D is the estimated fair value of the CRV431 asset at the acquisition date. The Company determined that the estimated fair value of
CRV431 was $3,190,000 as of the acquisition date using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method, or MPEEM, which is a form of the income approach. Under the MPEEM, the fair value of an intangible asset
is equal to the present value of the asset's projected incremental after-tax cash flows (excess earnings) remaining after deducting the market rates of return on the estimated value of contributory
assets (contributory charge) over its remaining useful life.   

          To
calculate fair value of CRV431 under the MPEEM, the Company used probability-weighted, projected cash flows discounted at a rate considered appropriate given the significant inherent
risks associated with drug development by clinical-stage companies. Cash flows were calculated based on estimated projections of revenues and expenses related to CRV431 and then reduced by a
contributory charge on requisite assets employed. Contributory assets included working capital, net fixed assets and assembled workforce. Rates of return on the contributory assets were based on rates
used for comparable market participants. Cash flows were assumed to extend through 2040. The resultant cash flows were then discounted to present value using a weighted-average cost of capital for
companies with profiles substantially similar to that of ContraVir, which the Company believes represent the rate that market participants would use to value the assets. The Company compensated for
the phase of development of the program by applying a probability factor to the estimation of the expected future cash flows. The projected cash flows were based on significant assumptions, including
the indication in which development of CRV431 will be pursued, the time and resources needed to complete the development and regulatory approval of CRV431, estimates of revenue and operating profit
related to the program considering its stage of development, the life of the potential commercialized product, market penetration and competition, and risks associated with achieving
commercialization, including

or failure to obtain regulatory approvals to conduct clinical studies, failure of clinical studies, delay or failure to obtain required market clearances, and intellectual property litigation.   

Deferred Income Tax Liability      

The Company recorded a $1,269,620 deferred income tax liability resulting from the acquisition reflecting the tax impact of the difference
between the book basis and tax basis of acquired IPR D. Such deferred income tax liability cannot be used to offset deferred tax assets when analyzing the Company's valuation allowance as the acquired
IPR D is considered to have an indefinite life until the Company completes or abandons development of CRV431.   

5. Stockholder's Equity and Derivative Liability     

Preferred stock, Common Stock and Warrant Offering     

          On October 14, 2014, the Company closed a private offering of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Series A") and
issued 900,000 shares of Series A preferred at $10.00 per share, generating gross proceeds of approximately $9,000,000. The Company also granted the purchaser the option to purchase up to an
additional 350,000 shares of Series A prior to February 28, 2015. The Series A are classified as permanent equity in accordance with ASC Topic 480,     Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.   
The Company issued an additional 50,000 shares of Series A preferred at $10.00 per share on
December 23, 2014, an additional 30,000 shares of Series A preferred at $10.00 per share on February 10, 2015 and an additional 270,000 shares on February 26, 2015,
resulting in the issuance of a total of $1.25 million shares of Series A Preferred stock generating aggregate gross proceeds of $12.5 million. Further, on December 17,
2014, the Company licensed CMX157 from Chimerix in exchange for an upfront payment of 120,000 shares of our Series B Preferred stock valued at $1.2 million.   

          During
the period from August 5, 2016 to September 29, 2016, certain holders of the Company's Series A Convertible Preferred Stock elected to convert approximately
1.1 million shares of Series A Convertible Preferred stock into approximately 22.2 million shares of the Company's common stock. In addition, in September 2016, the holder of the
Company's Series B Convertible Preferred stock elected to convert the outstanding 120,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred stock into approximately 1.1 million shares of
the Company's common stock   

          On
October 7, 2015, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement related to the public offering and sale of 5,000,000 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to
3,000,000 shares of common stock, at a fixed combined price to the public of $3.00 under the Company's current shelf registration statement on Form S-3. The shares of common stock and warrants
were issued separately on October 13, 2015. The warrants are immediately exercisable and will be exercisable for a period of five years from the date of issuance at an exercise price of $4.25
per share. There is not, nor is there expected to be, any trading market for the warrants issued in the offering contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement. The Company also granted the Underwriters a
45-day option to purchase up to an additional 750,000 additional shares of common stock and additional warrants to purchase up to 450,000 shares of common stock at $3.00, which was not exercised. The
gross proceeds to the Company were $15 million, before deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses payable by the Company of approximately $1.5 million. If the
warrants were exercised in full, ContraVir would receive additional proceeds of approximately $12.8 million.

5. Stockholder's Equity and Derivative Liability (Continued)    

If
the Company consummates any merger, consolidation, sale or other reorganization event in which its common stock is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash or other property
("Fundamental transaction"), then the Company shall pay at the holder's option, exercisable at any time commencing on the occurrence or the consummation of the fundamental transaction and continuing
for 90 days, an amount of cash equal to the value of the remaining unexercised portion of the warrant as determined in accordance with the Black-Scholes option pricing model on the date of such
fundamental transaction. As a result of these terms, in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC Topic 815-40, the Company has determined that the warrants issued in connection with this
financing transaction must be recorded as derivative liabilities upon issuance and marked to market on a quarterly basis in the Company's statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Upon the
issuance of these warrants, the fair value of approximately $4.4 million was recorded as derivative financial instruments liability warrants.   

          The
fair value of these liability classified warrants were estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company develops its own assumptions for use in the Black-Scholes
option pricing model that do not have observable inputs or available market data to support the fair value. This method of valuation involves using inputs such as the fair value of the Company's
common stock, stock price volatility of comparable companies, the contractual term of the warrants, risk free interest rates and dividend yields. The Company has a limited trading history in its
common stock, therefore, expected volatility is based on that of comparable public development stage biotechnology companies. Due to the nature of these inputs, the valuation of the warrants is
considered a Level 3 measurement.   

          The
following assumptions were used to measure the warrants at issuance and to remeasure the liability as of September 30, 2016:   

On
April 4, 2016, the Company closed on a public offering of 4,929,578 shares of its common stock and warrants to purchase up to 2,464,789 shares of common stock, at a fixed
combined price to the public of $1.42 under the Company's current shelf registration statement on Form S-3. The warrants are immediately exercisable and will be exercisable for a period of five
years from the date of issuance at an exercise price of $1.70 per share. There is not, nor is there expected to be, any trading market for the warrants issued in the offering contemplated by the
Underwriting Agreement. The gross proceeds to the Company were $7.0 million, before deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses payable by the Company of approximately
$0.7 million. If the warrants were exercised in full, ContraVir would receive additional proceeds of approximately $4.2 million.   

          Similar
to the terms of the warrants issued in October 2015, if the Company consummates any merger, consolidation, sale or other reorganization event in which its common stock is
converted into or exchanged for securities, cash or other property ("Fundamental transaction"), then the Company shall pay at the holder's option, exercisable at any time commencing on the occurrence
or the consummation of the fundamental transaction and continuing for 90 days, an amount of cash equal to

value of the remaining unexercised portion of the warrant as determined in accordance with the Black-Scholes option pricing model on the date of such fundamental transaction. As a result of these
terms, in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC Topic 815-40, the Company has determined that the warrants issued in connection with this financing transaction must be recorded as derivative
liabilities upon issuance and marked to market on a quarterly basis in the Company's statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Upon the issuance of these warrants, the fair value of
approximately $1.5 million was recorded as derivative financial instruments liability warrants.   

          The
fair value of these liability classified warrants were estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company develops its own assumptions for use in the Black-Scholes

Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement     

          On March 9, 2015, the Company entered into a Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement (the "Agreement"), with Cantor
Fitzgerald   Co., as sales agent ("Cantor"), pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, through Cantor shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.0001
per share (the "Shares"), up to an aggregate offering price of $50.0 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from these sales to fund research and development activities, including
the Phase 3 clinical trial of FV-100, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes, and possible acquisitions of other companies, products or technologies, though no such
acquisitions are currently contemplated.

5. Stockholder's Equity and Derivative Liability (Continued)    

          Under
the Agreement, Cantor may sell the Shares by methods deemed to be an "at-the-market" offering as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Securities Act"), including sales made directly on The NASDAQ Capital Market, on any other existing trading market for the Shares or to or through a market maker. In addition, under the
Agreement, Cantor may sell the Shares by any other method permitted by law, including in privately negotiated transactions. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Cantor will use
commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with its normal trading and sales practices and applicable state and federal law, rules and regulations and the rules of The NASDAQ Capital Market, to sell
the Shares from time to time, based upon the Company's instructions (including any price, time or size limits or other customary parameters or conditions the Company may impose).   

The
Company is not obligated to make any sales of the Shares under the Agreement. The offering of Shares pursuant to the Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (1) the sale
of all of the Shares subject to the Agreement or (2) the termination of the Agreement by Cantor or the Company. ContraVir will pay Cantor a commission of up to 3.0% of the gross sales price per
share sold and has agreed to provide Cantor with customary indemnification and contribution rights.   

          As
of September 30, 2016, the Company has not made any sales under the Agreement.   

6. Fair Value Measurements     

The following table presents the Company's liabilities that are measured and recognized at fair value
on a recurring basis classified under the appropriate level of the fair value hierarchy as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016.   

The
unrealized gains or losses on the derivative liabilities are recorded as a change in fair value of derivative liabilities-warrants in the Company's statement of operations. See
Note 5 for a rollfoward of the derivative liability for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The financial instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest
level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. At each reporting period, the Company reviews the assets and liabilities that are subject to ASC 815-40. At each reporting period,
all assets and liabilities for which the fair value measurement is based on significant unobservable inputs or instruments which trade infrequently and therefore have little or no price transparency
are classified as Level 3.   

          As
discussed in Note 4, contingent consideration was recorded for the acquisition of Ciclofilin on June 10, 2016. The contingent consideration represented the acquisition
date fair value of potential future payments, to be paid in cash and Company stock, upon the achievement of certain milestones

9. Accounting for Share-Based Payments     

On June 3, 2013, ContraVir adopted the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). Stock options granted under the Plan typically will vest after three years of continuous service
from the grant date and will have a contractual term of ten years. ContraVir has reserved 6,500,000 shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the Plan. As of September 30, 2016, the Company
had 753,544 shares of common stock available for grant under the Plan.   

The
Company classifies stock-based compensation expense in its statement of operations in the same manner in which the award recipient's payroll costs are classified or in which the
award recipients' service payments are classified. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, ContraVir recorded the following stock based compensation expense:

9. Accounting for Share-Based Payments (Continued)    

          A
summary of stock option activity and of changes in stock options outstanding under the Plan for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is presented below:   

The
weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of options granted to employees during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0.72 and $3.40. The total fair
value of shares vested during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $103,597. No shares vested during the three months ended September 30, 2015. Included within the above table
are 1.4 million non-employee options outstanding as of September 30, 2016, of which 0.7 million are unvested as of September 30, 2016 and therefore subject to
remeasurement.   

          The
aggregate intrinsic value of stock options in the tables above is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the stock options and the fair value of the Company's
common stock for those stock options that had exercise prices lower than the fair value of the Company's common stock.   

          As
of September 30, 2016, the unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options outstanding, net of expected forfeitures, was approximately $2.6 million to
be recognized over a weighted-average remaining vesting period of approximately 1.45 years.   

The
following weighted-average assumptions were used in the Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate fair value of stock option awards to employees during the three months ended
September 30, 2016.   

Risk-free interest rate    Based on the daily yield curve rates for U.S. Treasury obligations with maturities which correspond to the expected term of
the Company's stock options.

9. Accounting for Share-Based Payments (Continued)    

           Dividend yield    ContraVir has not paid any dividends on common stock since its inception and does not anticipate paying dividends on its common stock
in the foreseeable future.   

            Expected volatility    Because ContraVir has a limited trading history in its common stock,
the Company based expected volatility on that of comparable public development stage biotechnology companies.   

            Expected term    The expected option term represents the period that stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding based on the simplified method
provided in SAB No. 107. Options are considered to be "plain vanilla" if they have the following basic characteristics: (i) granted "at-the-money"; (ii) exercisability is
conditioned upon service through the vesting date; (iii) termination of service prior to vesting results in forfeiture; (iv) limited exercise period following termination of service; and
(v) options are non-transferable and non-hedgeable.   

          In
December 2007, the SEC issued SAB No. 110,    Share-Based Payment   , ("SAB No. 110"). SAB No. 110 was effective
January 1, 2008 and expresses the views of the Staff of the SEC with respect to extending the use of the simplified method, as discussed in SAB No. 107, in developing an estimate of the
expected term of "plain vanilla" share options in accordance with ASC 718. The Company will use the simplified method until it has the historical data necessary to provide a reasonable estimate of
expected life in accordance with SAB No. 107, as amended by SAB No. 110. For the expected term, the Company has "plain-vanilla" stock options, and therefore used a simple average of the
vesting period and the contractual term for options granted as permitted by SAB No. 107.   

            Forfeitures    ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures
differ from those estimates. The Company uses its actual forfeiture rate of 3%.   

10. Loss per Share     

Basic and diluted net loss per share is presented in conformity with ASC Topic 260,    Earnings per Share   , ("ASC Topic 260") for all periods
presented. In accordance with ASC Topic 260, basic and diluted net loss per common share was determined by dividing net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted-average common shares
outstanding during the period. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share for the periods indicated:

10. Loss per Share (Continued)    

The
following outstanding securities at September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been excluded from the computation of diluted weighted shares outstanding, as they would have been
anti-dilutive:

Company's common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2016.   

11. Commitments and Contingencies     

License Agreement with Chimerix, Inc.      

On December 17, 2014, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement with Chimerix pursuant to which the Company has licensed
CMX157 from Chimerix for further clinical development and commercialization. CMX157 is a highly potent analog of the antiviral drug tenofovir DF (Viread ). Under the terms of the
agreement, ContraVir licensed CMX157 from Chimerix in exchange for an upfront payment consisting of 120,000 shares of ContraVir Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, Chimerix is
eligible to receive up to approximately $20.0 million in clinical, regulatory and initial commercial milestone payments in the United States and Europe, as well as royalties and additional
milestone payments based on commercial sales in those territories. Either party may terminate the License Agreement upon the occurrence of a material breach by the other party (subject to standard
cure periods), or upon certain events involving the
bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party. The Company may also terminate the License Agreement without cause on a country by country basis upon sixty days' prior written notice to Chimerix.   

          The
fair value of the Preferred B shares exchanged for the license was determined to be equal to the amount paid per share of the Series A, as the provision of the Preferred B
shares were the same as the Preferred A Shares, based on an arm's length transaction. Therefore, the fair value of the Preferred B shares issued was $10.00 per share or $1.2 million. The
cost of the license was classified as a research and development expense in the amount of $1.2 million as the compound is early stage, has not yet reached technological feasibility and has no
alternative use. As of the date of this report, no amounts had been accrued related to the milestone payments Chimerix is eligible to receive.   

License Agreement with University College Cardiff Consultants Limited ("Cardiff")      

On June 10, 2013, the Company and Synergy entered into a Contribution Agreement, as amended and restated on August 5, 2013, or the
Contribution Agreement, to transfer to the Company the FV-100 assets, in exchange for the issuance to Synergy of 9,000,000 shares of the Company's common

representing 100% of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock as of immediately following such issuance. Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, Synergy transferred ownership of all
intellectual property rights acquired from Bristol-Myers Squibb ("BMS") including all historical research, clinical study protocols, data, results and patents related to the FV-100 assets as well as
assumed the obligations of Synergy, including all liabilities of Synergy, under the asset purchase agreement, dated August 17, 2012, by and between Synergy and BMS, or the BMS Agreement.   

          The
FV-100 assets acquired from BMS are licensed from Cardiff pursuant to the terms of that certain Patent and Technology License Agreement, dated as of February 2, 2005, between
Cardiff and CRI, an entity with no prior relationship with us, as amended March 27, 2007, or the Cardiff Agreement.   

The
Cardiff Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until the date upon which the last of the last patent or the last continuation or extension to any patents within the Patent
Rights (as defined in the Cardiff Agreement) expires. Any milestone and/or royalty payment under the Cardiff Agreement shall be payable for as long as the Cardiff Agreement is in effect. The Cardiff
Agreement may be
terminated in its entirety, for among other reasons and in the following manner as set forth below: (a) automatically by Cardiff, if we become bankrupt or insolvent and/or if our business shall
be placed in the hands of a receiver, assignee, or trustee; (b) upon ninety (90) calendar days written notice from Cardiff, if we breach or default (i) on the payment or report
obligations or use of name obligations or (ii) on any other obligation under the Cardiff Agreement, subject to a ninety (90) calendar-day cure period; (c) if we have defaulted or
been in excess of one (1) month late on its payment obligations pursuant to the terms of the Cardiff Agreement on any two (2) occasions in a twelve (12) month period, subject to a
cure period; (d) upon one hundred twenty (120) calendar days written notice from us if any particular patent or patents included in Patent Rights and which account for at least thirty
(30%) percent of the total royalty to Cardiff, is or are irrevocably adjudicated to be invalid; or (e) upon ninety (90) calendar days written notice from us if Cardiff is in breach of
Section 11.1 (Confidential Information and Publication) unless, before the end of the such ninety (90) calendar-day notice period, Cardiff has cured the default or breach to our
reasonable satisfaction and so notifies us, stating the manner of the cure.   

          The
terms of the Cardiff Agreement provided in consideration for a license of all of Cardiff's rights in any technical information, know-how, processes, procedures, compositions,
devices, methods, formulae, protocols, techniques related to the FV-100 Assets, or the Patent Rights. The Cardiff Agreement provided for an initial base payment of $270,000, which has previously been
paid by CRI, subsequent milestone payments covering (i) initiation of a clinical trial at each phase, (ii) marketing (FDA) approval and (iii) on achieving the milestone of
aggregate net sales in three different tiers, as well as a low single digit royalty based on net sales. The total aggregate amount of milestone payments that could be payable to Cardiff by the Company
under the Cardiff Agreement is equal to $400,000 as follows:   

          Milestone

Business Overview     

          We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of antiviral drugs with a primary emphasis on the treatment of Hepatitis B virus
("HBV") infections. We are developing two compounds to treat HBV infection, CMX157 and CRV431. CMX157 is a highly potent oral lipid prodrug of tenofovir. Prodrugs are designed to improve the
characteristics of drugs, such as better efficacy, lower pill burden, improved safety, etc. Another prodrug of tenofovir, Viread , is approved for the treatment of HIV and HBV infections.
CRV431 is a novel drug candidate also designed for the treatment of HBV infection. CRV431 is a novel drug candidate also designed for the treatment of HBV infection. CRV431, a non-immunosuppressive
analog of cyclosporine that we acquired through our merger with Ciclofilin Pharmaceuticals Inc. CRV431 has been designed to target enzymes ("cyclophilins") that play a key role in the HBV viral
life cycle. We are also developing an antiviral asset known as FV-100, FV-100 is an orally available, small molecule compound being developed for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) and
treatment of herpes zoster infection and acute zoster-associated pain. Herpes zoster, otherwise known as shingles, is an infection caused by the reactivation of varicella zoster virus or VZV, the
cause of Chickenpox.   

CMX 157     

          CMX157 is a novel lipid acyclic nucleoside phosphonate that delivers high intracellular concentrations of the active antiviral agent tenofovir
diphosphate. CMX157's novel structure results in decreased circulating levels of tenofovir (TFV), lowering systemic exposure and thereby reducing the potential for renal side effects. We intend to
develop CMX157 for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection and have completed a Phase 1b clinical trial in healthy volunteers, demonstrating a favorable safety,
tolerability and drug distribution profile. We are currently
testing CMX157 in a Phase 2a proof of concept study testing multiple doses of CMX 157 versus Viread .   

  23  

Table of Contents   

          We
licensed CMX157 from Chimerix in exchange for an upfront payment of 120,000 shares of our preferred stock, valued at $1.2 million at the time of the deal. During September
2016, Chimerix elected to convert their Series B Preferred stock into approximately 1.0 million shares of our common stock. We have a composition of matter patent for CMX157 providing
intellectual property protection to at least 2031. The decision to develop CMX157 for Hepatitis B has been taken because we do not see a large opportunity to grow the HIV market with new
compounds, even though CMX157 is 200 times more potent than tenofovir in vitro. We believe the Hepatitis B market is poised for exceptional growth. The strategy for CMX157 is to develop the
compound to serve as the backbone therapy in future HBV combination therapies. We will be seeking to submit an Investigational New Drug application ("IND") to support an initiation of our HBV clinical
development program in the U.S during the first half of 2017.   

CRV431     

          CRV431 is a novel drug candidate designed to target a class of proteins called cyclophilins, of which there are many types. Cyclophilins play a
role in health and in the pathogenesis of certain diseases, and are known as peptidyl prolyl isomerases. The isomerase activity plays an important role in a number of biological processes including,
for example, folding of proteins to confer certain 3-dimensional configurations. And, specific host cyclophilins (e.g., cyclophilin A, B, C, D) play a role in the life cycle of certain
viruses, including for example, HBV, HIV, and hepatitis C virus ("HCV") infections. CRV431 has been developed to inhibit the role of host cyclophilins and therefore interfere in the propagation of
these viruses. CRV431 does not directly target the virus and, as such, should be less susceptible to drug resistance, borne from viral mutations.   

          Thus
far,    in vitro    testing of CRV431 has been conducted in-house and in collaboration with external groups including for example, the
Scripps Research Institute ("Scripps"). Data in various cell lines of either transfected or infected HBV demonstrates nanomolar efficacy (EC50 values) and micromolar toxicity (CC50 values). The
selective index (SI), therefore, is wide and suggests that CRV431 presents a viable clinical drug candidate for the treatment of viral infections, including HBV. Additional testing in a transgenic
mouse model of HBV indicated that CRV431 reduced HBV DNA in the liver. In a non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) mouse model, CRV431 demonstrated anti-fibrotic potential, thus addressing an important
concern of the downstream effects of chronic HBV infection and liver disease. Both animal models confirmed that CRV431 is orally active and appeared to be well tolerated.   

FV-100     

          FV-100 is an orally available, small molecule, nucleoside analogue pro-drug of CF-1743 that we are developing for the treatment of herpes
zoster, which is an infection caused by the reactivation of varicella zoster virus or VZV. VZV is responsible for producing the infectious disease known as chicken pox in individuals upon initial
exposure to the virus. After the initial infection, the virus can remain dormant in nerve endings for many years and if reactivated, causes a painful rash called shingles. FV-100 is being developed
specifically for the treatment of shingles. Nucleoside analogs are capable of disrupting replication of the virus. FV-100 is a pro-drug of CF-1743, which enables us to take advantage of FV-100's more
readily absorbed properties compared to CF-1743 when given orally. FV-100 is then broken down to the active moiety, CF-1743, upon entry into the blood stream. Published preclinical studies demonstrate
that FV-100 is significantly more potent against VZV than currently marketed compounds acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir, the FDA-approved drugs used for the treatment of shingles. We conducted
an extensive review of the clinical data from the completed Phase 2 trial, including performing post-hoc analyses. We performed additional market research (including unmet medical need),
reimbursement, pricing, and competitive landscape analyses, etc. We also evaluated a number of clinical, regulatory and commercial pathways for the potential future development of   

  24  

Table of Contents   

  FV-100.
Based upon the analyses of the completed Phase 2 study coupled with the additional market research, we approached the FDA to discuss our clinical development program and requested an
End of Phase 2 (EoP2) meeting. The meeting was granted and the result was a streamlined development plan for FV-100 that allowed us to proceed directly into a Phase 3 trial without the
need to conduct any additional Phase 2 studies. We had satisfied these criteria and initiated Protocol 007 during the second quarter of 2015.   

          In
parallel to the Phase 3 initiation, Study 008, a drug-drug interaction trial was conducted during January-March, 2015. The study's objective was to highlight potential drug
interactions with compounds which are metabolized using the CYP450 pathway. This is a very common trial in virology and in drug development overall.   

FINANCIAL OPERATIONS OVERVIEW     

          From inception through September 30, 2016, we have sustained an accumulated deficit of approximately $49.4 million. From inception
through September 30, 2016, we have not generated any revenue from operations and expect to incur additional losses to perform further research and development activities and do not currently
have any commercial biopharmaceutical products. We do not expect to have such for several years, if at all.   

          Our
product development efforts are thus in their early stages and we cannot make estimates of the costs or the time they will take to complete. The risk of completion of any program is
high because of the many uncertainties involved in bringing new drugs to market including the long duration of clinical testing, the specific performance of proposed products under stringent clinical
trial protocols, the extended regulatory approval and review cycles, our ability to raise additional capital, the nature and timing of research and development expenses and competing technologies
being developed by organizations with significantly greater resources.   

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES     

          Financial Reporting Release No. 60 requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the
preparation of financial statements. Our accounting policies are described in ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA of our Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Form 10-K") as of
and for year ended June 30, 2016, filed with the SEC on September 28, 2016. There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies since June 30, 2016.   

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS     

          We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2016.   

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS     

          In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers   . This
guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be
entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance also requires an entity to disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount,
timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Qualitative and quantitative information is required about:   

Contracts with customers    including revenue and impairments recognized, disaggregation of
revenue and information about contract balances and performance obligations (including the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations).    
 
  25  

Table of Contents   

Significant judgments and changes in judgments    determining the timing of satisfaction of
performance obligations (over time or at a point in time), and determining the transaction price and amounts allocated to performance obligations.     
             Certain assets    assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract.    

In
August 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance deferring the effective date of the revenue recognition standard. In March, April and May 2016, the FASB issued additional updated
guidance, which clarifies certain aspects of the ASU and the related implementation guidance issued by the FASB-IASB Joint Transition Resource Group for Revenue Recognition. This guidance is effective
for us for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on our results of operations, financial position and
cash flows.   

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     

Comparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015      

We
had no revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015 because we do not have any commercial biopharmaceutical products and we do not expect to have such
products for several years, if at all.   

          Research
and development expenses decreased approximately $0.7 million from $3.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $3.1 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2016, which decrease was comprised primarily of $1.5 million lower costs associated with the development of FV-100 offset by a $0.8 million
increase in development costs associated with the Phase 2a trial of CMX-157.   

          General
and administrative expenses increased approximately $0.7 million from $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $1.8 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2016. Such increase was primarily due to a $0.3 million increase in costs associated with increased employee headcount and consulting fees and
$0.3 million of increased other operating costs associated with being a public company.   

Net
loss decreased approximately $0.03 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2016, such decrease was
a result of the operating expenses discussed above, and a gain resulting from the change in fair value of derivative instruments-warrants of approximately $60,000.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES     

          The following table summarizes our cash flows for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:   

As
of September 30, 2016, we had $3.0 million in cash. Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $4.4 million for the year ended September 30,
2016. As of September 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $1.5 million, as compared to working capital of $1.5 million as of September 30, 2015.   

          On
March 9, 2015, we entered into a Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement (the "Agreement"), with Cantor Fitzgerald   Co., as sales agent ("Cantor"), pursuant
to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, through Cantor shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "Shares"), up to an aggregate offering price of $50.0 million. We
intend to use the net proceeds from these sales to fund our research and development activities, including our Phase 3 clinical trial of FV-100, and for working capital and other general
corporate purposes, and possible acquisitions of other companies, products or technologies, though no such acquisitions are currently contemplated.   

          Under
the Agreement, Cantor may sell the Shares by methods deemed to be an "at-the-market" offering as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Securities Act"), including sales made directly on The NASDAQ Capital Market, on any other existing trading market for the Shares or to or through a market maker. In addition, under the
Agreement, Cantor may sell the Shares by any other method permitted by law, including in privately negotiated transactions.   

          We
are not obligated to make any sales of the Shares under the Agreement. The offering of Shares pursuant to the Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (1) the sale of all
of the Shares subject to the Agreement or (2) the termination of the Agreement by Cantor or us. We will pay Cantor a commission of up to 3.0% of the gross sales price per share sold.   

As
of September 30, 2016, we had not made any sales under the Agreement. During October and November 2016, we sold approximately 3.7 million shares of our common stock
resulting in net proceeds of approximately $8.5 million under the Agreement.   

          In
November 2016, the Company transferred state net operating loss tax credits and received approximately $1.9 million in connection with the sale of the state net operating
losses to a third party. The Company received approval for the sale of net operating losses through participation in the 2016 New Jersey Technology Business Tax Certificate Transfer (NOL) Program.   

Operating and Capital Expenditure Requirements     

          As of September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $49.4 million, and expect to incur significant and increasing operating
losses for the next several years as we expand our research, development and clinical trials of FV-100, CMX157 and CRV431. We are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will
become profitable, if at all.   

  27  

Table of Contents   

          Our
unaudited financial statements as of September 30, 2016 have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. Our independent registered public
accounting firm has issued a report on our audited June 30, 2016 financial statements that included an explanatory paragraph referring to our recurring losses from operations and stockholder's
deficit; and expressing substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern without additional capital becoming available. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our
ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing, attain further operating efficiencies and, ultimately, to generate revenue. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty.   

          We
will be required to raise additional capital within the next year to continue the development and commercialization of current product candidates and to continue to fund operations at
the current cash expenditure levels. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Recently worldwide economic conditions and the international equity
and credit markets have significantly deteriorated and may remain difficult for the foreseeable future. These developments will make it more difficult to obtain additional equity or credit financing,
when needed. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant
dilution. Any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that impact our ability to conduct delay, scale back or discontinue the development and/or commercialization of one or
more product candidates; (ii) seek collaborators for product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable and on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be
available; or (iii) relinquish or otherwise dispose of rights to technologies, product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize its self on unfavorable
terms.    

ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK            

          Not applicable.    

ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES            

Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
September 30, 2016. The term "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a
company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Disclosure controls
and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, as of September 30, 2016, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures are not effective, due to weaknesses in our financial closing process. We intend to implement remedial measures designed to address the ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures.   

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting     

          As required by Rule 13a-15(d) of the Exchange Act, our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial
officer, conducted an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded there were no such changes during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.
