   Notes
to Financial Statements    

   For the
Nine Months Ended April 30, 2016   

Note 1: Organization and Basis
of Presentation   

Paracap Corporation (the  Company )
is a for profit corporation established under laws in the State of Nevada, United States of America on April 1, 2005.  

The Company intends to commence
operations as a beer and wine store retailer and an online retailer of goods and services. The Company is a development stage
company and has not yet realized any revenues from its planned or any other operations. As such, the Company is subject to all
risks inherent to the establishment of a start-up business enterprise.  

The financial statements of the
Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Unless
the context otherwise requires, all references to  Paracap Corporation,   we,   us,   our 
or the  company  are to Paracap Corporation and any subsidiaries.  

The Company s fiscal year
ends July 31.  

Foreign Currency Translation    

The Company is located and operating
outside of the United States of America. It maintains its accounting records in U.S. Dollars, as follows:  

At the transaction date, each
asset, liability, revenue, and expense is translated into U.S. dollars by the use of exchange rates in effect on that date. At
the period end, monetary assets and liabilities are revalued by using the exchange rate in effect at that date. The resulting
foreign exchange gains and losses are included in operations.  

The Company's currency exposure
is insignificant and immaterial and there is no use of derivative instruments to reduce potential exposure to foreign currency
risk.  

Note 2: Significant Accounting
Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

Use of Estimates and Assumptions   

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Due to the limited level of operations,
the Company has not had to make material assumptions or estimates other than the assumption that the Company is a going concern.  

Cash and Cash Equivalents   

The Company considers all highly
liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.  

Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

ASC 825,  Disclosures about
Fair Value of Financial Instruments , requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments. ASC 820,
 Fair Value Measurements  defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted
accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value estimates discussed herein are based
upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of April 30, 2016  

The respective carrying values
of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximate their fair values. These financial instruments include cash, accrued
liabilities and notes payable. Fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values for these financial instruments since they
are short term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair value.  

Basic and Diluted Loss Per
Share   

The Company computes earnings
(loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260-10-45  Earnings per Share , which requires presentation of both basic
and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing
net earnings (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period.
Diluted earnings (loss) per share give effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive
earnings (loss) per share exclude all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company has no potential dilutive
instruments, and therefore, basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share are equal.  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

The Company does not expect the
adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company s results of operations,
financial position or cash flow.  

Note 3: License   

By a management license agreement
dated June 29, 2005, the Company acquired the right and license to manage and operate a liquor retail establishment in the municipality
of Maple Ridge, Canada. The agreement is for five years with an option to renew for an additional five years with the same terms
and conditions except for the consideration, which will be negotiated between the parties, failing which an arbitrator would be
appointed to determine the consideration. The agreement also provides the Company with the right of first refusal to negotiate
terms over the right to manage and operate other of the licensor's establishments in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, Canada.  

The consideration given for the
license was 600,000 common shares of the Company at fair market value of $6,000. In addition, 30% of the monthly net profits (net
operating income), as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, earned by the store
managed by the Company will be remitted to the licensor each month. If there is a net loss, the Company will not be obligated
to pay any percentage.  

The Company has adopted the provisions
of ASC 350,  Amortization of Intangible Assets  and will amortize the license costs over five years on a straight-line
basis.  

Note 4: Commitments and Contingencies   

An officer has provided office
services without charge. Such costs are immaterial to the financial statements and accordingly are not reflected herein. The officer
and director are involved in other business activities and most likely will become involved in other business activities in the
future.  

Note 5: Legal Matters   

The Company has no known legal
issues pending.  

Note 6: Debt   

Loans have been made by an unrelated
third party equal to the operating deficits as they are incurred. A balance of $50,572 is outstanding as of April 30, 2016. The
loans are without interest or a fixed term of repayment. The loans are due on demand.  

Note 7: Related Party Transactions   

During the period ended July
31, 2006 the Company received shareholder loans totaling $5,500. A balance of $5,665 is outstanding as of April 30, 2016, without
interest or a fixed term of repayment. The loans are due on demand.  

Note 8: Capital Stock   

During the period ended July
31, 2005, the Company issued 11,500,000 common shares at $0.001 per share of the Company for total proceeds of $11,500.  

During the period ended July
31. 2005, the Company issued 1,370,000 common shares at $0.01 per share of the Company for total proceeds of $13,700.  

During the period ended July
31. 2005, the Company issued 600,000 common shares at $0.01 per share of the Company for total proceeds of $6,000 in consideration
for a new license acquisition.  

As of April 30, 2016 there were
13,470,000 common shares outstanding.  

Note 9: Income Taxes   

The Company uses the assets and
liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with FASB Topic 740  Income Taxes . Under this method,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between
the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  

The company has not commenced
operations, has not generated any revenue, and has not made a provision for income taxes.  

The Company s statutory
tax rate is 35%.  

The Company does not have any
material uncertainties with respect to its provisions for income taxes.  

Note 10: Going Concern   

The accompanying financial statements
and notes have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.  

For the nine months  period
ended April 30, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $87,437.  

The Company s ability to
continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to generate sufficient revenues to operate profitably
or raise additional capital through debt financing and/or through sales of common stock.  

Management has no formal plan
in place to address these concerns, but believes that the Company will be able to obtain additional funds through equity financing
and/or related party advances.  

The failure to achieve the necessary
levels of profitability or obtain the additional funding would be detrimental to the Company.  

ITEM
2: MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

  This 10-Q contains forward-looking
statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those set forth as a result of general economic conditions and changes
in the assumptions used in making such forward-looking statements. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations should be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and
the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. The analysis set forth below is provided pursuant to applicable
Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and is not intended to serve as a basis for projections of future events. Refer
also to  Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements  and  Risk Factors  below.  

  The following discussion
and analysis provides information which management of Paracap Corporation (the  Company ) believes to be relevant to
an assessment and understanding of the Company's results of operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read
together with the Company's financial statements and the notes to financial statements, which are included in this report.  

   CAUTION ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS   

  This management's discussion
and analysis or plan of operation should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto of the Company
for the quarter ended October 31, 2015. Because of the nature of a relatively new and growing company the reported results will
not necessarily reflect the future.  

  This section includes
a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance.
Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like: believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar
expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking
statements, which apply only as of the date of this prospectus. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks
and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or our predictions.  

   COMPANY OVERVIEW   

  Paracap Corporation was
incorporated in the state of Nevada on April 1, 2005. The Company is planning to begin operations as an online e-commerce website
that promotes daily deals for business-to-business transactions.  

  The Company s technology
is developed in-house and we intend to be a leading provider of advertising and marketing services. A factor that is proprietary
to the Company, is our option to allow users to suggest deals and vote on deals already suggested. This key differentiator is
our user-friendly website which will allow business owners to buy and sell products and services at considerable discounts between
the members of our business to business online community.  

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

  The Company experienced
general and administration expenses of $ 2,523 and $8,840 for the three months ended April 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The
decrease in general and administration expenses for this period are attributed to a decrease in Professional and Regulatory Fees.  

  For the nine months period
ended April 30, 2016, the net loss of the Company is $2,523  

   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   

  During the nine months period
ended April 30, 2016, the Company had no working capital needs. As of April 30, 2016, the Company has cash on hand in the amount
of $0. Management does not expect that the current level of cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next
twelve-month period. In the event that additional funds are required to maintain operations, our officers and directors have agreed
to advance us sufficient capital to allow us to continue operations. We may also be able to obtain loans from our shareholders,
but there are no agreements or understandings in place currently.  

We believe we will require
additional funding to expand our business and ensure its future profitability. We anticipate that any additional funding will
be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. However, we do not have any arrangements in place for any
future equity financing. In the event we are not successful in selling our common stock, we may also seek to obtain short-term
loans from our director.  

   ITEM 3: QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISKS   

  Not applicable  

   ITEM 4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

   Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures   

  We carried out an evaluation,
under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange
Act (defined below)). Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that,
as of the end of the period covered in this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.  

  Our management, including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or
our internal controls will prevent all error or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system
must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included
in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods
presented.  

   Changes in Internal
Control over Financial Reporting   

  In addition, our management
with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have determined that no change in our
internal control over financial reporting occurred during or subsequent to the quarter ended April 30, 2016 that has materially
affected, or is (as that term is defined in Rules 13(a)-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II: OTHER INFORMATION
