NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Hersha Hospitality Trust ( we,   us,   our  or the  Company ) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( US GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the general instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by US GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals), considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three   and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 201  6   or any future period.  Accordingly, readers of these consolidated interim financial statements should refer to the Company s audited financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP, and the related notes thereto, for the year ended December 31, 201  5  , which are included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 201  5  , as certain footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP have been condensed or omitted from this report pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

We are a self-administered Maryland real estate investment trust that was organized in May 1998 and completed our initial public offering in January 1999. Our common shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (the  NYSE ) under the symbol  HT.  We own our hotels and our investments in joint ventures through our operating partnership, Hersha Hospitality Limited Partnership ( HHLP ), for which we serve as the sole general partner.  As   of September 30, 2016,   we owned an   approximate   94.1%   partnership interest in HHLP, including a   1.0%   general partnership interest. 

Noncontrolling Interest 

We classify the noncontrolling interests of our consolidated variable interest entity, common units of limited partnership interest in HHLP ( Common Units ), and Long Term Incentive Plan ( LTIP ) Units as equity. LTIP   Units are a separate   class of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership that are convertible into Common Units under certain circumstances.  The noncontrolling interest of Common Units totaled   $40,160   as of September 30, 2016 and   $31,876   as of December 31, 2015.  As of September 30, 2016, there were   2,613,546   Common Units outstanding with a fair market value of   $47,096  , based on the price per share of our common shares on the NYSE on such date. In accordance with the partnership agreement of HHLP, holders of these   Common Units   may redeem them for cash unless we, in our sole and absolute discretion, elect to issue common shares on a one-for-one basis in lieu of paying cash. 

Net income or loss attributed to Common Units   and LTIP Units  , as well as the net income or loss related to the noncontrolling interests of our consolidated variable interest entity, is included in net income or loss but excluded from net income or loss applicable to common shareholders in the consolidated statements of operations. 

On September 2, 2016, we exercised our option to acquire the non-controlling equity interests in Brisam Management DE, LLC ( Brisam ), the entity which owns the real estate assets of the Holiday Inn Express, New York, NY.  We paid approximately $2,318 to exercise this option.  Prior to the exercise of this option, we had consolidated Brisam, a variable interest entity, in our financial statements as we determined we were the primary beneficiary.  

Variable Interest Entities 

On Januar  y 1, 2016, we adopted ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.  We evaluated the application of ASU No. 2015-02 and concluded that no change was required for the accounting of our interests in less than wholly owned joint ventures. However, HHLP, our operating partnership, now meets the criteria as a variable interest entity.  The Company s most significant asset is its investment in HHLP, and consequently, substantially all of the Company s assets and liabilities represent those assets and liabilities of HHLP.

NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION (CONTINUED) 

Shareholders  Equity 

On May 31, 2016, we completed a public offering of   7,700,000   (including   700,000   overallotment shares sold on June 14, 2016) 6.50% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares. These shares have a par value of $0.01 per share with a $25.00 liquidation preference per share. Net proceeds of the offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and the offering expenses payable   by   us, were   approximately $  185,999  .   We utilized the net proceeds of the offering to redeem all outstanding 8.00% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares on June 8, 2016, and for general corporate purposes. 

Shares of our   8.00% Series B Cumulative Redeemabl  e Preferred Shares   were redeemed at a per share redemption price of   $25.00   together with accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date for an aggregate per share redemption price of   $25.3722  . Dividends ceased accruing on the Series B Preferred Shares on June 8, 2016. 

Terms of the Series B, Series C, and Series D Preferred Shares outstanding at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are summarized as follows: 

In May 2015, our Board of Trustees approved a reverse share split of our issued and outstanding common shares and Common Units and LTIP Units at a ratio of 1-for-4. This reverse share split converted every   four   issued and outstanding common shares into one common share.  The reverse share split was effective as of 5:00 PM Eastern time on June 22, 2015.  As a result of the reverse share split, the number of outstanding common shares was reduced from   191,079,951   to   47,769,961   shares and the number of outstanding Common Units and LTIP Units was reduced from   9,313,063   to   2,328,276   units.   

In October 2015, our Board of Trustees authorized a share repurchase program for up to   $100,000   of common shares which commenced upon the completion of the previous program. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company repurchased   2,605,649   common shares for an aggregate purchase price of   $49,051  . Upon repurchase by the Company, these common shares ceased to be outstanding and became authorized but unissued common shares. 

In October 2016, our Board of Trustees authorized a new share repurchase program for up to   $100,000   of common shares which will commence upon the completion of the existing repurchase program. The new repurchase program will expire on December 31, 2017, unless extended by our Board of Trustees. 

New Accounting Pronouncements 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Award Payment Accounting  , which simplifies various aspects of how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. This standard requires companies to record all of the tax effects related to share-based payments through the income statement, allows companies to elect an accounting policy to either estimate the share based award forfeitures (and expense) or account for forfeitures (and expense) as they occur, and allows companies to withhold a percentage of the shares issuable upon settlement of an award up to the maximum individual statutory tax rate without causing the award to be classified as a liability. The new standard is effective for the Company on January 1, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2016-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION (CONTINUED) 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842),   which requires lessees to record operating and financing leases as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and lessors to expense costs that are not initial direct leasing costs. This standard will be effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

We adopted ASU No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, on January 1, 2016.  This standard requires debt issuance costs to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability.  Previously, debt issuance costs were recorded as an asset.  The issuance costs will continue to be amortized over the life of the debt instrument and recorded in interest expense, as they were prior to the new standard.  As part of this adoption, debt issuance costs are now included as an offset to the mortgages, unsecured term loans and unsecured notes payable line items on the consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented. For full reclassification amounts, see  Note 5   Debt . 

On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.  The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective.  The new standard is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018.  Early adoption is permitted, but not prior to the original effective date of January 1, 2017.  The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.  The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  The Company continues to evaluate this standard and the impact it will have, if any, on our ongoing financial reporting. 

Reclassification 

Certain amounts in the prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

NOTE 2   INVESTMENT IN HOTEL PROPERTIES   (CONTINUED) 

Included in the consolidated statement of operations for the three and   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016   are total revenues of   $11,450   and   $20,147  , and total net income of   $2,712   and   $5,259   for the hotels   we acquired during the nine months ended S  eptember 30, 2016   and consolidated since the date of acquisition of the hotels. 

Purchase and Sale Agreement 

In July 2016, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to purchase the Courtyard Sunnyvale, CA from an unaffiliated seller for a purchase price of   $75,000  . Included in this purchase price is the assumption of   $40,600   of mortgage debt. The transaction closed on October 20, 2016. Accounting for this acquisition requires an allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in the transaction at their respective estimated fair values.   

Hotel Dispositions 

On September 7, 2016, the Company closed on the sale   of Hawthorn Suites, Franklin, M  A to an unaffiliated buyer for a total sales price of   $8,900   with a loss on sale of approximately   $437  . This hotel was acquired by the Company in April 2006. The operating results for this   hotel are included in operating income   as shown in the consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 as disposition of this hotel does not represent a strategic shift in our business. 

On May 3, 2016, the Company closed on the sale of Hyatt Place, King of Prussia, PA to an unaffiliated buyer for a total sales price of   $13,000   with a gain on sale of approximately   $5,402  . This hotel was acquired by the Company in August 2010. The operating results for this hotel are included in operating income as shown in the consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 as disposition of this hotel does not represent a   strategic shift in our business. 

On February 4, 2016, we announced the signing of asset purchase and contribution agreements (the  Contribution Agreements ) with Cindat Manhattan Hotel Portfolio (US) LLC ( Cindat ) to form a joint venture, Cindat Hersha Owner JV, LLC (the  Owner JV ), which initially invests in   seven   of our limited service hotels in Manhattan (The  JV Properties ). This transaction was consummated on April 29, 2016.  The Contribution Agreements valued the JV Properties at   $543,500  .  Cindat contributed   $354,550   and received a   70%   senior common equity interest in Owner JV.  We contributed the JV Properties to Owner JV and received   $354,550   in cash and a preferred equity interest initially valued at   $37,000  . In addition, we retained a   30%   junior common equity interest in Owner JV. We contributed   $12,239   and Cindat contributed an aggregate of   $14,105   in working capital and closing costs for the formation of Owner JV, and finance costs related to debt originated on the JV Properties by Owner JV. In addition, we incurred additional closing costs associated with the contribution of the JV Properties to Owner JV of   $10,653  .

NOTE 2   INVESTMENT IN HOTEL PROPERTIES   (CONTINUED) 

Prior to the contribution to Owner JV, our basis in the JV Properties was   $264,658  .  Our preferred equity and junior common equity interest in Owner JV was initially recorded at   $104,248   which represents our retained interest in the JV Properties at our basis prior to contribution and additional contributions made for the formation of Owner JV. Please refer to  Note 3   Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures  more information about the joint venture with Cindat. 

Due to our continuing interest in the JV Properties, gain recognized on the properties is limited to cash received less the basis of the properties contributed. As a result, we recognized a gain on the disposition of hotel properties of   $89,892   and recorded a deferred gain of   $81,  334  ,   which is recorded as a liability in the consolidated balance sheets.  The deferred gain will be recognized as income in a future period if an event occurs that changes our retained interest in the JV Properties.  

Proceeds received from the contribution of the JV Properties were used to reduce our consolidated mortgage debt by   $55,103  , our line of credit balance by   $194,550   and our unsecured term loan balance by   $39,480  . Any remaining proceeds are to be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the acquisition of hotel properties, the repurchase of our common shares and future distributions to shareholders.

NOTE 3   INVESTMENT   IN UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES 

As of September 30, 2016   and December 31, 201  5,   our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures consisted of the following: 

*See explanation below of the Cindat Hersha Owner JV, LLC ( Owner JV ) for more information on the preferred return provisions of this joint venture. 

On April 29, 2016, we entered into   two   limited liability company agreements with Cindat, which formed Owner JV and Cindat Hersha Lessee JV, LLC ( Lessee JV ), for the purpose of owning and operating hotel properties initially consisting of the JV Properties.  All hotel properties owned by Owner JV are leased to Lessee JV. Our interest in Owner JV is held by our operating partnership, HHLP, while our interest in Lessee JV is held by our wholly owned taxable REIT subsidiary ( TRS ), 44 New England Management Company ( 44 New England ). 

As described in  Note 2   Investment in Hotel Properties  the Contribution Agreements valued the JV Properties at $543,500.  In accordance with the Contribution Agreements, Cindat contributed $354,550 in cash, in exchange for a 70.0% senior common equity interest in Owner JV. We contributed the JV Properties to Owner JV and received $354,550 in cash, a preferred equity interest initially valued at $37,000, and a 30.0% junior common equity interest in Owner JV. In addition, Cindat contributed $14,105 and we contributed $12,239 for working capital and closing costs for the formation of Owner JV and for finance costs related to debt originated on the JV Properties by Owner JV. Of the $12,239 in additional funds contributed by us,   $6,045   was attributed to our junior common equity interest and   $6,194   was attributed to our preferred equity interest.  We also incurred   $361   of costs related to our contribution which is included in our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures as outside basis and will be amortized over the life of the venture. 

Prior to the contribution to Owner JV, our basis in the JV Properties was $264,658.  Our preferred equity and junior common equity interest in Owner JV was initially recorded at $104,248 which represents our retained interest in the JV Properties at our basis prior to contribution and additional contributions made for the formation of Owner JV. The difference between our interest in the fair value of the assets contributed to Owner JV and our basis prior to contribution is   $96,941  , which will be amortized over the life of the underlying assets. 

At closing, mortgage debt of   $285,000   and mezzanine debt of   $50,000   (collectively, the  Cindat JV Financings)  was placed on the JV Properties.  Owner JV distributed proceeds of   $323,793   from the debt originated, of which   $226,655   was distributed to Cindat and   $97,138   was distributed to us, reducing our investment in Owner JV accordingly. 

Subject to the terms of the Cindat JV Financings, cash available for distribution will be distributed (1) to us until we receive a   9%   annual rate of return on our   $43,194   preferred equity interest, (2) then to Cindat until they receive a   10%   return on their remaining   $142,000   senior common equity interest and (3) then to us until we receive an   8%   return on our   $60,857   junior common equity interest.  Any cash available for distribution remaining will be split 30% to us and 70% to Cindat.  Cindat s senior common equity return is reduced by   0.5%   annually for   4   years following the closing until it is set at a rate of   8%   for the remainder of the life of the joint venture. Pursuant to the terms of agreements governing the Cindat JV Financings, a lender determined that certain debt coverage ratio covenants contained therein were not met as of June 30, 2016. Pursuant to these agreements, the lender has elected to escrow the operating cash flow for the Owner JV. However, the failure to meet these covenants does not constitute an event of default under the Cindat JV Financings.

NOTE 3   INVESTMENT   IN UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES (CONTINUED) 

The Owner JV is under an Asset Management Agreement with us and Cindat whereby it is provided asset management services.  Fees for these services are calculated as   1.0%   of operating revenues, of which we are entitled to 30% which we recognize as income in other revenues on the consolidated statement of operations. 

For SB Partners, LLC and Hiren Boston, LLC, income or loss   is allocated to us and our joint venture partners consistent with the allocation of cash distributions in accordance with the joint venture agreements.   This results in an income allocation consistent with our percentage of ownership interests. 

For Mystic Partners, LLC and Owner JV, LLC, incom  e or loss is allocated using   Hypothetical Liquidation at Book Value ( HLBV   method   ) as the liquidation rights and priorities  ,   as defined by   each   venture     s   governing   agreements  ,   differ from the underlying percentage ownership interests   in the ventures.    The Company applies the HLBV method using a balance sheet approach.  A calculation is prepared at each balance sheet date to determine the amount that we would receive if   the   venture entity were   to liquidate all of its assets at   carrying value and distribute that cash to the joint venture partners based on the contractually defined liquidation priorities.  The difference between the calculated liquidation distribution amounts at the beginning and the end of the reporting period, after adjusting for capital contributions and distributions, is our share of the earnings or losses from the unconsolidated joint venture investment for the period. 

Any difference between the carrying amount of   any of our   investments   noted above   and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized over the expected useful lives of the properties and other intangible assets.   Income   recognized   during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 201  5  , for our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is as follows: 

The following tables set forth the total assets, liabilities, equity and components of net income or loss, including the Company s share, related to the unconsolidated joint ventures disc  ussed above as of September 30, 2016   and December 31  , 2015 and for the three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 201  5  .

NOTE 4   OTHER ASSETS 

Other Assets 

Other Assets co  nsisted of the following at September 30, 2016   and December 31, 201  5  : 

Investment in Statutory Trusts   - We have an investment in the common stock of Hersha Statutory Trust I and Hersha Statutory Trust II. Our investment is accounted for under the equity method. 

Prepaid Expenses -   Prepaid expenses include amounts paid for property tax, insurance and other expenditures that will be expensed in the next twelve months. 

Deferred Tax Asset   - We have   approximately   $19,103   of net deferred tax assets as of   September 30, 2016  . We have considered various factors, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies in determining a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets, and we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the   $19,103   of net   deferred tax assets in the future. 

Deposits on Hotel Acquisitions 

As of December 31, 2015, we had     $5,000     in interest bearing deposits related to the future acquisition of the     Sanctuary Beach Resort, located in     Marina, California.

As of September 30, 2016, we had     $4,000   in non-interest bearing deposits related to the expected acquisition of the Courtyard by Marriott, located in Sunnyvale, California, which closed on October 20, 2016.

NOTE 5     DEBT 

Mortgages 

Mortgages payable at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consisted of the following: 

Net Unamortized Deferred Financing Costs associated with entering into mortgage indebtedness are deferred and amortized over the life of the mortgages.  Net Unamortized Premiums are al  so amortized over the remaining life of the loans. 

Mortgage indebtedness balances are subject to   fixed and variable interest rates, which ranged from   2.78%   to   6.30%   as of     September 30, 2016  . Aggregate   interest expense incurred under the mortgage loans payable totaled   $4,930     and   $6,404   and   $16,921   and   $20,372     during the three   and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 201  5  , respectively. 

Our mortgage indebtedness contains various financial and non-financial covenants customarily found in secured, non-recourse financing arrangements. Our mortgage loans   payable typically require that specified debt service coverage ratios be maintained with respect to the financed properties before we can exercise certain rights under the loan agreements relating to such properties. If the specified criteria are not satisfied, the lender may be able to escrow cash flow generated by the property securing the applicable mortgage loan.   We have determined that certain debt service coverage ratio covenants contained in the loan agreements securing our hotel properties were met as of September 30, 2016. Pursuant to these loan agreements, if the debt service coverage ratio covenants were not me  t  , the lender could elect to escrow the operating cash flow for these properties. However, these covenants do not constitute an event of default for these loan agreements. 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the maturity dates for the outstanding mortgage loans ranged   from   January 201  7   to     February 2024. 

Subordinated Notes Payable 

We have   two   junior subordinated notes payable in the aggregate amount of   $51,548   to the Hersha Statutory Trusts pursuant to indenture agreements which will mature on   July 30, 2035  , but may be redeemed at our option, in whole or in part, prior to maturity in accordance with the provisions of the indenture agreements.  The   $25,774   of notes issued to   each of   Hersha Statutory Trust I   and Hersha Statutory Trust II   bear interest at a variable rate of   LIBOR   plus   3%   per annum.  This rate resets   two   business days   prior to each quarterly payment.    The face value of the notes payable is   offset by   $983   and   $1,023   as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, in net deferred financing costs incurred as a result of entering into these indentures. The deferred financing costs are amortized over the life of the notes payable.   The weighted average interest rate on our two junior subordinated notes   payable was   3.80%   and   3.36%   and   3.69%   and   3.31%     during the three and   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Interest expense in the amount of   $  490   and   $434   and   $1,427   and   $1,278     was recorded   for the three   and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 201  5  , respectively. 

Credit Facilities 

We maintain a senior unsecured credit agreement with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and various other lenders. The credit agreement provides for a   $500,000   senior unsecured credit facility ( Credit Facility ) consisting of a     $250,000     senior unsecured revolving line of credit ( Line of Credit ), and a     $250,000     senior unsecured term loan ( First Term Loan ). The     Credit Facility expires on     February 28, 2018  , and, provided no event of default has occurred, we may request that the lenders     renew the credit facility for an additional     one  -year period. The Credit Facility is also expandable to     $850,000     at our request, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.

We maintain an   interest rate swap  , with a   $150,000   notional amount,   which effectively fix  es   the interest rate on   $150,000 of   th  e First Term Loan   at a blended rate of   2.914%  . See  Note 7   Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments  for more information.    

The balance of the Term Loans is offset by   $3,246   and   $2,  220   in net deferred financing costs as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These costs were incurred as a result of originating the term loan borrowings and are amortized over the life of these loans.

Capitalized Interest 

We utilize cash, mortgage debt and our Line of Credit to finance on-going capital improvement projects at our hotels. Interest incurred on mortgages and the Line of Credit that relates to our capital improvement projects is capitalized through the date when the assets are placed in service.

Deferred Financing Costs 

As noted above, costs associated with entering into mortgages, notes payable and our credit facilities are deferred and amortized over the life of the debt instruments. The deferred costs related to mortgages and term loans and unsecured notes payable are presented as reductions in the respective debt balances. Amortization of deferred costs for the three and   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015 was   $  645   and   $619   and   $1,945   and   $1,996  , respectively  .

NOTE   5     DEBT (CONTINUED) 

On June 10, 2015, we repaid in full outstanding mortgage debt with an original principal balance of     $55,000     secured by the Hyatt Union Square, NY and simultaneously entered into a new mortgage obligation of   $55,750  , incurring a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately   $212  .

NOTE   6     COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

Management Agreements 

Our wholly-owned TRS, 44 New England,   and certain of our joint venture entities   engage eligible independent contractors in accordance with the requirements for qua  lification as a REIT under the I  nternal   R  evenue   C  ode of 1986, as amended, including   Hersha Hospitality Management Limited Partnership (   HHMLP   )  , as the property managers for hotels it leases from us pursuant to management agreements. HHMLP is owned, in part, by certain executives and trustees of the Company. Our management agreements with HHMLP provide for   five  -year terms and are subject to early termination upon the occurrence of defaults and certain other events described therein. As required under the REIT qualification rules, HHMLP must qualify as an  eligible independent contractor  during the term of the management agreements. Under the management agreements, HHMLP generally pays the operating expenses of our hotels. All operating expenses or other   expenses incurred by HHMLP in performing its authorized duties are reimbursed or borne by our TRS to the extent the operating expenses or other expenses are incurred within the limits of the applicable approved hotel operating budget. HHMLP is not obligated to advance any of its own funds for operating expenses of a hotel or to incur any liability in connection with operating a hotel.   Our m  anagement agreements with other unaffiliated hotel management companies have   terms that are consistent with those typically used by other hotel management companies  . 

For its services, HHMLP receives a base management fee and, if a   hotel exceeds certain thresholds, an incentive management fee. The base management fee for a hotel is due monthly and is equal to     3%   of gross revenues associated with each hotel managed for the related month. The incentive management fee, if any, for a hotel is due annually in arrears on the ninetieth day following the end of each fiscal year and is based upon the financial performance of the hotels. For the three and   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016   and 2015, base management fees incurred totaled   $3,  385  , and   $3,710   and   $9,994   and   $10,086  , respectively, and are recorded as Hotel Operating Expenses. For the three and   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016   and 2015, we did not incur incentive management fees. 

Franchise Agreements 

Our branded hotel properties are operated under franchise agreements assumed by the hotel property lessee. The franchise agreements have   10   to   20   year terms, but may be terminated by either the franchisee or franchisor on certain anniversary dates specified in the agreements. The franchise agreements require payments for franchise royalties, reservation, and advertising services, and such payments are based upon percentages of gross room revenue. These payments are paid by the hotels and   charged to expense as incurred. Franchise fee expenses for the three   and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 201  5   were   $6,252     and   $7,528   and   $18,899     and   $  20,760  , respectively  , and are recorded in Hotel Operating Expenses. The initial fees incurred to enter into the franchise agreements are amortized over the life of the franchise agreements. 

Accounting and Information Technology Fees 

Each of the wholly-owned hotels and consolidated joint venture hotel properties managed by HHMLP incurs a monthly accounting and information technology fee. Monthly fees for accounting services are between   $2   and   $3   per property and monthly information technology fees range from   $1   to   $2   per property. For the three and   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016   and 2015, the Company incurred accounting fees of   $  341   and   $379   and     $1,088   and   $1,100  ,    respectively. For the three and   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016   and 2015, the Company incurred information technology fees of   $  115   and   $114   and   $346   and   $326  , respectively. Accounting fees and information technology fees are included in Hotel Operating Expenses. 

Capital Expenditure Fees 

HHMLP charges a   5%   fee on all capital expenditures and pending renovation projects at the properties as compensation for procurement services related to capital expenditures and for project management of renovation projects. For the three and   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016   and 2015, we incurred fees of   $  307   and   $224   and   $1,036   and   $607  ,    respectively  , which were capitalized with the cost of fixed asset additions.

NOTE 7   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS 

Fair Value Measurements 

Our determination of fair value measurements are based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, we utilize a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy). 

Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liabilities, which are typically based on an entity s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s derivative instruments represented the only financial instruments measured at fair value. Currently, the Company uses derivative instruments, such as interest rate swaps     and caps,     to manage its interest rate     risk. The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs. 

We incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees. 

Although we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and the counterparties. However, as of   September 30, 2016   we have assessed the significance of the effect of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our derivative positions and have determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives. As a result, we have determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

NOTE 7   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED) 

Derivative Instruments 

On June 10, 2015, we refinanced the debt associated with Hyatt Union Square. As a result, we entered into an interest rate cap 

with a strike rate of 3.000%. The original interest rate cap matured on April 9, 2016 and was replaced by the aforementioned interest rate cap with a strike rate of 3.000%.  

On October 7, 2016, we entered into an interest rate swap associated with $150,000 of our $200,000 Third Term Loan. This swap effectively fixes the interest rate of the Third Term Loan at 3.211%. This swap matures on October 3, 2019. 

The fair value of certain swaps and our interest rate caps is included in other assets at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 201  5   and the fair value of certain of our interest rate swaps is included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 201  5  . 

The net change in fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges was a gain of   $153   and a loss of   $69   for the three months ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and a loss of   $68   and   $690   for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These unrealized gains/losses were reflected on our consolidated balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss. 

Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s variable-rate derivative. The change in net unrealized gains/losses on cash flow hedges reflects a reclassification of   $110   and   $575  , and   $428   and   $1,286   of net unrealized gains/losses   from accumulated other comprehensive income as an increase  /decrease   to interest expense for the three   and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   For the next twelve months ending   September 30, 2017  ,    we   estimate     that an   additional   $152   will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense. 

Fair Value of Debt 

We   estimate the fair value of   our   fixed rate debt and the credit spreads over variable market rates on   our   variable rate debt by discounting the future cash flows of each instrument at estimated market rates or credit spreads consistent with the maturity of the debt obligation with similar credit policies. Credit spreads take into consideration general market conditions and maturity. The inputs utilized in estimating the fair value of debt are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the carrying value and estimated fair value of   our   debt were   $1,062,200   and   $1,062,354  ,   respectively.  As of December 31, 201  5  , the carrying value and estimated fair   value of our debt were     $1,169,964   and   $1,170,901  , respectively.

NOTE 8   SHARE BASED PAYMENTS 

In May 2011, the Company established and our shareholders approved the Hersha Hospitality Trust 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2012 Plan ) for the purpose of attracting and retaining executive officers, employees, trustees and other persons and entities that provide services to the Company. 

Executives   Employees 

Annual Long Term Equity Incentive Programs 

To further align the interests of the Company s executives with those of shareholders, the Compensation Committee grants annual long term equity incentive awards that are both  performance based  and  time based.     

On March 17  , 201  6  , the Compensation Committee approved the 201  6   Annual Long Term Equity Incentive Program ( 201  6   Annual EIP )   for the executive officers, pursuant to which the executive officers are eligible to earn equity awards in the form of stock awards  , LTIP Unit  s,   or performance share awards issuable pursuant to the 2012 Plan.    These awards   are earned under the 2016   Annual EIP based on achieving a threshold, target or maximum level of performance in the performance of RevPAR growth in certain defined areas.  The Company accounts for these grants as performance awards for which the Company assesses the   probability of   achievement of the performance conditions at the end of each period. As of   September 30, 2016  ,    no   shares or LTIP Units have been issued in accordance with the 2012 Plan to the executive officers in settlement of 201  6   Annual EIP awards. 

The following table is a summary of all unvested LTIP Units issued to executives: 

(1) 

25% of the issued shares or LTIP Units vested immediately upon issuance.  In general, the remaining shares or LTIP Units vest 25% on the first through third anniversaries of the end of the performance period (subject to continuous employment through the applicable vesting date).     

(2) 

On April 18, 2012, the Company entered into amended and restated employment agreements with the Company s executive officers.  To induce the executives to agree to the substantial reduction in benefits upon certain terminations following a change of control as described in the agreements, the Company awarded an aggregate of 258,899 restricted common shares to the executives pursuant to the 2012 Plan, which were subsequently forfeited and replaced with LTIP Units.    One-third   of each award of LTIP Units vested or will vest on each of the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the   original   date of issuance.  Vesting will accelerate upon a change of control or if the relevant executive s employment with the Company were to terminate for any reason other than for cause (as defined in the employment agreements).     

(3) 

On December 23, 2014, the 2012 Plan was amended and restated to add LTIP Units as a type of award available under the 2012 Plan. On this date, the Compensation Committee approved an aggregate of   487,081   LTIP Units to certain executive officers.  These executive officers forfeited an aggregate of 487,081 Class A Common Shares, all of which were unvested as of the grant date of the LTIP Units and previously awarded to the executive officers under the 2012 Plan as restricted stock awards. These LTIP Units are subject to the same time-based vesting conditions that applied to the forfeited restricted stock awards.

Stock based compensation expense related to the Annual Long Term Equity Incentive Program  s   of   $  952     a  nd   $  1,001   and   $  3,314     and   $3,132     was incurred during the three   and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 201  5  , respectively.  Unea  rned compensation related to the Annual Long Term Equity Incentive Program  s   as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 201  5   was   $  2,292     a  nd   $  2,484  , respectively. 

Unearned c  ompensation related to the   grants and amortization of   LTIP Units is included in Noncontrolling Interests on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Equity. 

Multi-Year Long Term Equity Incentive Programs 

On March 17, 2016, the Compensation Committee approved the 2016 Multi-Year Long Term Equity Incentive Program ( 2016 Multi-Year EIP ). This program has a three-year performance period which commenced on January 1, 2016 and ends December 31, 2018. As of September 30, 2016, no shares or LTIP Units have been issued to the executive officers in settlement of 2016 Multi-Year EIP awards.   

The followin  g table is a summary of the approved Multi-Year Long Term Equity Incentive Programs  : 

The shares or LTIP Units issuable under the Multi-Year Long Term Incentive Programs, including the 2016 Multi-Year EIP,   are based on the Company s achievement of a certain level of (1) absolute total shareholder return (  37.50%   of the award), (2) relative total shareholder return as compared to the Company s peer group (  37.50%   of the award), and (3) relative growth in revenue per available room   (RevPar)   compared to the Company s peer group (  25%   of the award). 

The Company accounts for the total shareholder return components of these grants as market based awards where the Company estimates unearned compensation at the grant date fair value which is then amortized into compensation cost over the vesting period of each individual plan.  The Company accounts for the RevPAR component of the grants as performance-based awards for which the Company assesses the probable achievement of the performance conditions at the end of the reporting period. 

Stock based compensation expe  nse of   $  343     and   $  217   and   $1,  527   and   $  601     was recorded for the three   and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 201  5  , respectively, for the Multi-Year Long Term Equity Incentive Programs.  Unearned compensation related to the multi-year program as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 201  5  , respectively, was   $  1,911     and   $  1,548  .

*      Income (loss) allocated to noncontrolling interest in HHLP has been excluded from the numerator and Common Units and Vested LTIP Units have been omitted from the denominator for the purpose of computing diluted earnings per share since including these amounts in the numerator and denominator would have no impact.  In addition, potentially dilutive common shares, if any, have been excluded from the denominator if they are   anti-dilutive to income (loss)   applicable to common shareholders.

BACKGROUND 

As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned interests in 55   hotels in major urban gateway markets including New York, Washington DC, Boston, Philadelphia, San Diego, Los Angeles and Miami, including   43   wholly-owned hotels and interests in   12   hotels owned through unconsolidated joint ventures.      We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 1999. For purposes of the REIT qualification rules, we cannot directly operate any of our hotels. Instead, we must lease our hotels to a third party lessee or to a TRS, provided that the TRS engages an eligible independent co  ntractor to manage the hotels.   As of   September 30, 2016  , we have leased all of our hotels to a wholly-owned TRS, a joint venture owned TRS, or an entity owned by our wholly-owned TRS. Each of these TRS entities will pay qualifying rent, and the TRS entities have entered into management contracts with qualified independent managers, including HHMLP, with respect to our hotels. We intend to lease all newly acquired hotels to a TRS. The TRS structure enables us to participate more directly in the operating performance of our hotels. The TRS directly receives all revenue from, and funds all expenses relating to, hotel operations. The TRS is also subject to income tax on its earnings. 

OVERVIEW 

We believe the   changes   in our equity and debt capitalization and repositioning of our portfolio better enables us to capitalize on further improvement in lodging fundamentals. During 201  6   thus far, we continued to see improvements in ADR, RevPAR and operating margins, led by hotels in most of our major locations. We continue to seek acquisition opportunities in urban centers and central business districts. In addition, we will continue to look for att  ractive opportunities to divest certain   of   our   properties at favorable prices, potentially redeploying that capital in our focus markets   or opportunistically repurchasing our common shares  .    W  e may seek to buy out, or sell our joint venture interests to select existing joint venture partners.  

W  e expect continued   stability   and improvement in consumer and commercial spending and lodging demand   in many of our markets   during   2016.  However   some   markets, such as New York City and South Florida,   are   encounter  ing   less favorable supply and demand dynamics. Industry wide occupancy has surpassed peak occupancy from the previous cycle which should allow hotel operators to increase ADR across the United States ( U.S. ).  International visitation to the U.S. is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4.0% through 2019, according to the National Travel and Tourism Office. However  , the manner in which the economy will continue to grow, if at all, is not predictable. In addition, the availability of hotel-level financing for the acquisition of new hotels is not within our control. As a result, there can be no assurances that we will be able to grow hotel revenues, occupancy, ADR or RevPAR at our properties as we hope.   Factors that might contribute to less-than-anticipated performance include those described under the heading  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 201  5   and other documents that we may file with the SEC in the future.  We will continue to cautiously monitor lodging demand and rates, our third-party hotel managers, and our performance generally.

SUMMARY OF OPERATING RESULTS 

The following table outlines operating results for the Company s portfolio of wholly owned hotels and those owned through joint venture interests that are consolidated in our financial statements for the three   and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 201  5  . 

RevPAR for the three   and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     increased 2.5% and 1.6% respectively   for our consolidated hotels when compared to the same period in 201  5  .    The     overall   increase represents a continued growth trend in RevPAR, which is primarily due to the improving economic conditions   in certain markets   since   September 30, 2015   and the acquisition of hotel properties consummated in 201  5     and 2016 that are accretive to RevPAR.   Results were hindered by ongoing renovations at five of our hotels and new supply which inhibited rate growth in some of our properties in New York City and the South Florida markets.  As mentioned previously, we contributed seven consolidated hotel properties located in New York City to Owner JV on April 29, 2016. Consolidated results subsequent to this date do not include the operations of these seven properties.  

The following table outlines operating results for hotels we own through an unconsolidated joint venture interest  s  . These operating results reflect 100% of the operating results of the property including our interest and the interests of our joint venture partners and other noncontrolling interest holders.    

The increases in occupancy, ADR, RevPAR, room revenues and total revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 over the same periods in 2015 are primarily driven by the contribution of seven consolidated hotel properties located in New York City to Owner JV on April 29, 2016. The addition of these seven hotels, located in a market that typically has higher occupancy and ADR than the markets of our existing unconsolidated joint venture hotel properties, contribute  d $21,3  52 and $36,576 in total revenue to our unconsolidated joint venture hotel portfolio during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The remainder of our   unconsolidated joint venture portfolio s results were hindered by renovation disruption at one of our hotel properties located in Hartford, CT.

We define a same store consolidated hotel as one that is currently consolidated, that we have owned in whole or in part for the entirety of the periods being presented, and is deemed fully operational.  Based on this definition, for the three   and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 201  5   there   are 38 same   store hotels  .  The following table outlines operating results for the three   and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 201  5  , for our same store consolidated hotels: 

RevPAR for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased 2.9% and 1.9% respectively for our same store consolidated hotels when compared to the same period in 2015.   Same store consolidated hotels excludes the results from the seven New York City hotels contributed to Owner JV from both years presented.   Results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015 were hindered by ongoing renovations at five of our hotels and new supply which inhibited rate growth in some of our properties in New York City and the South Florida markets.

Revenue 

Our total revenues for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   consisted of hotel operating revenues and other revenue.  Hotel operating   revenues were approximately 99.9  % of total revenues for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 201  5  .  Hotel operating revenues are recorded for who  lly-  owned hotels that are leased to our wholly owned TRS and hotels owned through joint venture   or other   interests that are consolidated in our financial statemen  ts.  Hotel operating revenues de  creased $  3,973  , or   3.2  %, to $  120,515   for the   three   months ended   September     30, 2016   compared to $  124,488   for the same period in   2015.  This decrease in hotel operating revenues was primarily attributable to the impact of the hotels contributed to the Cindat joint venture  , offset by the acquisition of hotel properties, continued growth and stabilization of our existing assets  .   Acquisitions contributed $16,421 in incremental revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, while the contribution of seven hotels to our joint venture with Cindat caused a decrease in revenue by $22,660 during the same period. 

From     September     30, 2015 through September 30, 2016  , w  e have acquired interests in four   consolidated hotel  s. These     h  otel  s acquired prior to September     30, 2016   contributed the following operating revenues for the   three   months ended   September     30, 2016  . 

Revenues for all hotels were recorded from the date of acquisition as hotel operating revenues. Further, hotel operating revenues for the three months ended   September     30, 2016 included revenues for a full three months related to the one hotel that was purchased during the three months ended   September     30, 2015. We acquired interests in the following hotel during the three months ended   September     30, 2015:

Table of Contents  

Offsetting these acquisitions is our contribution of the seven properties to the joint venture with Cindat during the second quarter of 2016. These seven hotels did not contribute any operating revenues to our consolidated hotel portfolio for the three months ended   September     30, 2016 compared to the three months ended   September     30, 2015 when we recorded $22,660. 

Expenses 

Total hotel operating expenses increased   0.6  % to approximately $  66,779   for the   three   months ended   September     30, 2016   from $  66,373   for the   three   months ended   September     30, 2015  .    This increase in operating expenses is primarily attributable to hotel properties acquired in our existing portfolio,   offset by   a decrease in hotel operating expenses which were not recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2016   due to the contribution of   seven hotel properties to the joint venture with Cindat. D  epreciation and amortization   decreased by     0.6  %, or $  110,   to $  18,704   for the   three   months ended   September     30, 2016   from $  18  ,814   fo  r the three months ended September     30, 2015. The decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily attributable to the   contribution of   the seven hotel properties contributed to the joint venture with Cindat  , offset by depreciation and amortization recorded on the hotels recently acquired  . Real   estate and personal property tax and   property insurance de  creased $  1,792,   or   19.7  %, for the   three   months ended   September     30, 2016   when compared to the same period in 201  5  .    This was primarily attributable   to $2,  324 in real estate and property insurance recognized for the seven hotel properties contributed to the joint venture with Cindat for the three months ended September 30, 2015 which was not recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2016. We otherwise typically experience increases in tax assessments and tax rates as the economy improves which are offset by reductions resulting from our management of this expense.  

Gener  al and administrative expense increased     by 12.6%, or   approximately $  604,     from $  4,796   in the   three   months ended   September     30, 2015   to $  5  ,400   for the same period in 201  6  .  General and administrative expense includes expense related to non-cash share based payments issued as incentive compensation to the Company s trustees, executives, and employees.  Expense  s   related to share based compensation   increased $103   when comparing the three   months ended   September     30, 2016   to the same period in 201  5  .    Please refer to  Note 8   Share Based Payments  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for   more information about our share   based compensation. 

Amounts recorded on our consolidated statement of operations for acquisition and terminated transaction costs will fluctuate from period to period based on our acquisition activities.  Acquisition and terminated transaction costs typically consist of transfer taxes, legal fees and other costs associated with acquiring a hotel property and transactions that were terminated during the year. Acquisition and   terminated transaction costs in  creased   $  24     from   $  146   for the   three   months ended   September     30, 2015   to   $  170   for the same period in 201  6. 

Operating Income 

Operating income for the three months ended   September     30, 2016 was $2  1  ,  356   compared to operating income of $  24  ,  519   during the same period in 2015. O  perating income was   negatively   impacted by the   dispositions of the hotel properties noted above.

Interest Expense 

Interest expense de  creased $  642   from $1  1  ,  067   for the three months ended   September     30, 2015 to $1  0  ,  425   for the three months ended   September     30, 2016. Our borrowings have increased in total between   September     30, 2015 and   September     30  , 2016, as we have entered into a Second   and Third   Term Loan and also have increased draws from   our   Line of Credit primarily for acquisitions and to repay secured mortgage indebtedness.   We used our Line of Credit, and First,   Second   and Third   Term Loan  s   to pay down mortgage debt which bore a higher interest rate of interest  . A partial amount of o  ur consolidated mortgage debt, Line of Credit outstanding draws and a partial amount of our First Term Loan were all repaid w  ith proceeds from the disposition and simultaneous contribution of seven hotel properties to the joint venture with Cindat. This reduced our interest expense for the period from July 1, 2016 to September 30, 2016. 

Loss on Disposition of Hotel Properties 

During the three   months   ended   September     30,   2016, the Company recorded a   loss   of $  437   related to   the sale of the Hawthorn Suites, Franklin, MA. 

Unconsolidated Joint Venture Investments 

The income   from unconsolidated joint ventures consists of our interest in the operating results of the properties   we own in joint ventures. Income   from our   unconsolidated joint ventures de  creased by $  4,325 from income of $608 for the three months ended September     30, 2015 compared to a loss   of $  3,717   during the same period in 201  6. 

Income Tax Benefit 

During the     three     months ended     September     30  , 2016, the Company     recorded an income tax benefit   of $1,  443     compared to an income tax benefit of $631     for the   three   months   ended     September     30  , 2015. 

Net Income   Applicable to Common Shareholders 

Net income   applicable to common shareholders for the   three   months ended   September     30, 2016   was   $3,577 compared to income   of $  10,570   during the same   period in 201  5  .      This decrease   was   primarily caused by a loss of contributions from hotel properties that were sold, loss recorded from unconsolidated joint venture investments and an increase in our   dividends paid on our preferred shares  .  Offsett  ing this decrease in net income   was an increase to our income tax benefit and decrease in interest expense recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. 

Comprehensive Income   Attr  ibutable to Common Shareholders 

Comprehensive income attributable to common shareholders for the three months ended   September     30, 2016   was $3,  730   compared to comprehensive income of $10,501 for the same period in 2015. For the three months ended September     30, 2016, we recorded comprehensive income of $8,  358   compared to $14,334 for the three months ended September     30, 2015.

Revenue 

Our total revenues for the     nine     months ended     September     30, 2016 consisted of hotel operating revenues and other revenue. Hotel operating revenues were approximately 99.9% of total revenues for the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2016 and 2015. Hotel operating revenues are recorded for wholly owned hotels that are leased to our wholly owned TRS and hotels owned through joint venture interests that are consolidated in our financial statements. Hotel operating revenues increased $7,815, or   2  .3%, to $354,991     for the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2016 compared to $347,176     for the same period in 2015. This increase in hotel operating revenues was primarily attributable to the acquisition of hotel properties consummated during or subsequent to the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2015 and the continued growth and stabilization of our existing assets offset by the impact of the hotels contributed to the joint venture with Cindat. Acquisitions contributed $39,527   in   incremental revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, while the contribution of seven hotels to our joint venture with Cindat caused a decrease in revenue by   $40,575 d  uring the same period.

We acquired interests in the following hotel during the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2015: 

Offsetting these acquisitions is our contribution of the seven properties to the joint venture with Cindat.

Expenses 

Total hotel operating expenses increased   5  .6% to approximately $198,397     for the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2016 from $187,862     for the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2015. Consistent with the increase in hotel operating revenues, hotel operating expenses increased primarily due to the acquisitions consummated since September 30, 2015, as mentioned above. The acquisitions also resulted in an increase in depreciation and amortization of   3  .4%, or $1,864, to $57,259     for the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2016 from $55,395     for the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2015.

With the disposition of the hotels contributed to the joint venture with Cindat, hotel operating expenses, depreciation and amortization, and real estate and property insurance decreased   by $17,190, $4,129   and   $4,  102, respectively.  

General and administrative expense increased   18  .5%, or     by approximately $2,689,     from $14,566     in the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2015 to $17,255     for the same period in 2016.  General and administrative expense includes expense related to non-cash share based payments issued as incentive compensation to the Company s trustees, executives, and employees.  Expense related to     share based compensation increased $1,188     when comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the same period in 2015.   This increase in share based compensation expense is primarily related to the issuance of share awards under the 2013 Multi-Year LTIP during the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 as the performance peri  od ended December 31, 2015.

The increase in interest expense is primarily due to increased borrowings drawn on the Second Term Loan during the third and fourth quarters of 2015, and the Third Term Loan during the third quarter of 2016.  These borrowings were used to acquire hotel properties and to pay down consolidated mortgage debt.   

Gain on Disposition of Hotel Properties 

During the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016, the Company recorded a   net   gain of $  94,839 related to the Cindat joint v  enture transaction   and the sales of the Hyatt Place, King of Prussia, PA and Hawthorn Suites, Franklin, MA  . Please refer to  Note 3   Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information about the Cindat joint venture. 

Unconsolidated Joint Venture Investments 

The income from unconsolidated joint ventures consists of our interest in the operating results of the properties we own in joint ventures. Income from our unconsolidated joint ventures decreased by     $3,270     to a loss of $2,410     for the nine months ended Septe  mber 30, 2016 compared to income   of $860 during the same period in 2015,   due to the income we recognized on our preferred equity interest in the Cindat joint venture, and   by improvements in the markets of the hotels owned by our unconsolidated joint venture investments, particularly the Boston market where two of these hotels are located. 

Income Tax Benefit 

During the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2016, the Company     recorded an income tax benefit   of $4,  513     compared to an income tax benefit of $740     for the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2015. 

Net Income     Applicable to Common Shareholders 

Net income     applicable to common shareholders for the     nine     months ended     September   30, 201  6     w  as     $  94,445     compared to     income     of $  18  ,  667     during the same     period in 201  5  .    This increase in net   income   was   primarily caused by     the net gain of $94,839 realized on the Cindat joint venture transaction and the sales of the Hyatt Place, King of Prussia, PA and the Hawthorn Suites, Franklin, MA.   Please refer to  Note   3       Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures    of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for   more information about the Cindat joint venture  . 

Comprehensive Income Attributable to Common Shareholders 

Comprehensive income attributable to common shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $94,  377     compared to comprehensive income of $17,977 for the same period in 2015. This amount was primarily attributable to gains on disposition of hotel properties as more fully described above. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded comprehensive income of $114,  677     compared to $28,950 of comprehensive income for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   The increase in comprehensive income was primarily due to the $8  5  ,  105   increase in net income.

LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES, AND EQUITY OFFERINGS 

(dollars in thousands, except per share data) 

Potential Sources of Capital 

Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors, including the current state of the overall credit markets, our degree of leverage and borrowing restrictions imposed by existing lenders. Our ability to raise funds through the issuance of debt and equity securities is dependent upon, among other things, capital market volatility, risk tolerance of investors, general market conditions for REITs and market perceptions related to the Company s ability to generate cash flow and positive returns on its investments. 

In addition, our mortgage indebtedness contains various financial and non-financial covenants customarily found in secured, nonrecourse financing arrangements. If the specified criteria are not satisfied, the lender may be able to escrow cash flow generated by the property securing the applicable mortgage loan. We have determined that certain debt service coverage ratio covenants contained in the loan agreements securing   two   of our hotel properties were not met as of   September 30  , 201  6  . Pursuant to the loan agreements, certain lenders have elected to escrow the operating cash flow for these properties. However, these covenants do not constitute an event of default for these loans. Future deterioration in market conditions could cause restrictions in our access to the cash flow of additional properties. 

We maintain a Credit Facility with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and various other lenders. The credit agreement provides for a $500,000 senior unsecured credit facility consisting of a $250,000 senior unsecured revolving line of credit and a $250,000 senior unsecured term loan. The Credit Facility expires on February 28, 2018 and, provided no event of default has occurred, we may request that the lenders renew the credit facility for an additional one-year period. The Credit Facility is also expandable to $850,000 at our request, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. On August 10, 2015, we entered into a $300,000 Second Term Loan   and on   with Citigroup Global Markets I  nc. and various other lenders. On August 3, 2016, we entered into a $200,000 Third Term Loan with Wells Fargo, N.A. and various other lenders. 

As of   September   30, 2016, the outstanding balance under the First Term Loan was $210,520, under the Second Term Loan was $300,000  , under the Third Term Loan was $102,000     and we had no     outstanding borrowings under the Line of Credit. As of   September   30, 2016, our remaining borrowing capacity under     the Credit Facility,   Second Term Loan   and Third Term Loan    w  as $  384,210   wh  ich is based on certain operating metrics of unencumbered hotel properties designated as borrowing base     assets. We intend to repay indebtedness incurred un  der the Credit Facility,   Second Term Loan   and Third Term Loan   out of cash flow and from the proceeds of issuances of additional common and preferred shares and potentially other securities and from proceeds from dispositions. 

We will continue to monitor our debt maturities to manage our liquidity needs. However, no assurances can be given that we will be successful in refinancing all or a portion of our future debt obligations due to factors beyond our control or that, if refinanced, the terms of such debt will not vary from the existing terms. As of September 30, 2016, we   have $  678   of ind  ebtedness maturing on or before December 31, 2016. We currently expect that cash requirements for all debt that is not refinanced by our existing lenders for which the maturity date is not extended will be met through a combination of cash on hand, refinancing the existing debt with new lenders, draws on the Line of Credit and the issuance of our securities. 

In addition to the incurrence of debt and the offering of equity securities, dispositions of property or investment from a joint venture partner may serve as additional capital resources and sources of liquidity. We may recycle capital from stabilized assets, as evidenced by our recently completed transaction involving the JV Properties, or from sales of non-core hotels in secondary and tertiary markets.  Capital from these types of transactions is intended to be redeployed into high growth acquisitions, share buybacks, or to pay down existing debt. 

Common Share Repurchase Plan 

In October 2015, our Board o  f Trustees authorized our current   share repurchase program for up to $100,000 of common shares. For the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016, the Company repurchased 2,  605  ,  649   common shares for an aggregate purchase price of $  49  ,  051  . Upon repurchase by the Company, these common shares ceased to be outstanding and became authorized but unissued common shares. 

In October 2016, our Board of Trustees authorized a new share repurchase program for up to $100,000 of common shares which will commence upon the completion of the existing repurchase program.   The new program will expire on   December 31, 2017, unless extended by our Board of Trustees.

Acquisitions 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we acquired the following wholly-owned hotel properties: 

*Assumption of debt includes a $50 premium resulting from the determination that the stated rate of interest is above market rates on the date of acquisition 

**  Includes a  n intangible asset for a   lease-in-place of $648  ,   advance bookings of   $76 a  nd franchise fees of $150. 

***Includes a lease-in-place intangible asset of $126, below market lease liability of $319, advance bookings asset of $199, and franchise fees asset of $125. 

We intend to invest in additional hotels only as suitable opportunities arise and adequate sources of financing are available. We expect that future investments in hotels will depend upon and will be financed by, in whole or in part, our existing cash, the proceeds from additional issuances of common or preferred shares, proceeds from the sale of assets, issuances of Common Units, issuances of preferred units or other securities or borrowings     secured by hotel assets and under our Line of Credit. 

Operating Liquidity and Capital Expenditures 

We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations, existing cash balances and, if necessary, short-term borrowings under the   Line of Credit  . We believe that the net cash provided by operations in the coming year and borrowings drawn on the   Line of Credit   will be adequate to fund the Company s operating requirements, monthly recurring debt service and the payment of dividends in accordance with REIT requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 

To qualify as a REIT, we must distribute annually at least 90% of our taxable income. This distribution requirement limits our ability to retain earnings and requires us to raise additional capital in order to grow our business and acquire additional hotel properties. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to borrow funds or raise additional equity capital on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to make distributions to our shareholders at the current rate or at all. Due to the seasonality of our business, cash provided by operating activities fluctuates significantly from quarter to quarter. However, we   believe that, based on our current estimates, which include the addition of cash   from operations   provided by hotels acquired during 201  6  , our cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient over the next 12 months to fund the payment of our dividend at its current level. However, our Board of Trustees continues to evaluate the dividend policy in the context of our overall liquidity and market conditions and may   elect to reduce o  r suspend these distributions.   Net cash provided by operating activities for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 was   $78,245   and cash used for the payment of distributions and dividends for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $  50  ,  987  . 

We also project that our operating cash flow and available borrowings under the Line of Credit will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity and other capital needs over the next twelve to eighteen months.  

Our long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of the costs of acquiring additional hotel properties, renovation and other non-recurring capital expenditures that need to be made periodically with respect to hotel properties and scheduled debt repayments. We will seek to satisfy these long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, including borrowings under the Line of Credit and through secured, non-recourse mortgage financings with respect to our unencumbered hotel properties. In addition, we may seek to raise capital through public or private offerings of our securities. Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to access these capital sources, including our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered hotel properties and borrowing restrictions imposed by lenders or franchisors. We will continue to analyze which source of capital is most advantageous to us at any particular point in time, but financing may not be consistently available to us on terms that are attractive, or at all.

Spending on capital improvements during the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 increased when compared to spending on capital improvements during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015. During the nine   months ended   September   30, 2016, we   spent $26,866   on capital expenditures to renovate, improve or replace assets at our hotels. This compares to $1  8  ,  841   during the   same period in 2015. These capital expenditures were undertaken to comply with brand mandated improvements and to initiate projects that we believe will generate a return on investment to take advantage of the continuing recovery in the lodging sector. 

In addition t  o capital reserves required under certain loan agreements and capital expenditures to renovate, improve or replace assets at our hotels, we have opportunistically engaged in hotel development projects. During the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016, we   spent $0 on hotel development projects compared to $  420   during   the   same period of 2015.  

We may spend additional amounts, if necessary, to comply with the requirements of any franchise license under which any of our hotels operate and otherwise to the extent we deem such expenditures to be   prudent  . We are also obligated to fund the cost of certain capital improvements to our hotels. We expect to use operating cash flow, borrowings under the Line of Credit, and proceeds from issuances of our securities to pay for the cost of capital improvements and any furniture, fixture and equipment requirements in excess of the set aside referenced above. 

CASH FLOW ANALYSIS 

(dollars in thousands, except per share data) 

Comparison of the   Nine   Months   Ended   September 30  , 2016   and 2015 

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased   $  9,142   from $87,387 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to   $  78,245     for the comparable period in 2016. Net income, adjusted for non-cash items reflected in the statement of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, decreased by $  6,304   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to 2015, partially driven by the disposition and subsequent contribution of seven hotel properties located in New York City to an unconsolidated joint venture with Cindat. Further, a net decrease in working capital assets provided additional cash from operating activities. 

Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $  185,372   compared to net cash used in investing activities of $81,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we received $  429,250   in proceeds from contributions of seven hotel properties to the Cindat joint venture and disposed of two additional hotel properties for $21,093. We did not have similar transactions during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Offsetting these sources of funds were $238,848 for the purchase of two hotel properties during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $61,415 for the purchase of two hotel properties during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   

Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $155,612 compared to net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $1,242. This is primarily due to $156,921 in repayments in borrowings under the Line of Credit, Term Loans and mortgages payable from proceeds from the disposition of seven hotel properties to the Cindat joint venture during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we received proceeds from borrowings under the Line of Credit and Term Loans of $245,000 and repayments of mortgages payable of $182,684 during the same period in 2015. In addition, we redeemed our Series B Preferred Shares in June 2016 for $115,000. Offsetting this was approximately $185,999 in proceeds from our Series D Preferred Shares offering. In addition, dividends and distributions payable decreased $2,746 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 2015, due to the reduction of dividends paid on common shares due to our common share repurchases, but offset by the increase in dividends paid on common shares as a result of our Series D Preferred Shares offering. 

OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

The Company does not have off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS 

(in thousands, except share data) 

The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ) developed Funds from Operations ( FFO ) as a non-GAAP financial measure of performance of an equity REIT in order to recognize that income-producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under GAAP. We calculate FFO applicable to common shares and Common Units in accordance with the April 2002 National Policy Bulletin of NAREIT, which we refer to as the White Paper. The White Paper defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated assets, plus certain non-cash items, such as loss from impairment of assets and depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Our interpretation of the NAREIT definition is that noncontrolling interest in net income (loss) should be added back to (deducted from) net income (loss) as part of reconciling net income (loss) to FFO. Our FFO computation may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not compute FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, or that interpret the NAREIT definition differently than we do. 

The GAAP measure that we believe to be most directly comparable to FFO, net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders, includes loss from the impairment of certain depreciable assets, our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures and land, depreciation and amortization expenses, gains or losses on property sales, noncontrolling interest and preferred dividends. In computing FFO, we eliminate these items because, in our view, they are not indicative of the results from our property operations. We determined that the loss from the impairment of certain depreciable assets including investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and land, was driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of certain hotel properties and other assets as determined by our analysis of those assets in accordance with applicable GAAP. As such, these impairments have been eliminated   from net loss to determine FFO. 

FFO does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the Company s performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. We consider FFO to be a meaningful, additional measure of operating performance because it excludes the effects of the assumption that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, and because it is widely used by industry analysts as a performance measure. We show both FFO from consolidated hotel operations and FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures because we believe it is meaningful for the investor to understand the relative contributions from our consolidated and unconsolidated hotels. The display of both FFO from consolidated hotels and FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures allows for a detailed analysis of the operating performance of our hotel portfolio by management and investors. We present FFO applicable to common shares and Common Units because our Common Units are redeemable for common shares. We believe it is meaningful for the investor to understand FFO applicable to all common shares and Common Units.

The following table reconciles FFO for the periods presented to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income, for the same periods   (dollars in thousands): 

(1)      Adjustment made to add depreciation of purchase price in excess of historical cost of the assets in the unconsolidated joint venture at the time of our investment. 

(2)      Adjustment made to add our interest in real estate related depreciation and amortization of our unconsolidated joint ventures. Allocation of depreciation and amortization is consistent with allocation of income and loss. 

B  ased on guidance provided by NAREIT, we have eliminated loss from the impairment of certain depreciable assets, including investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and land, from net loss to arrive at FFO in each year presented. 

INFLATION 

Operators of hotel properties, in general, possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation. However, competitive pressures may limit the ability of our management companies to raise room rates.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

The estimates and assumptions made by management in applying critical accounting policies have not changed materially during 201  6   and 201  5   and none of the estimates or assumptions have proven to be materially incorrect or resulted in our recording any significant adjustments relating to prior periods. See Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 201  5   for a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. 

Revenue Recognition 

Approximately 100% of our revenues are derived from hotel room revenues and revenue from other hotel operating departments. We directly recognize revenue and expense for all consolidated hotels as hotel operating revenue and hotel operating expense when earned and incurred. These revenues are recorded net of any sales or occupancy taxes collected from our guests. All revenues are recorded on an accrual basis, as earned. We participate in frequent guest programs sponsored by the brand owners of our hotels and we expense the charges associated with those programs, as incurred. 

Other revenues consist primarily of fees earned for asset management services provided to hotels we own through unconsolidated joint ventures. Fees are earned as a percentage of hotel revenue and are recorded in the period earned. 

Investment in Hotel Properties 

Investments in hotel properties are recorded at cost. Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life of the asset. Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of up to 40 years for buildings and improvements, two to seven years for furniture, fixtures and equipment. We are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in hotel properties. These assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in hotel properties we would depreciate these investments over fewer years, resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis. 

I  dentifiable assets, liabilities,   and   noncon  trolling interests   related to hotel properties acquired in a business combination are recorded at full fair value. Estimating techniques and assumptions used in determining fair values involve significant estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments have a direct impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities which can directly impact the amount of depreciation expense recorded on an annual basis and could have an impact on our assessment of potential impairment of our investment in hotel properties. 

P  roperties intended to be sold are designated as  held for sale  on the balance sheet  .       In accordance with   ASU Update No. 2014-08 concerning the classification and reporting of discontinued operations  , we evaluate each disposition to determine whether we need to classify the disposition as discontinued operations.   This amendment defines discontinued operations as a component of an entity that represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity s operations and financial re  sults. W  e anticipate that most of our hotel dispositions will not be classified as discontinued operations as most will not fit this definition.

Based on the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances, we review the recoverability of the property s carrying value. Such events or changes in circumstances include the following: 

a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset;     

a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used or in its physical condition;     

a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long-lived asset, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;     

an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset;     

a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset; and     

a current expectation that, it is more likely than not that, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.     

We review our portfolio on an on-going basis to evaluate the existence of any of the aforementioned events or changes in circumstances that would require us to test for recoverability. In general, our review of recoverability is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property s use and eventual disposition. These estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value expected, as well as the effects of hotel demand, competition and other factors. If impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. We are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the values of our investments in hotel properties. 

As of   September 30, 2016  , based on our analysis, we have determined that the   estimated   future cash flow of each of the properties in our portfolio is sufficient to recover its carrying value. 

Investment in Joint Ventures 

Properties owned in joint ventures are consolidated if the determination is made that we are the primary beneficiary in a variable interest entity (VIE) or we maintain control of the asset through our voting interest or other rights in the operation of the entity. To determine if we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we evaluate whether we have a controlling financial interest in that VIE. An enterprise is deemed to have a controlling financial interest if it has i) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance, and ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could be significant to the VIE or the rights to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. Control can also be demonstrated by the ability of a member to manage day-to-day operations, refinance debt and sell the assets of the partnerships without the consent of the other member and the inability of the members to replace the managing member. This evaluation requires significant judgment. 

If it is determined that we do not have a controlling interest in a joint venture, either through our financial interest in a VIE or our voting interest in a voting interest entity, the equity method of accounting is used. Under this method, the investment, originally recorded at cost, is adjusted to recognize our share of net earnings or losses of the affiliates as they occur rather than as dividends or other distributions are received, limited to the extent of our investment in, advances to and commitments for the investee. Pursuant to our joint venture agreements, allocations of profits and losses of some of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be allocated disproportionately as compared to nominal ownership percentages due to specified preferred return rate thresholds. 

The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of its investment in unconsolidated joint ventures to determine if circumstances exist indicating impairment to the carrying value of the investment that is other than temporary. When an impairment indicator is present, we will estimate the fair value of the investment. Our estimate of fair value takes into consideration factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. This determination requires significant estimates by management, including the expected cash flows to be generated by the assets owned and operated by the joint venture. Subsequent changes in estimates could impact the determination of whether impairment exists. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of our investment in the unconsolidated joint venture.

Accounting for Derivative Financial Investments and Hedging Activities 

We use derivatives to hedge, fix and cap interest rate risk and we account for our derivative and hedging activities by recording all derivative instruments at fair value on the balance sheet. Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. We formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction. Cash flow hedges that are considered highly effective are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability, with a corresponding amount recorded in other comprehensive income within shareholders  equity. Amounts are reclassified from other comprehensive income to the income statements in the period or periods the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. 

Under cash flow hedges, derivative gains and losses not considered highly effective in hedging the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized immediately in the income statement. For hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short-cut method, at the hedge s inception and on a regular basis thereafter, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future. 

New Accounting Pronouncements 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share  -Based Award Payment Accounting  , which simplifies various     aspects of how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. This standard requires companies to record all of the tax     effects related to share-based payments through the income statement, allows companies to elect an accounting policy to either estimate the share based     award forfeitures (and expense) or account for forfeitures (and expense) as they occur, and allows companies to withhold   a percentage of   the shares   issuable   upon settlement of an award up to the maximum individual     statutory tax rate without causing the award to be classified as   a    liability. The new standard is effective for the Company     on January 1, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2016-09 will have on its consolidated financial     statements and related disclosures. 

We adopted ASU No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, on January 1, 2016.  This standard requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability.  Previously, debt issuance costs were recorded as an asset.  The issuance costs will continue to be amortized over the life of the debt instrument and recorded in interest expense, as they were prior to the new standard.  As part of this adoption, debt issuance costs are now included as an offset to the mortgages, unsecured term loan and unsecured notes payable line items on the consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented. For full reclassification amounts, see  Note 5   Debt . 

On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.  The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective.  The new standard is effective for the Company on January 1, 201  8  .  Early adoption   is permitted, but not prior to the original effective date of January 1, 2017  .  The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.  The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.    The Company continues to evaluate this standard and the impact it will have, if any, on our ongoing financial reporting. 

On Januar  y 1, 2016, we adopted ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.  We   evaluated the application of ASU No. 2015-02 and concluded that no change was required to our accounting of our interests in less than wholly owned joint ventures.  However, HHLP, our operating partnership, now meets the criteria as a variable interest entity.  The Company s most significant asset is its investment in HHLP, and consequently, substantially all of the Company s assets and liabilities represent those assets and liabilities of HHLP. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842),   which requires lessees to record operating and financing leases as assets and     liabilities on the balance sheet and lessors to expense costs that are not initial direct leasing costs. This standard will be effective for the first annual reporting     period beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements     and related disclosures.

Item 3.      Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (in thousands, except per share data) 

Our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt. As of   September 30, 2016  , we are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to varia  ble rate borrowings under our Credit Facility, Second   Term   and Third Term Loan  s     and certain variable rate mortgages and notes payable. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had total variable rate debt outstanding of $  676,318   with a weight  ed average interest rate of 2.86  %. The effect of a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the interest rate on our variable rate debt outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   would be an increase or decrease in our inter  est expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $1,549 and $4,936  . 

Our interest rate risk objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for a portion of our borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements. We have also entered into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or caps, and in the future may enter into treasury options or locks, to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to effectively lock the interest rate on a portion of our variable rate debt. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have an interest rate cap related to debt on the Hyatt Union Square, New York, NY   and   Courtya  rd, LA Westside, Culver City, CA  , and we have four   interest rate swaps related to debt on the Duane Street Hotel, New York, NY,   Hilton Garden Inn, 52  nd   Street, New York, NY   and   portions of our First Term Loan  . We do not intend to enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. 

As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   45  % of our outstanding consolidated long-term indebtedness is subject to fixed rates or effectively capped, while   55  % of our outstanding long term indebtedness is subject to floating rates, including borrowings under our   Credit Facility, Second Term Loan and Third Term Loan  . 

Changes in market interest rates on our fixed-rate debt impact the fair value of the debt, but such changes have no impact on interest expense incurred. If interest rates rise 100 basis points and our fixed rate debt balance remains constant, we expect the fair value of our debt to decrease. The sensitivity analysis related to our fixed-rate debt assumes an immediate 100 basis point move in interest rates from their   September 30, 2016   levels, with all other variables held constant. A 100 basis point increase in market   interest rates would cause the fair value of our fixed-rate debt outstanding at September 30, 2016 to be approximately $1,054,197 and a 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates would cause the fair value of our fixed-rate debt outstanding at September 30, 2016 to be approximately $1,070  ,861  . 

We regularly review interest rate exposure on our outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations. For debt obligations outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  , the following table presents expected principal repayments and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates:

Item 4.      Controls and Procedures 

Based on the most recent evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer believe the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) were effective as of     September   30  , 2016  . 

There were no changes to the Company s internal controls over financial reporting during the   three   months ended   September   30  , 2016  , that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting.

Item 1A.      Risk Factors. 

Economic conditions may reduce demand for hotel properties and adversely affect the Company s profitability. 

The performance of the lodging industry is highly cyclical and has traditionally been closely linked with the performance of the general economy and, specifically, growth in the U.S. gross domestic product, employment, and investment and travel demand. The Company cannot predict the pace or duration of the global economic cycle or the cycles of the lodging industry. In the event conditions in the industry deteriorate or do not continue to see sustained improvement, or there is an extended period of economic weakness, the Company s occupancy rates, revenues and profitability could be adversely affected. In addition, other macroeconomic factors, such as consumer confidence and conditions which negatively shape public perception of travel, may have a negative effect on the lodging industry and may adversely affect the Company s business. Furthermore, some of the Company s hotels are classified as upper upscale or upscale. In an economic downturn, these types of hotels may be more susceptible to a decrease in revenue, as compared to hotels in other categories that have lower room rates. This characteristic may result from the fact that upper upscale hotels generally target business and high-end leisure travelers. In periods of economic difficulties, business and leisure travelers may seek to reduce travel costs by limiting travel or seeking to reduce costs on their trips. In addition, in periods of weak demand, as may occur during a general economic recession, profitability is negatively affected by the relatively high fixed costs of operating upper upscale and upscale hotels. Consequently, any uncertainty in the general economic environment could adversely affect the Company s business. 

Item 2.      Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 

The following is a table   summary of our common share repurchases during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   under the $100 million repurchase program authorized by our Board of Trustees in   October 2015  .     All such common shares were repurchased pursuant to open market transactions. 

In October 2016, our Board of Trustees authorized a new share repurchase program for up to $100,000 of common shares which will commence upon the completion of the existing repurchase program.   The new share repurchase program will expire on   December 31, 2017, unless extended by our Board of Trustees.
