NOTE 1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES  

A summary of the significant accounting policies
applied in the preparation of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements follows. 

General  

The accompanying unaudited condensed financial
statements of Iris Biotechnologies, Inc., (the  Company ), have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations
(Regulation S-X) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule
8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting
principles for complete financial statements. 

In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Accordingly, the results
from operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results that
may be expected for the year ended December 31, 2016. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read
in conjunction with the December 31, 2015 financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s Form 10-K
filed on March 30, 2016. 

Business and Basis of Presentation  

Iris Biotechnologies Inc. (the  Company ,
 we ,  us ,  our ) was incorporated on February 16, 1999 under the laws of the State of California.
The Company efforts are principally devoted to developing solutions for the detection and monitoring of monogenic and complex genomic
diseases. The Company has generated minimal revenue to date and consequently its operations are subject to all risks inherent in
the establishment of a new business enterprise. 

On April 9, 2014, the Company formed Iris Wellness
Labs, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary and Delaware Corporation, for the purpose of developing certain business lines. During the
quarter ended September 30, 2016, Wellness Labs, Inc. began operations providing consulting and informational services to the medical
community. 

The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

For purposes of the Statements of Cash Flows,
the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity date of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 

Revenue recognition  

The Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification
(ASC) subtopic 605-10,   Revenue Recognition   effective for the period ended September 30, 2016. The Company
recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 605-10, which requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized:
(1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed or determinable; and
(4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management s judgments regarding
the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts
and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related
sales are recorded. 

ASC 605-10 incorporates Accounting Standards
Codification subtopic 605-25,   Multiple-Element Arrangements   ( ASC 605-25 ). ASC 605-25 addresses
accounting for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets.
The effect of implementing ASC 605-25 on the Company s financial position and results of operations was not significant. 

The Company revenue is generated by providing
analytical and scientific information to clients and physicians to assist in optimizing health and wellness. The service revenue
is recognized when those services have been completed or satisfied. 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
the Company had deferred revenues of $7,500 and $-0-, respectively. 

Property and Equipment  

Property and equipment are stated at cost.
When retired or otherwise disposed, the related carrying value and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts
and the net difference less any amount realized from disposition, is reflected in earnings. For financial statement purposes, property
and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of 3 to 5 years. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include the recoverability and useful lives of long-lived assets, the
fair value of the Company s stock, stock-based compensation, fair values relating to derivative liabilities and the valuation
allowance related to deferred tax assets. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

Income Taxes  

The Company follows Accounting Standards Codification
subtopic 740-10, Income Taxes ( ASC 740-10 ) for recording the provision for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities
using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled. Deferred
income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability during each period. If available evidence suggests
that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance
is required to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Future changes in such
valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income taxes in the period of change. Deferred income taxes may
arise from temporary differences resulting from income and expense items reported for financial accounting and tax purposes in
different periods. Deferred taxes are classified as current or non-current, depending on the classification of assets and liabilities
to which they relate. Deferred taxes arising from temporary differences that are not related to an asset or liability are classified
as current or non-current depending on the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse and relate primarily
to stock based compensation basis differences and Net Operating Losses.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company has provided
a 100% valuation against the deferred tax benefits. The periods from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2015 remain open to examination
by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and state authorities. 

Net Income (loss) Per Common Share  

The Company computes earnings (loss) per share
under Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 260-10, Earnings Per Share ( ASC 260-10 ). Net loss per common share
is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year.  Diluted
earnings per share, if presented, would include the dilution that would occur upon the exercise or conversion of all potentially
dilutive securities into common stock using the  treasury stock  and/or  if converted  methods as applicable. 

The computation of basic and diluted loss per
share as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 excludes potentially dilutive securities when their inclusion would be anti-dilutive, or
if their exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common stock during the period. 

Potentially dilutive securities excluded from
the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share are as follows: 

Concentrations of Credit Risk  

Financial instruments and related items, which
potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash. The Company places its cash with quality
credit institutions. At times, such amounts may be in excess of the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000. 

Fair Values  

Accounting Standards Codification subtopic
825-10, Financial Instruments ( ASC 825-10 ) requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments.
ASC 825-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities
required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it
would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent
risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance. ASC 825-10 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity
to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 825-10 establishes
three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1 - Quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2 - Observable inputs other
than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume
or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or
can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs to the
valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities. 

To the extent that valuation is based on models
or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. In certain
cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure
purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is disclosed and is determined based on
the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 

The carrying value of the Company s cash,
accounts payable, related party advances, short-term borrowings (including convertible notes payable), and other current assets
and liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term maturity. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
the Company did not have any items that would be classified as level 1 or 2 disclosures. 

The Company recognized its derivative liabilities
as level 3 and values its derivatives using the methods discussed in Note 5. While the Company believes that its valuation methods
are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, it recognizes that the use of different methodologies or assumptions
to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting
date. The primary assumptions that would significantly affect the fair values using the methods discussed in Note 5 are that of
volatility and market price of the underlying common stock of the Company. 

Stock based compensation  

The Company measures the cost of services received
in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award. For employees and directors, the fair value
of the award is measured on the grant date and for non-employees, the fair value of the award is generally re-measured on vesting
dates and interim financial reporting dates until the service period is complete. The fair value amount is then recognized over
the period during which services are required to be provided in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. Stock-based
compensation expense is recorded by the Company in the same expense classifications in the statements of operations, as if such
amounts were paid in cash. 

As of September 30, 2016, there were outstanding
stock options to purchase 1,387,696 shares of common stock, 1,004,363 shares of which were vested. As of December 31, 2015, the
Company had 1,957,571 options outstanding to purchase shares of common stock, of which 1,402,467 were vested. 

Derivative Liability  

The Company accounts for derivatives in accordance
with ASC 815, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, including
certain derivative instruments embedded in other financial instruments or contracts and requires recognition of all derivatives
on the balance sheet at fair value, regardless of hedging relationship designation. Accounting for changes in fair value of the
derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives qualify as hedge relationships and the types of relationships designated
are based on the exposures hedged. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any derivative instruments
that were designated as hedges. 

At December 31, 2015 through March 18, 2016,
the Company had a derivative liability due to the possibility of exceeding their common shares authorized when considering the
number of possible shares that may be issuable to satisfy settlement provisions for all existing instruments that could be settled
in shares. At March 18, 2016, upon increasing the number of common shares authorized, the fair value of the derivative liability
was reclassified to equity. See Note 5. 

Research and development costs  

The Company accounts for research and development
costs in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 730-10, Research and Development ( ASC 730-10 ).
Under ASC 730-10, all research and development costs must be charged to expense as incurred. Accordingly, internal research and
development costs are expensed as incurred. Third-party research and developments costs are expensed when the contracted work has
been performed or as milestone results have been achieved. Company-sponsored research and development costs related to both present
and future products are expensed in the period incurred. The Company incurred research and development expenditures of $31,453
and $100,931 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively and $23,483 and $100,840 for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 

Liquidity and Dependency of Key Management  

To date the Company has just begun to generate
revenues, has incurred expenses, and has sustained losses. As shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the
Company incurred a loss of $874,590 and $688,314 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the
period from February 16, 1999 (date of inception) through September 30, 2016, the Company has accumulated losses of $12,916,897.
Consequently, its operations are subject to all risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise. 

The Company's primary
source of operating funds since inception has been cash proceeds from the private placements of common stock and proceeds from
private placements of convertible debt.  The Company intends to raise additional capital through private placements of debt
and equity securities, but there can be no assurance that these funds will be available on terms acceptable to the Company, or
will be sufficient to enable the Company to fully complete its development activities or sustain operations. 

The future success or failure of the Company
is dependent primarily upon the Company raising funds from third parties, and the continued efforts and financial support of Simon
Chin, the Company s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and the majority sharehold e r. As in the past,
Mr. Chin has committed to provide all necessary funding if needed to the meet the Company s financial obligations through
2016. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

There are various updates recently issued,
most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not
expected to a have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

NOTE 2 - PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT  

Property, plant and equipment at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows: 

NOTE 3 - LONG TERM CONVERTIBLE NOTE PAYABLE  

Long-term debt at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015 are as follows:  

On June 17, 2016, the Company issued a $10,000
note to an unrelated party, unsecured and bearing an interest rate of 7.5% per annum, due five years from date of issuance. The
note is convertible into the Company s common stock at a conversion rate of $1.00 per share. Based upon the value of the
stock, an embedded beneficial conversion feature was not present in the note. 

NOTE 4   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

Officer Advances  

The Company s President and shareholders
have advanced funds on a non-interest-bearing basis to the Company for working capital purposes since the Company s inception
in February 1999.  No formal repayment terms or arrangements exist. During 2016, the Company's President advanced funds
of $115,500 to the Company. There were $290,700 and $175,200 outstanding at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

NOTE 5   DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES  

Excessive committed shares  

Beginning on December 29, 2015 through March
18, 2016, in connection with the previously issued convertible debt, stock options and warrants, the Company had the possibility
of exceeding their common shares authorized when considering the number of possible shares that may be issuable to satisfy settlement
provisions of these agreements after consideration of all existing instruments that could be settled in shares. This resulted
in a derivative liability as a result of the Company having a potential to settle the obligation to issue these excess shares.
The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments required that the Company reclassify the derivative from equity to
a liability at their fair values as of the date possible issuable shares exceeded the authorized level and at fair value as of
each subsequent balance sheet date. On March 18, 2016, the Company amended the Articles of Incorporation to increase of authorized
shares of common stock from 20,000,000 to 100,000,000 thereby having sufficient authorized common shares to meet any settlement
provisions. 

The Company recognized its derivative
liabilities as level 3 and values its derivatives using the methods discussed below. While the Company believes that its valuation
methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, it recognizes that the use of different methodologies or
assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at
the reporting date. The primary assumptions that would significantly affect the fair values using the methods discussed are that
of volatility and market price of the underlying common stock of the Company. 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the fair value of the net derivative liabilities reclassified to equity of $6,723 was determined using the Black Scholes
Option Pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend yield: 0%; volatility: 404.69%; risk free rate: 1.55%; and expected
life: 7.71 years. 

At March 18, 2016, the fair value of the derivative
liabilities of $450,297 was determined using the Black Scholes Option Pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend yield:
0%; volatility: 406.32%; risk free rate: 0.62% to 1.88%; and expected life: 1.00 to 8.80 years. 

The following table provides a summary of changes
in fair value of the Company s Level 3 financial liabilities as of nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

Fluctuations in the Company s stock price
are a primary driver for the changes in the derivative valuations during each reporting period. The Company s stock price
increased by 122% from December 31, 2015 to March 18, 2016. As the stock price increases for each of the related derivative instruments,
the value to the holder of the instrument generally increases, therefore increasing the liability on the Company s consolidated
balance sheet. Additionally, stock price volatility is one of the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement
of each of the Company s derivative instruments. The simulated fair value of these liabilities is sensitive to changes in
the Company s expected volatility. Increases in expected volatility would generally result in higher fair value measurement. 

NOTE 6 - STOCKHOLDER EQUITY  

On March 18, 2016, the Company amended its
Articles of Incorporation by filing a Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State of California to effect an increase
in the number of the Company s authorized common shares and preferred shares from 20,000,000 to 100,000,000 and 5,000,000
to 25,000,000 respectively. 

Preferred stock  

From date of inception through September 30,
2016, the Company has not issued any preferred shares. 

Common stock  

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015
the Company has 20,877,844 and 19,607,177 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, respectively. 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company issued an aggregate of 159,000 shares of common stock for services in the amount of $40,907 based on quoted market
prices at the time of issuance. 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company sold an aggregate of 70,000 shares of common stock for net proceeds of $14,000. 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company issued 1,041,667 shares of common stock for officer compensation in the amount of $125,000 based on the quoted
market price at the time of issuance. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company accrued
the subsequent issuances of 416,667 shares of common stock for officer compensation at a fair value of $83,333. 

At September 30, 2016 the Company accrued the
subsequent issuance of 37,500 shares of Board of Directors compensation at a fair value of $5,210, and 36,000 shares of legal and
consulting services at a fair value of $3,006.    

NOTE 7   WARRANTS AND OPTIONS  

Warrants  

The following table summarizes warrants outstanding
and related prices for the shares of the Company s common stock issued at September 30, 2016: 

Transactions involving the Company s
warrant issuance are summarized as follows: 

On January 1, 2016, the Company issued an aggregate
of 95,000 warrants for services with an exercise price of $1.00 with vesting over one year and expiring five years from issuance.
The fair value of the vested warrants during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $1,489 and $13,323, and $5,248
and $18,170 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, (as determined as described below) was charged
to operations. 

The fair value of these vesting 2016 warrants
issued and the significant assumptions used to determine those fair values, using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model are as follows: 

__________________________ 

 (a) The expected option life is based on contractual
expiration dates 

Options  

Option
valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions. The fair value of stock-based payment awards was estimated
using the Black-Scholes option model with a volatility figure derived from using the Company s historical stock prices. Management
determined this assumption to be a more accurate indicator of value. The Company accounts for the expected life of options based
on the contractual life of options for non-employees. For employees, the Company accounts for the expected life of options based
on remaining contractual expiration dates.   

The risk-free
interest rate was determined from the implied yields of U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with a remaining life consistent with the
expected term of the options.  The fair value of stock-based payment awards during the nine months ended September 30, 2016
was estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing model.  

In addition,
the Company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest.
In estimating the Company s forfeiture rate, the Company analyzed its historical forfeiture rate, the remaining lives of
unvested options, and the number of vested options as a percentage of total options outstanding. If the Company s actual
forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate, or if the Company reevaluates the forfeiture rate in the future, the
stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what the Company has recorded in the current period.   

Based on no historical forfeitures, the Company
estimated forfeitures related to option grants at a weighted average annual rate of 0% per year based on historical data,
for options granted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Employee Options  

The following table summarizes options outstanding
and the related prices for the shares of the Company s common stock issued to employees under a stock option plan at September
30, 2016: 

Transactions involving employee stock options issued are summarized
as follows:  

The fair value of the vested portion previously
granted employee options of $45,204 and $139,319 was charged during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and $47,057
and $149,591 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 

Non-employee options  

The following table summarizes the changes
in options outstanding and the related prices for the shares of the Company s common stock issued to non-employees under
a stock option plan at September 30, 2016: 

Transactions involving non-employee stock options
issued are summarized as follows: 

The fair value (as determined as described
below) of the non-employee options of $1,219 and $4,359 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and $3,281 and
$11,688 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was charged to operations, respectively. 

The fair value of these options issued and
the significant assumptions used to determine those fair values, using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model are as follows: 

NOTE 8 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  

From time to time, the Company is involved
in various litigation matters in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these
matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 

In 2016 upon settlement, the Company reversed
a prior service obligation of $50,000 as a reduction in current period operating expenses. 

NOTE 9 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  

In November 2016, the Company issued 24,000
shares of Common Stock for legal fees, 416,667 shares of Common Stock for officer compensation, 37,500 shares of Common Stock for
Board fees and 12,000 shares of Common Stock for consulting services. (See Note 6) 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Forward-Looking Statements  

The information in this
report contains forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact made in this report are forward
looking. In particular, the statements herein regarding industry prospects and future results of operations or financial position
are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as  believes, 
 estimates,   could,   possibly,   probably,  anticipates,   projects, 
 expects,   may,   will,  or  should  or other variations or similar words. No
assurances can be given that the future results anticipated by the forward-looking statements will be achieved. Forward-looking
statements reflect management s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Our actual results may differ significantly
from management s expectations. 

The following discussion
and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, included herewith. This
discussion should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future, or that
any conclusion reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future. Such discussion represents
only the best present assessment of our management. 

Overview  

Since inception on February
16, 1999 through September 30, 2016, we have sustained cumulative net losses of $12,916,897. Our losses have resulted primarily
from research and development expenses, patent costs and legal and accounting expenses. From inception through September 30, 2016,
we have minimal revenue from operations. We expect to incur additional losses to perform further research and development activities.
In order to accelerate our product introduction and to grow dynamically, we will need to raise additional funds. We do not currently
have any commercial products. With additional funding, we expect to launch our Nano-biochip products in the future. During the
third quarter of 2016, we began operations with Iris Wellness Labs, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, by providing consulting
services. As such we generated $595 in revenues and $7,500 in deferred revenues in the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 

In 2008, Iris was recognized
with Frost and Sullivan s North American Technology Innovation Award in Pharmacogenomics. It was quite an honor for Iris
to receive this award. 

In October 2010, Iris was
awarded $245,000, the maximum amount given per grant under the US Qualifying Therapeutic Discovery Project (QTDP) Program. The
QTDP grant provided recognition of Iris's patented Nano-Biochip  and BioWindows  Medical Informatics System for optimizing
personalized and targeted medical treatment. 

The selection criteria includes
a company s ability to diagnose diseases or conditions; to determine molecular factors related to diseases or conditions
by developing molecular diagnostic guided therapeutic decisions; or to develop a product, process, or technology to further the
delivery or administration of therapeutics. The award was given to projects that show reasonable potential to result in new therapies
to treat areas of unmet medical needs or to prevent, detect or treat chronic or acute diseases and conditions; to reduce long-term
health care costs in the U.S.; or to significantly advance the goal of curing cancer within the next 30 years. 

In 2014, Iris received the
IAIR Award for Best Company for Leadership in Personalized Medicine. Iris is in preparation for the launch of multiple products
and services based upon its patented Nano-biochip and BioWindows Medical Informatics System. We currently have six US patents plus
a portfolio of patents issued worldwide. The Company has been keeping up and making adjustments to our products and technology,
as well as to our intellectual property portfolio to stay at the forefront of its market sector. 

The Company has an extensive
pipeline of personalized, precision medical products and services, including an integrated blood test, IVF applications, a BreastCancerChip,
ColonCancerChip, NeuroChip, PrenatalChip, Comprehensive CancerChip, CardioChip, ViralChip and MetabolicChip; however, we have focused
our initial efforts on helping breast cancer patients. 

We have been in discussions
with various entities in regard to launching our products in the US and abroad. We have also had discussions with equipment financing
sources with respect to building or buying additional equipment, which would allow us to expand our manufacturing capacity. 

With the addition of outstanding
people, who have a passion for making a difference in helping people through precision medicine, we have positioned ourselves well
to offer our solution to the world as we prepare for dynamic growth. 

There are some risks with
respect to clinical testing, regulatory approval and review cycles and uncertainty of the costs. Net positive cash inflows from
any products developed may take several years to achieve. Management plans to continue financing operations with a combination
of equity issuances and debt arrangements. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of,
or eliminate our research or development programs, or cease operations. 

History  

We were incorporated in
the State of California on February 16, 1999 and planned to sell theranostic (choosing therapy based upon personalized diagnostic
results) products and services in the medical field. In an effort to develop that business, we set up operations in three locations
in California - Headquarters in Santa Clara (near Stanford University), Laboratory in San Leandro (near UC Berkeley and UC San
Francisco), and Analytical and Scientific Consulting Services in Davis (near UC Davis). 

Beginning on March 11, 1999,
Simon Chin, MBA, our founder, President and CEO, Secretary and principal shareholder, entered into Common Stock Purchase Agreements
with various companies, investment groups and private individuals. On March 1, 2003, Daniel Farnum, M.D., an owner of Humboldt
Orthopedics and a key shareholder, and Grace Osborne, MBA, President of GCO Recruiting, joined Mr. Chin on our board of directors.
On April 9, 2003, the board approved a 2 for 1 stock split, changed the authorized shares of common stock from 10 million to 20
million, and the authorized preferred stock remained at 5 million shares. On November 14, 2014, Douglas Hendren, M.D., MBA, was
elected to the Iris board of directors. On March 18, 2016, the Company amended its articles of incorporation and increased its
authorized shares of common stock to 100,000,000 and preferred stock to 25,000,000. 

On April 9, 2014, Iris created
its services subsidiary, Iris Wellness Labs, which began generating revenues by September 30, 2016. 

Plan of Operation  

We are a life science company
focused on the development and commercialization of Nano-Biochips  and an artificial intelligence system to assist in establishing
the foundation for personalized medicine, which will initially be utilized in the treatment of breast cancer. The Nano-Biochips 
have the ability to quickly and very accurately analyze the activity of multiple genes involved in a specific disease. Our manufacturing
system has the capability to produce a variety of chips with a choice of mRNA, microRNA, protein, or other biomarker probes for
the diagnosis and prognosis of many diseases. Although we may market our products as CLIA laboratory tests, we are designing them
to be approved by the FDA, which can then be used in any certified laboratory. Starting at the point of a breast biopsy diagnosis
of cancer, the Nano-Biochip and informatics program are designed to enable a treating physician to quickly prescribe a personalized
treatment regimen that will have the greatest probability of success for each patient s particular type of cancer. Our product
platform is being developed to lead to more effective diagnosis and treatment not only for patients with breast cancer, but also
for those with neurological disorders, heart disease, diabetes, metabolic problems, and other diseases. 

Product Research and Development  

We anticipate spending,
in order to accelerate our growth, which is contingent upon raising additional funds, at least $2,000,000 for product research
and development activities related to our anticipated product launches during the next twelve months. 

Acquisition of Plant and Equipment and Other
Assets  

We do not anticipate the
sale of any material property, plant or equipment during the next 12 months. We do anticipate the acquisition of some material
property, plant or equipment during the next 12 months, to accelerate our growth to fulfill the unmet needs of a large, growing
market. 

Number of Employees  

From our inception through
September 30, 2016, we have principally relied on the services of outside consultants and part-time employees for services. We
currently have 7 full-time and part-time employees and 6 full-time and part-time consultants. In order for us to attract and retain
quality personnel, we anticipate we will have to offer competitive salaries to future employees. We anticipate that it may become
desirable to add additional full and or part time employees to discharge certain critical functions during the next 12 months.
This projected increase in personnel is dependent upon our ability to generate revenues and obtain sources of financing. There
is no guarantee that we will be successful in raising the funds required or generating revenues sufficient to fund the projected
increase in the number of employees. As we continue to expand, we will incur additional cost for personnel. 

Results of Operations  

Beginning in the quarter
ended September 30, 2016, we began generating revenues through our Iris Wellness Labs, Inc. subsidiary. However, the risks specifically
discussed are not the only factors that could affect future performance and results. In addition to the discussion in this prospectus
concerning us, our business and our operations contain forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are necessarily
speculative and there are certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those
referred to in such forward-looking statements. We do not have a policy of updating or revising forward-looking statements and
thus it should not be assumed that silence by our Management over time means that actual events or results are occurring as estimated
in the forward-looking statements herein. 

From our inception through
September 30, 2016, we have generated minimal revenues and have incurred cumulative losses of $12,916,897. In addition, a significant
part of the overall remaining costs are associated principally with equity-based compensation to employees and consultants, research
and development costs and professional services rendered. 

We have yet to earn significant
revenues from operations. We may experience fluctuations in operating results in future periods due to a variety of factors, including
our ability to obtain additional financing in a timely manner and on terms favorable to us, our ability to successfully develop
our business model, the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the expansion of our business,
operations and infrastructure and the implementation of marketing programs, key agreements, and strategic alliances, and general
economic conditions specific to our industry. 

As a result of limited capital
resources and minimal revenues from operations since inception, we have relied on the issuance of equity securities
to employees and non-employees in exchange for services. Our management enters into equity compensation agreements with non-employees
if it is in our best interest under terms and conditions consistent with the requirements of Accounting Standards Codification
Subtopic 718-10 Compensation (ASC 718-10). In order to conserve our limited operating capital resources, we anticipate continuing
to compensate non-employees with equity for services during the next twelve months. This policy may have a material effect
on our results of operations during the next twelve months. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared
to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Revenues  

During the three months
ended September 30, 2016, we begun generating revenues from our wholly owned subsidiary, Wellness Labs, Inc. by providing medical
consulting services. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, our revenues were $595 as compared to -0- for the same period
last year. As we develop the business, we expect our revenue to grow over the next twelve months. 

Operating Expenses  

Selling, general and administrative
( SG A ) expenses decreased by $1,439 from $180,340 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $178,901 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016, primarily in labor and consulting fees, as well as certain other expenses controllable
by management. SG A expenses consisted of accounting, legal, consulting, public relations, startup and organizational expenses.
SG A expenses also included non-cash charges from the issuance of stock, warrants and stock options in the amounts of $141,215
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $66,187 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a period to period increase
of $75,028. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we utilized $27,186 cash for operations as compared to $82,625 for the
same period, last year, a $55,439 reduction. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we reduced labor expense and other
controllable expenses such as consulting and travel expenses, as compared to the same period last year. We used stock in lieu of
cash to conserve our cash resources. 

Research and development
costs increased from $23,483 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $31,453 for the three months ended September 30,
2016. The Company s expenditures for research and development are dependent on available resources and future expenditures
are expected to increase with additional financing. 

Other income (expense)  

 We recorded interest expense
of $677 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to interest expense of $500 for the same period, last year. Interest
expense is comprised of interest on our long-term convertible notes.  

As a result of the
above-mentioned expenses, net loss increased by $5,147 from $207,280 in three months ended September 30, 2015 to $212,427 in the
three months ended September 30, 2016. 

  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared
to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Revenues  

During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, we begun generating revenues from our wholly owned subsidiary, Wellness Labs, Inc. by providing medical consulting
services. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our revenues were $595 as compared to -0- for the same period last year.
As we develop the business, we expect our revenue to grow over the next twelve months. 

Operating Expenses  

Selling, general and administrative
( SG A ) expenses decreased by $102,428 from $580,971 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $478,543
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily in labor and consulting fees, as well as certain other expenses controllable
by management. SG A expenses consisted of accounting, legal, consulting, public relations, startup and organizational expenses.
SG A expenses also included non-cash charges from the issuance of stock, warrants and stock options in the amounts of $414,455
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $411,265 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a period to period increase
of $3,190. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we utilized $149,387 cash for operations as compared to $333,033 for the
same period, last year, a $183,646 reduction. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we reduced labor expense and other
controllable expenses such as consulting and travel expenses, as compared to the same period last year. We used stock in lieu of
cash to conserve our cash resources. 

Research and development
costs increased from $100,840 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $100,931 for the nine months ended September 30,
2016. The Company s expenditures for research and development are dependent on available resources and future expenditures
are expected to increase with additional financing. 

Other income (expense)  

 During the year ended December
31, 2015, we had the possibility of exceeding common shares authorized when considering the number of possible shares that may
be issuable to satisfy settlement provisions of these agreements after consideration of all existing instruments that could be
settled in shares. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires us to recognize the derivative liability
thereby reclassifying the amount from equity to a liability at the fair values as of the date possible issuable shares exceeded
the authorized level. At each subsequent balance sheet date the change in fair value is reflected in the statement of operations. 

On March 17, 2016, in preparation
for our multiple product launches, our board of directors unanimously approved the increase of our authorized shares of common
and preferred stock from 20 million and 5 million to 100 million and 25 million respectively. On March 18, 2016, our Amendment
to the Articles of Incorporation, regarding the increase in the authorized shares, was filed with the California Secretary of State.
The State of California has approved and recorded the amendment. 

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, we recorded a loss on change in fair value of these derivative liabilities of $287,938. We did not have a derivative
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. On March 18, 2016, upon increasing the number of authorized common shares, we reclassified
the then fair value from liability to equity. 

We recorded interest expense
of $1,679 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to interest expense of $1,568 for the same period, last year. Interest
expense is comprised of interest on our long-term convertible notes.  

As a result of the
above-mentioned expenses, net loss increased by $186,276 from $688,314 in nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $874,590 in
the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The net loss would have been lower if not for recording of a loss on change in fair
value of the derivative liabilities of $287,938 attributable to the Company s stock price having increased by 122% from
December 31, 2015 to March 18, 2016. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

As of September 30, 2016,
we had a working capital deficit of $433,137 as compared to a working capital deficit of $445,116 as of December 31, 2015. Our
cash position was $9,952 as of September 30, 2016 compared to $19,839 as of December 31, 2015. From the nine months ended September
30, 2016 we have incurred an operating cash flow deficit of $149,387, which has been principally financed through the private placement
of our common stock and cash infusions from the Founder. 

We expect to continue to
incur additional losses and negative cash flows from operating activities for the next year. As Iris Wellness Labs  revenue
and profit increase, we plan to be in a good cash flow position. 

Our available working capital
and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including progress of our subsidiary, our research and development
programs, our progress in and the cost of pre-clinical and clinical testing, the timing and cost of obtaining regulatory approvals,
the cost of filing and prosecuting patent claims and other intellectual property rights, completing technological and market developments,
current and future licensing relationships, the status of our competitors, and our ability to establish collaborative arrangements
with other organizations . 

Our continued operations
will depend on whether we are able to raise additional funds through various potential sources, such as equity and debt financing,
collaborative and licensing agreements, strategic alliances, and our ability to realize the full potential of our technology in
development. Such additional funds may not become available on acceptable terms, if at all, and there can be no assurance that
any additional funding that we do obtain will be sufficient to meet our needs in the long term. Through September 30, 2016, virtually
all of our financing has been through private placements of common stock, convertible notes and warrants and cash infusions from
the Founder. We intend to continue to fund operations from cash on-hand and through the similar sources of capital previously described
for the foreseeable future. We can give no assurances that any additional capital that we are able to obtain will be sufficient
to meet our needs. We believe that we will continue to incur net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities for the
next year. Based on the resources available to us, we have sufficient cash to operate for one year at the current burn rate with
our CEO s agreement to continue fund our operations. We may need additional financing thereafter. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We do not have any off-balance
sheet arrangements. 

Inflation  

It is our opinion that inflation
has not had a material effect on our operations. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

Our unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the
reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Revenue recognition  

We adopted Accounting Standards
Codification (ASC) subtopic 605-10,   Revenue Recognition   effective for the period ended September 30, 2016.
We recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 605-10,   Revenue Recognition  
( ASC 605-10 ), which requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence
of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is
reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature
of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to
customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. 

ASC 605-10 incorporates
Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 605-25,   Multiple-Element Arrangements   ( ASC 605-25 ).
ASC 605-25 addresses accounting for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or
rights to use assets. The effect of implementing ASC 605-25 on the Company s financial position and results of operations
was not significant. 

Our revenue is generated
by providing analytical and diagnostic information to client physicians to assist the medical professionals in guiding their patients
towards becoming healthier through lifestyle changes and choices. The service revenue is recognized when those services have been
completed or satisfied. 

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  

We account for our stock
options and warrants using the fair value method promulgated by Accounting Standards Codification Subtopic 718-10 Compensation
(ASC 718-10), and 505-50 Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees (ASC 505-50) which address the accounting for transactions in which
an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. Therefore, our results include non-cash compensation expense
as a result of the issuance of stock options and warrants and we expect to record additional non-cash compensation expense in the
future. 

Derivative Liability  

We account for derivatives
in accordance with ASC 815, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other financial instruments or contracts and requires recognition of all derivatives
on the balance sheet at fair value, regardless of hedging relationship designation. Accounting for changes in fair value of the
derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives qualify as hedge relationships and the types of relationships designated
are based on the exposures hedged. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we did not have any derivative instruments that
were designated as hedges. 

At December 31, 2015 through
March 18, 2016, we had the possibility of exceeding the common shares authorized when considering the number of possible shares
that may be issuable to satisfy settlement provisions for all existing instruments that could be settled in shares. Issued shares
never exceeded authorized shares and authorized shares were increased in March 2016. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK  

Not applicable. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

We evaluated the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures to determine whether they are effective in ensuring that we disclose required
information in a timely manner and in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) and the
rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC.  The executive who serves as our President and Chief Financial Officer
has participated in such evaluation.  Management concluded, based on such review, that our disclosure controls and procedures,
as defined by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q.  The ineffectiveness of these disclosure controls is due to the matters described below in  Internal
Control over Financial Reporting.  

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls  

We believe that a control
system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are
met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within
a company have been detected.  Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide a reasonable assurance
of achieving their objectives and our President and Chief Financial Officer has concluded that such controls and procedures are
not effective at the  reasonable assurance  level.  The ineffectiveness of these disclosure controls is due
to the matters described below in  Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  

Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting
is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act. Management assessed the effectiveness of the internal
controls over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016, using the framework set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based upon this assessment, our management concluded
that, as of September 30, 2016, the internal controls over financial reporting were not effective. The reportable conditions and
material weakness relate to a limited segregation of duties at the Company. Segregation of duties within our company is limited
due to the small number of employees that are assigned to positions that involve the processing of financial information. 

Specifically, certain key
financial accounting and reporting personnel had an expansive scope of duties that allowed for the creation, review, approval and
processing of financial data without independent review and authorization for preparation of schedules and resulting consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures. We did not maintain a sufficient depth of personnel with an appropriate level of
accounting knowledge, experience and training in the selection and application of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles commensurate
with financial reporting requirements. 

Accordingly, we place undue
reliance on the finance team at corporate headquarters, specifically the executive who is our President and Chief Financial Officer
along with outside accounting consulting. Accordingly, management has determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material
weakness. This material weakness could result in material misstatements of significant accounts and disclosures that would result
in a material misstatement to our interim or annual consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 

Going forward, management
anticipates that additional staff will be necessary to mitigate these weaknesses, as well as to implement other planned improvements.  Additional
staff will enable us to document and apply transactional and periodic controls procedures, permit a better review and approval
process and improve quality of financial reporting.  However, the potential addition of new staff is contingent on obtaining
additional financing, and there is no assurance that the Company will be able to do so. 

Changes in Internal Control Over financial
Reporting  

During the three months
ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.  

From time to time, the Company
is involved in various litigation matters in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition
of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  

There have been no material
changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
AND USE OF PROCEEDS  

During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, we issued 159,000 shares of common stock to consultants for services rendered in the amount of $40,907. In
connection with the issuance of such shares, we relied on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended.
