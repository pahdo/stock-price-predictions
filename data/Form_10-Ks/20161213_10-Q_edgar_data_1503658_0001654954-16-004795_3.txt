NOTE 1   NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF
PRESENTATION 

HOMEOWNUSA
was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit Company on
December 10, 2009 and established a fiscal year end of January
31. The Company was organized to enter into the home equity
lease/rent to own business. On December 31, 2013, the
Company s sole director and officer and nine other
shareholders sold their interest in the Company to Cloud Biz
International Pte, Ltd ( CloudBiz ), a Singapore
corporation. The total number of shares purchased was 15,730 which
represented a 69% interest in the Company (the
 Transaction ). On July 7, 2014 CloudBiz invested
$37,000 in the Company. For such investment, CloudBiz received an
additional 74 million common shares. The Company is currently
looking into potential business plan opportunities but has not yet
decided on a plan. 

Going concern 

To date
the Company has generated no revenues from its business operations
and has incurred operating losses since inception of
$123,320. The Company requires additional funding to meet its
ongoing obligations and to fund anticipated operating
losses. The ability of the Company to continue as a going
concern is dependent on raising capital to fund its initial
business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations.
Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt as to the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company
intends to continue to fund its business by way of private
placements and advances from related parties as may be required.
These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating
to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts,
or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from
this uncertainty. 

Basis of Presentation 

The
financial statements present the condensed balance sheet, the
condensed statements of operations, the condensed statement of
stockholders  equity and the condensed statement of cash
flows of the Company. These financial statements are presented in
the United States dollars and have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. 

Unaudited Financial Statements 

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for
financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q. They
do not include all information and footnotes required by United
States generally accepted accounting principles for complete
financial statements. However, except as disclosed herein, there
has been no material changes in the information disclosed in the
notes to the financial statements for the year ended January 31,
2014 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The unaudited
financial statements should be read in conjunction with those
financial statements included in the Form 10-K. In the opinion of
Management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair
presentation, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments,
have been made. Operating results for the nine months ended October
31, 2014 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be
expected for the year ending January 31, 2015. 

F-5 

NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES 

Loss per Common Share 

Basic
loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to
the common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of
common stock outstanding during the period. Fully diluted loss per
share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the
denominator is increased to include the number of additional common
shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common
shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were
dilutive. There were no dilutive financial instruments issued or
outstanding for the periods ended October 31, 2014 or October 31,
2013. 

Income Taxes 

The
Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to FASB ASC 740.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
temporary differences between the bases of certain assets and
liabilities for income tax and financial reporting purposes. The
deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified according to the
financial statement classification of the assets and liabilities
generating the differences. 

The
Company maintains a valuation allowance with respect to deferred
tax assets. The Company establishes a valuation allowance based
upon the potential likelihood of realizing the deferred tax asset
and taking into consideration the Company s financial
position and results of operations for the current period. Future
realization of the deferred tax benefit depends on the existence of
sufficient taxable income within the carry-forward period under the
Federal tax laws. 

Changes
in circumstances, such as the Company generating taxable income,
could cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the
related deferred tax asset. Any change in the valuation allowance
will be included in income in the year of the change in
estimate. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The
Company estimates the fair value of financial instruments using the
available market information and valuation methods. Considerable
judgment is required in estimating fair value. Accordingly, the
estimates of fair value may not be indicative of the amounts the
Company could realize in a current market exchange. As of October
31, 2014 the carrying value of accounts payable-trade and accrued
liabilities approximated fair value due to the short-term nature
and maturity of these instruments. 

F-6 

Estimates 

The
financial statements are prepared on the basis of accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates made
by management. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In June
2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting
Standards Codification Update No. 2014-10 for Development stage
entities (Topic 915). The amendments in this updated removed the
definition of a development stage entity from the master glossary
of the Accounting Standards Codification, thereby removing the
financial reporting distinction between development stage entities
and other reporting entities from US GAAP.  In addition, the amendments eliminate the
requirements for development stage entities to (1) present
inception-to-date information in the statements of income, cash
flows, and shareholder equity, (2) label the financial statements
as those of a development stage entity, (3) disclose a description
of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged,
and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer
a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the
development stage . The Company has elected to adopt such
provisions this reporting period. 

On
August 27, 2014, the FASB (the  board ) issued
Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, Disclosure of
Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a
Going Concern, which requires management to assess a
company s ability to continue as a going concern and to
provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances.
Before this new standard, there was minimal guidance in U.S. GAAP
specific to going concern. Under the new standard, disclosures are
required when conditions give rise to substantial doubt about a
company s ability to continue as a going concern within one
year from the financial statement issuance date. The new standard
applies to all companies and is effective for the annual period
ending after December 15, 2016 ,  and all annual and interim periods
thereafter. The Company has adopted such provisions this reporting
period. 

On
February 18, 2015, the Internal Revenue Service issued Notice
2015-17, which offers relief from excise tax under the Affordable
Care Act (ACA) for health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs),
including insurance premium reimbursement arrangements, available
to the employees of small employers and to S-corporation
shareholders. The Company has adopted such provisions this
reporting period. 

F-7 

On
January 5, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
2016-01, Financial Instruments Overall: Recognition and
Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (the
ASU). Changes to the current GAAP model primarily affects the
accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the
fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements
for financial instruments. In addition, the FASB clarified guidance
related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing
deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on
available-for-sale debt securities. The accounting for other
financial instruments, such as loans, investments in debt
securities, and financial liabilities is largely unchanged. The
Company has adopted such provisions this reporting
period. 

On
August 26, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update
2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), a consensus
of the FASB s Emerging Issues Task Force. The new guidance is
intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain
transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. The
Company has adopted such provisions this reporting
period. 

NOTE 3   CAPITAL STOCK 

The
Company s capitalization is 75,000,000 common shares with a
par value of $0.001 per share. No preferred shares have been
authorized or issued. 

On July
7, 2014 CloudBiz invested $37,000 in the Company. For such
investment, CloudBiz will be issued an additional 74 million common
shares. The 74 million common shares were issued below par at a
discount. The discount of $37,000 was recorded as a  discount
on common stock  in equity. 

During
October 2014, the Company issued 20,534 common shares at $0.10 per
share to 30 new shareholders for total proceeds of
$2,053. 

NOTE 4  RECLASSIFICATION 

Reclassifications
of certain prior year balances were made in order to conform with
current year presentation. 

NOTE 5   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

On
December 31, 2013, the Company s sole director and officer
and nine other shareholders sold their interest in the Company to
Cloud Biz International Pte, Ltd ( CloudBiz ), a
Singapore corporation. 

NOTE 6   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

In
February and October of 2016, Cloudbiz International Pte. Ltd, the
majority owner, injected cash of $18,000 and $40, 000 in order to
pay operating expenses. 

On
November 4, 2016 Cloudbiz International Pte. Ltd, the majority
owner, transferred 74,015,730 common shares to Singapore
eDevelopment Ltd.

I tem 2. Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of
Operations 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Certain
matters discussed herein are forward-looking statements. Such
forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q involve
risks and uncertainties, including statements as to: 

1.  

our
future operating results;   

2.  

our
business prospects;  

3.  

any
contractual arrangements and relationships with third
parties;  

4.  

the
dependence of our future success on the general
economy;  

5.  

any
possible financings; and  

6.  

the
adequacy of our cash resources and working
capital.  

These
forward-looking statements can generally be identified as such
because the context of the statement will include words such as we
 believe,   anticipate, 
 expect,   estimate  or words of similar
meaning. Similarly, statements that describe our future plans,
objectives or goals are also forward-looking statements. Such
forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and
uncertainties which are described in close proximity to such
statements and which could cause actual results to differ
materially from those anticipated as of the date of filing of this
Form 10-Q. Shareholders, potential investors and other readers
are urged to consider these factors in evaluating the
forward-looking statements and are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking
statements included herein are only made as of the date of filing
of this Form 10-Q, and we undertake no obligation to publicly
update such forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events
or circumstances. 

This
discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our
plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results may differ
materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking
statements. 

Overview 

The
Company has decided to not pursue its original business plan and is
currently in the process of evaluating new business
opportunities. 

Our
auditor has expressed substantial doubt as to whether we will be
able to continue to operate as a going concern due to the fact that
the Company has incurred net operating losses of $123,320 from
inception though October 31, 2014 and has not yet established on
going source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs
and allow it continue as a going concern. The ability of the
Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company
obtaining the adequate capital to fund operating losses until it
becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate
capital, it could be forced to cease operations. 

1 

Based
on our financial history since inception, our auditor has expressed
substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.
As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, as of
October 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit totaling $123,320.
This raises substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a
going concern. 

Results of Operations 

For the unaudited three-month period ending October 31, 2014 and
2013 

For the
three months ended October 31, 2014 and 2013, we had $0 revenues.
Our total expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2014 were
$29,636 as compared to operating expenses of $8,037 for the three
months ended October 31, 2013, representing an increase of $21,599.
The increase in total expenses was due to increased professional
fees related to the Company s efforts to update its financial
records. For the three months ended October 31, 2014, we incurred a
net loss of $29,636 as compared to a net loss of $8,037 for the
three months ended October 31, 2013. 

For the unaudited nine-month period ending October 31, 2014 and
2013 

For the
nine months ended October 31, 2014 and 2013, we had $0 revenues.
Our total expenses for the nine months ended October 31, 2014 were
$45,636 as compared to operating expenses of $18,160 for the nine
months ended October 31, 2013, representing an increase of $27,476.
The increase in total expenses was due to increased professional
fees related to the Company s efforts to update its financial
records. For the nine months ended October 31, 2014, we incurred a
net loss of $45,636 as compared to a net loss of $18,160 for the
nine months ended October 31, 2013. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of
October 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $6,418, total
assets of $6,418. We anticipate that our current cash and cash
equivalents and cash generated from operations, if any, will be
insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the
next 12 months. We will require additional funds prior to such time
and the Company will seek to obtain these funds by selling
additional capital through private equity placements, debt or other
sources of financing. If we are unable to obtain sufficient
additional financing, we may be required to reduce the scope of our
planned operations, which could harm our business, financial
condition and operating results. Additional funding to meet our
requirements may not be available on favorable terms, if at
all. 

2 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have
no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably
likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources that are material to stockholders. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk  

We are
a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the
Security Act 0f 1934 and are not required to provide the
information required under this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible
for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures
for the Company. 

(a)
 Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures  

Based
on the evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange
Act ) are not effective to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission s ( SECs ) rules and forms and to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

(b)
 Changes in the
Company s Internal Controls Over Financial
Reporting  

Other
than described above, there have been no changes in the
Company s internal control over financial reporting during
the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially
affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company s internal control over financial reporting.
