NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)    

1. 
    Description of Business and Accounting Policies 
     Description of Business     Cincinnati Bell Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries ("Cincinnati Bell", "we", "our", "us" or the "Company") provides diversified telecommunications and technology services.  The Company generates a large portion of its revenue by serving customers in the Greater Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio areas.  An economic downturn or natural disaster occurring in this, or a portion of this, limited operating territory could have a disproportionate effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows compared to similar companies of a national scope and similar companies operating in different geographic areas.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we operate our business through the following segments: Entertainment and Communications and IT Services and Hardware. 
  The company has   3,400   employees as of   September 30, 2016  , and approximately   30%   of its employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Communications Workers of America ( CWA ) that will be in effect through May 12, 2018. 
  The Company has receivables with   one   large customer, General Electric Company ("GE"), that makes up   23%   and   22%   of the outstanding accounts receivable balance at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively.  GE represented   12%   of consolidated revenue for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015.    
    
  Basis of Presentation     The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations, other comprehensive income, financial position and cash flows for each period presented. 
  The adjustments referred to above are of a normal and recurring nature.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to SEC rules and regulations for interim reporting. 
  The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   December 31, 2015   was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP.  These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Operating results for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year or any other interim period. 
  On October 4, 2016, the Company filed an amendment to its Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to affect a one-for-five reverse split of its issued common stock (the  Reverse Split ) which had the effect of reducing the number of issued shares of common stock from   210,275,005   to   42,055,001  , effective as of 11:59 pm on October 4, 2016. Any fractional shares of common stock resulting from the Reverse Split were settled in cash equal to the fraction of a share to which the holder was entitled. As a result of the Reverse Split, the Company reduced total par value from common stock by    $1.7 million   and increased the additional paid-in capital by the same amount for the reporting periods.   
  All shares of common stock, stock options, the conversion rate of preferred stock and per share information presented in the consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split on a retroactive basis for all periods presented and all share information is rounded down to the nearest whole share after reflecting the Reverse Split. 
  The closing of our wireless operations in March 2015 represented a strategic shift in our business. Therefore, certain wireless assets, liabilities and results of operations are reported as discontinued operations in our financial statements.  See Note 9 for all required disclosures. 
  Use of Estimates     Preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to various regulatory and tax proceedings, lawsuits, claims and other matters.  The Company believes adequate provision has been made for all such asserted and unasserted claims in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  Such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable with assurance.

Restructuring Liability     As of   September 30, 2016  , restructuring liabilities have been established for lease abandonments and other charges.  As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015,   $0.1 million   and   $0.9 million  , respectively, of the restructuring liabilities were included in  Other current liabilities,  in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015,   $0.1 million   and   $0.2 million  , respectively were included in  Other noncurrent liabilities  in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.   
  Income Taxes     The Company s income tax provision for interim periods is determined through the use of an estimated annual effective tax rate applied to year-to-date ordinary income, as well as the tax effects associated with discrete items. The Company expects its effective rate to exceed statutory rates primarily due to non-deductible expenses. 
  In the third quarter of 2016, the Company reclassed   $12.3 million   of Alternative Minimum Tax ("AMT") refundable tax credits from non-current "Deferred income taxes, net" to "Receivables" as these credits are now expected to be utilized in the next twelve months.  The accelerated utilization of the AMT refundable tax credits is due to an election under new tax legislation that will be made by the Company on the 2016 tax return.  
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards     In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flow - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which amends ASC 230 to add or clarify guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows.  The FASB issued the ASU with the intent of reducing diversity in practice.  The new standard is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on the Company s consolidated statement of cash flows and plans to adopt the standard effective January 1, 2018.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation, which simplifies various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements.  The new standard is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on the Company s consolidated financial statements and plans to adopt the standard effective January 1, 2017.  
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which represents a wholesale change to lease accounting.  The standard introduces a lessee model that brings most leases on the balance sheet as well as aligning certain underlying principles of the new lessor model with those in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 606.  The new standard is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and lessees and lessors are required to use a modified retrospective transition method for existing leases.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  The FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, in January 2016, which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments.  The amended guidance requires entities to carry all investments in equity securities at fair value through net income unless the entity has elected the practicability exception to fair value measurement.  This standard will be effective for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018 and will require a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings on this date.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in the financial statements.  Specifically, this amendment requires that costs associated with the issuance of debt be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability.  The Company retrospectively adopted the amended standard effective January 1, 2016.  The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015 has been restated to reflect this change in accounting principle.  Note issuance costs of   $8.0 million   were reclassed from  Other noncurrent assets  to  Long-term debt, less current portion.   Note 3 has been updated to reflect the adjustment.  On the effective date of ASU 2015-03, the Company made a one-time policy election to record costs incurred in connection with obtaining revolving credit agreements as an asset and to amortize these costs ratably over the term of the agreement.  This accounting treatment is consistent with how deferred financing costs were accounted for prior to adoption of ASU 2015-03.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The standard s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This standard also includes expanded disclosure requirements that result in an entity providing users of financial statements with comprehensive information about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity s contracts with customers. In August 2015, ASU 2015-14 was issued deferring the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with an optional early application date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company has elected to adopt the standard in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018.  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, an update to ASU 2014-09, clarifying the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the standard for the IT Services and Hardware segment that is a reseller of Telecom and IT hardware.  Under the current guidance, these equipment revenues are generally recorded on a gross basis.  The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of adoption of ASU 2014-09, as well as all subsequent amendments to this standard, on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the year had, or is expected to have, a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

2.    Earnings Per Common Share 
  Basic earnings per common share ( EPS ) is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that would occur upon the issuance of common shares for awards under stock-based compensation plans, the exercise of warrants or the conversion of preferred stock, but only to the extent that they are considered dilutive. 
  The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted EPS after consideration of the 1-for-5 reverse stock split that became effective 11:59 pm as of October 4, 2016: 

For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , awards under the Company's stock-based compensation plans for common shares of   0.2 million   and   0.4 million  , respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS as the inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , awards under the Company's stock-based compensation plans for common shares of   0.7 million   were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS as the inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.  For all periods presented, preferred stock convertible into   0.9 million   common shares was excluded as it was anti-dilutive.

3.    Debt 
  The Company s debt consists of the following: 

Corporate Credit Agreement 
  In the second quarter of 2016, the Company amended its Corporate Credit Agreement originally dated as of November 20, 2012.  This amendment reduces the aggregate revolving commitments available under the revolving credit facility to   $150.0 million  , modifies certain financial covenants and related definitions governing leverage ratios and capital expenditures, and extends the maturity date of the revolving credit facility to January 2020.  As a result of the amendment, the Company recorded a   $1.7 million   loss on extinguishment of debt in the second quarter of 2016.  There were   no   outstanding borrowings on the Corporate Credit Agreement's revolving credit facility, leaving   $150.0 million   available for borrowings as of   September 30, 2016  .   
  Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $23.5 million   of borrowings and   $6.3 million   of letters of credit outstanding under the accounts receivable securitization facility ("Receivables Facility"), leaving   $90.2 million   remaining availability on the total borrowing capacity of   $120.0 million  .  In the second quarter of 2016, the Company executed an amendment of its Receivables Facility, which replaced, amended and added certain provisions and definitions to increase the credit availability, renew the facility, which is subject to renewal every 364 days, until May 26, 2017, and extend the facility's termination date to May 27, 2019.  In the event the Receivables Facility is not renewed, the Company has the ability to refinance any outstanding borrowings with borrowings under the Corporate Credit Agreement.  Under the terms of the Receivables Facility, the Company could obtain up to   $120.0 million   depending on the quantity and quality of accounts receivable.  Under this agreement, certain subsidiaries, or originators, sell their respective trade receivables on a continuous basis to Cincinnati Bell Funding LLC ( CBF ).  Although CBF is a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary of the Company, CBF is legally separate from the Company and each of the Company s other subsidiaries.  Upon and after the sale or contribution of the accounts receivable to CBF, such accounts receivable are legally assets of CBF and, as such, are not available to creditors of the Company's other subsidiaries or the Company.

7% Senior Notes due 2024 
  In the third quarter of 2016, the Company issued in a private offering   $425.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   7%   senior notes due 2024 ("2024 Notes") at par.  The 2024 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company, which rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured senior debt of the Company.  The 2024 Notes will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured indebtedness of the Company to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.  The 2024 Notes are guaranteed on a joint and several basis by certain of the Company s existing and future domestic subsidiaries.  Each such guarantee is a senior unsecured obligation of the applicable guarantor, ranking equally with all existing and future unsecured senior debt of such guarantor and effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured indebtedness of such guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing that indebtedness.  The 2024 Notes are structurally subordinated to all liabilities (including trade payables) of each subsidiary of the Company that does not guarantee the 2024 Notes.  
  The 2024 Notes bear interest at a rate of   7%   per annum, payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2017, to persons who are registered holders of the 2024 Notes on the immediately preceding January 1 and July 1, respectively. 
  The 2024 Notes will mature on July 15, 2024.  However, prior to September 15, 2019, the Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2024 Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2024 Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, plus a  make-whole  premium.  On or after September 15, 2019, the Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2024 Notes at any time at declining redemption prices equal to (i)   105.250%   beginning on September 15, 2019, (ii)   103.500%   beginning on September 15, 2020, (iii)   101.750%   beginning on September 15, 2021 and (iv)   100.000%   beginning on September 15, 2022 and thereafter, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the applicable redemption date.  In addition, before September 15, 2019, and subject to certain conditions, the Company may, at its option, redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of 2024 Notes with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings at 107.000% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption; provided that (i) at least 60% of the aggregate principal amount of 2024 Notes remains outstanding and (ii) the redemption occurs within 180 days of the closing of any such equity offering. 
  The indenture governing the 2024 Notes contains covenants including but not limited to the following: limitations on dividends to shareowners and other restricted payments; dividend and other payment restrictions affecting the Company s subsidiaries such that the subsidiaries are generally not permitted to enter into an agreement that would limit their ability to make dividend payments to the parent; issuance of indebtedness; asset dispositions; transactions with affiliates; liens; investments; issuances and sales of capital stock of subsidiaries; and redemption of debt that is junior in right of payment. The indenture governing the 2024 Notes provides for customary events of default, including a cross-default provision for both nonpayment at final maturity or acceleration due to a default of any other existing debt instrument that equals or exceeds   $35 million  . 
  Debt Repayments 
  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company redeemed   $29.8 million   of its outstanding 6.30% unsecured senior notes due 2028 (the "Cincinnati Bell Telephone Notes") at an average redemption price of   91.130%   which resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of   $2.4 million  .   
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company repaid   $81.4 million   of its outstanding 8    3   /   8    % Senior Notes due 2020 ("2020 Notes") at an average redemption price of   104.184%   which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of   $3.7 million  .  Additionally, the Company redeemed   $5.0 million   of its Cincinnati Bell Telephone Notes at a redemption price of   94.875%   which resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of   $0.2 million   in the second quarter of 2016. 
  The 2024 Notes net proceeds of   $418.5 million  , after fees and expenses, were used to purchase   $312.5 million   aggregate principal amount of its 2020 Notes tendered in connection with an offer to purchase for cash any and all of the 2020 Notes at a redemption price of   103.250%  , including payment of accrued and unpaid interest, which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of   $11.5 million   in the third quarter of 2016.  Additionally, the Company notified its trustee of its election to redeem the   $84.6 million   remaining outstanding 2020 Notes at a redemption rate of   102.792%  , including payment of accrued and unpaid interest thereon, on October 24, 2016.  As a result, a loss on extinguishment of debt totaling approximately   $3 million   will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016.  Simultaneous with the delivery of such notice, the Company deposited   $90.7 million   of funds in a restricted cash account with the trustee.

Also during the third quarter of 2016, the Company redeemed   $6.0 million   of its Cincinnati Bell Telephone Notes at a redemption price of   95.500%   which resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of   $0.2 million  .  Additionally, the Company repaid   $4.0 million   of its 7    1   /   4    % Senior Notes due 2023 at a redemption price of   100.750%   which resulted in a   $0.1 million   loss on extinguishment of debt. 
   
  4.    Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements 
  The carrying values of the Company's financial instruments approximate the estimated fair values as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , except for the Company's investment in CyrusOne and long-term debt.  The carrying and fair values of these financial instruments are as follows:    

The fair value of our investment in CyrusOne was based on the closing market price of CyrusOne's common stock on   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  This fair value measurement is considered Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  The fair value of our long-term debt was based on closing or estimated market prices of the Company s debt at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , which is considered Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

5.    Pension and Postretirement Plans 
  The Company sponsors three noncontributory defined benefit plans and a postretirement health and life insurance plan.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, approximately   10%   of the costs were capitalized as a component of property, plant and equipment related to construction of our copper and fiber networks.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, approximately   12%   and   10%  , respectively, of the costs were capitalized as a component of property, plant and equipment related to construction of our copper and fiber networks.  During the second quarter of 2015, the bargained pension plan was amended to eliminate all future pension credits and transition benefits.  As a result, we recognized a curtailment loss of   $0.3 million   in the three months ended June 30, 2015 and remeasured the associated pension obligation.  This remeasurement resulted in a decrease of our pension liability of   $1.7 million  . 
  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , pension and postretirement benefit costs were as follows: 

Amortizations of prior service cost (benefit) and actuarial loss represent reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income.   
  Based on current assumptions, management believes that the Company will not make any contributions to the qualified pension plan in 2016.  Contributions to non-qualified pension plans in 2016 are expected to be approximately   $2 million  .  The Company expects to make cash payments of approximately   $10 million   related to its postretirement health plans in 2016. 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , contributions to the non-qualified pension plans were   $1.9 million   and contributions to the postretirement plan were   $5.7 million  .

6.    Stock-Based and Other Compensation Plans 
  The Company grants stock options, stock appreciation rights ( SARs ), long-term incentive plan performance-based awards, and time-based restricted shares, some of which are cash-settled awards with the final payment indexed to the percentage change in the Company s stock price from the date of grant. 
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of   $1.1 million   and   $6.5 million  , respectively, inclusive of   $0.4 million   of mark-to-market gain and   $1.0 million   of mark-to-market expense on awards indexed to the Company's stock price.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of   $0.1 million   and   $3.4 million  , respectively, inclusive of   $1.1 million   and   $0.2 million   of mark-to-market gains on awards indexed to the Company's stock price.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $10.9 million   of unrecognized compensation expense related to these awards.  The remaining compensation expense for the stock options, SARs and restricted awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately two years, and the remaining expense for long-term incentive plan performance-based awards will be recognized within approximately one year. 
  The Company also has deferred compensation plans for its Board of Directors and certain executives.  Under these plans, participants can elect to invest their deferrals in the Company s common stock.  In the fourth quarter of 2015, the executive deferred compensation plan was terminated.  All amounts due under the executive deferred compensation plan will be distributed to plan participants during 2016.  At both   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the number of common shares deferred under these plans was   0.1 million  .  As these awards can be settled in cash, the Company records compensation costs each period based on the change in the Company s stock price.  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized a benefit of   $0.2 million   and expense of   $0.1 million  , respectively, related to these awards.  For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized a benefit of   $0.2 million   related to these awards.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized nominal expense.   

7.    Shareowners' Deficit 
  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, the changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss by component were as follows: 

(a)  These reclassifications are included in the components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs (see Note 5 for additional details).  The components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs are reported within "Cost of services," "Cost of products sold," and "Selling, general and administrative" expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Share Repurchases 
  In 2010, the Board of Directors approved a plan for the repurchase of the Company's outstanding common stock in an amount up to   $150.0 million  .  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company repurchased and retired approximately   0.2 million   shares of its common stock for   $4.6 million  .

8.    Investment in CyrusOne 
  On January 24, 2013, we completed the initial public offering ("IPO") of CyrusOne Inc. ("CyrusOne"), which owns and operates our former Data Center Colocation business.  CyrusOne conducts its data center business through CyrusOne LP, an operating partnership.  Effective with the IPO, our   69%   ownership was held in the form of   1.9 million   shares of unregistered common stock of CyrusOne Inc. and   42.6 million   economically equivalent partnership units in its underlying operating entity, CyrusOne LP.  Therefore, effective January 24, 2013, we no longer included the accounts of CyrusOne in our consolidated financial statements and accounted for our ownership as an equity method investment as we no longer controlled the operations but maintained significant influence.  From the date of the IPO, we recognized our proportionate share of CyrusOne's net income or loss as non-operating income or expense in our statement of operations through December 31, 2015.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, our equity method share of CyrusOne's net loss was   $0.8 million   and   $5.2 million  , respectively.  
  Effective December 31, 2015, we exchanged our remaining   6.3 million   operating partnership units in CyrusOne LP for an equal number of newly issued shares of common stock of CyrusOne Inc.  As a result, we owned   6.9 million   shares of CyrusOne's common shares and no longer had significant influence over the entity.  Therefore, as of December 31, 2015, our ownership in CyrusOne is accounted for as a cost method investment, and we no longer record our pro-rata share of CyrusOne's financial results in our statement of operations.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company received cash dividends from CyrusOne totaling   $6.2 million   and   $19.5 million  , respectively.  Dividends from CyrusOne were recognized as a reduction of our investment.  
  In the second quarter of 2016, we sold   3.1 million   shares of CyrusOne Inc. common stock for net proceeds totaling   $142.5 million   that resulted in a gain of   $118.6 million  .  In the second quarter of 2015, we sold   14.3 million   operating partnership units for net proceeds of   $426.0 million   that resulted in a gain of   $295.2 million  .   
  In the third quarter of 2016, we sold   0.8 million   shares of CyrusOne Inc. common stock for net proceeds totaling   $38.7 million   that resulted in a gain of   $33.3 million  .  In the third quarter of 2015, we sold   6.0 million   operating partnership units of CyrusOne LP to CyrusOne, Inc. for proceeds of   $170.3 million   that resulted in a gain of   $117.7 million  .  As of September 30, 2016, we held   3.0 million   shares of CyrusOne Inc. common stock valued at   $144.3 million  .  
  Subsequent to the end of the third quarter of 2016, we sold   0.2 million   shares of CyrusOne Inc. common stock for net proceeds totaling approximately   $8 million   that resulted in a gain of approximately   $7 million  . 
  Transactions with CyrusOne 
  Revenues   - The Company records revenue from CyrusOne under contractual service arrangements which include, among others, providing services such as fiber transport, network support, service calls, monitoring and management, storage and back-up, and IT systems support.  
  Operating Expenses -   We lease data center and office space from CyrusOne at certain locations in the Cincinnati area under operating leases and are also billed for other services provided by CyrusOne under contractual service arrangements.  In the normal course of business, the Company also provides certain administrative services to CyrusOne which are billed based on agreed-upon rates.  
  Revenues and operating costs and expenses from transactions with CyrusOne were as follows:

9.    Discontinued Operations 
  Cincinnati Bell Wireless LLC ("CBW"), our former Wireless segment,  provided digital wireless voice and data communications services to customers in the Company s licensed service territory, which included Greater Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio, and areas of northern Kentucky and southeastern Indiana.  The Company s customers were also able to place and receive wireless calls nationally and internationally due to roaming agreements the Company had with other carriers.  
  In the second quarter of 2014, we entered into agreements to sell our wireless spectrum licenses and certain other assets related to our wireless business, including leases to certain wireless towers and related equipment and other assets.  The agreement to sell our spectrum licenses closed on September 30, 2014 for cash proceeds of   $194.4 million  .  Prior to this date, the Company's digital wireless network utilized 50 MHz of licensed spectrum in the Cincinnati area and 40 MHz of licensed spectrum in the Dayton area, which had a carrying value of   $88.2 million  .  Simultaneous with the close of the spectrum sale, the Company entered into a separate agreement to use certain wireless spectrum licenses for $8.00 until we no longer provided wireless service.  We ceased providing wireless service effective March 31, 2015.  The fair value of the lease, which is considered a Level 3 measurement based on other comparable transactions, totaled   $6.4 million   and was recorded as a prepaid expense and amortized over a six month period ending March 31, 2015. 
  As of March 31, 2015, there were no subscribers remaining on the network and we no longer required the use of the spectrum being leased.  Therefore, the   $112.6 million   gain on the sale of the wireless spectrum licenses, which had been previously deferred, was recognized in Income from discontinued operations, net of tax in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2015.  On April 1, 2015, we transferred certain other assets related to our wireless business, including leases to certain wireless towers and related equipment and other assets, which resulted in a gain of   $15.9 million   in the second quarter of 2015.   
    
  Wireless financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were nominal.  Wireless financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 reported as Income from discontinued operations, net of tax on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations are as follows: 

Wireless liabilities presented as discontinued operations as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows:

  Introduction 
  This Management s Discussion and Analysis section provides an overview of Cincinnati Bell Inc.'s financial condition as of   September 30, 2016  , and the results of operations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  This discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes, as well as the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  Results for interim periods may not be indicative of results for the full year or any other interim period. 

Executive Summary 
    
  Segment results described in the Executive Summary and Consolidated Results of Operations sections are net of intercompany eliminations.   
  Cincinnati Bell Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries ("Cincinnati Bell", "we", "our", "us" or the "Company") provides integrated communications and IT solutions that keep residential and business customers connected with each other and with the world. Through its Entertainment and Communications segment, the Company provides high speed data, video, and voice solutions to consumers and businesses over an expanding fiber network and a legacy copper network. In addition, business customers across the United States rely on Cincinnati Bell Technology Solutions Inc. ("CBTS"), a wholly-owned subsidiary, reported as the IT Services and Hardware segment, for the sale and service of efficient, end-to-end communications and IT hardware and solutions.  
  Consolidated revenue totaling   $312.4 million   and   $900.5 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, increased compared to the prior year primarily due to growth of our strategic products.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, revenue from our strategic products totaled $162.8 million and $472.0 million, respectively, up 18% and 20% from the prior year comparable period.  These increases were partially offset by declining legacy product sales. 
  Operating income was   $25.5 million   and   $82.5 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, down from the prior year due in large part to increased depreciation expense associated with the impact of accelerating the construction of our fiber network and reducing the estimated useful life of certain set-top boxes and the related software as we upgrade customers to new technology.  We also reduced the estimated useful life of our copper assets in the fourth quarter of 2015.  Net income totaled   $18.8 million   and   $103.4 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, including the $33.3 million gain recognized on the sale of   0.8 million   CyrusOne Inc. common shares in the three months ended September 30, 2016.  Proceeds from year to date sales of CyrusOne Inc. common shares totaling $181.2 million, resulting in a gain of $151.9 million, were primarily used to repay $96.4 million of debt and repurchase 0.2 million of the Company's common shares.

In the third quarter of 2016, the Company issued   $425.0 million   aggregate principal amount of 7% senior notes due 2024 ("2024 Notes") at par.  The net proceeds of   $418.5 million  , after fees and expenses, were used to redeem   $312.5 million   aggregate principal amount of its 8    3   /   8    % Senior Notes due 2020 ("2020 Notes") in the third quarter of 2016.  Additionally, the Company notified its trustee of its election to redeem all of the remaining outstanding 2020 Notes at a redemption rate of 102.792%, including payment of accrued and unpaid interest thereon, on October 24, 2016.

Consolidated Results of Operations  
  Revenue 

Entertainment and Communications revenue increased as the growth in Fioptics and other strategic services offset the combined impact of legacy declines and no longer providing backhaul services to our discontinued wireless operations effective March 31, 2015.  Fioptics revenue totaled $65.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $185.5 million for the nine months then ended, up 32% and 35%, respectively, from both prior year comparable periods.  IT Services and Hardware increased primarily due to demand for cloud services.  

Product revenue is primarily driven by the volume of Telecom and IT hardware sales reflecting the cyclical fluctuation in capital spending by our enterprise customers in our IT Services and Hardware segment. In 2016, the Entertainment and Communications segment is no longer selling Verizon wireless handsets at our retail locations. The sale of Verizon handsets generated revenue of $0.3 million and $2.9 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 
  Operating Costs 

Cost of services increased due to growth in our strategic products. Entertainment and Communications costs also increased due to programming costs associated with our growing Fioptics video subscriber base and higher programming rates. 

Cost of products are primarily impacted by changes in Telecom and IT hardware sales. Entertainment and Communications cost of products was down as a result of no longer selling Verizon handsets at our retail locations.

Entertainment and Communications SG A costs were down primarily due to lower payroll related costs partially offset by increased advertising costs to support the growth of Fioptics.  Entertainment and Communications SG A costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 also included one-time additional pension charges totaling $3.8 million incurred in the second quarter.  IT Services and Hardware SG A costs were up for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily related to increased payroll and headcount-related costs to support the growth for our strategic products.  Corporate SG A costs increased from a year ago driven largely by additional stock-based compensation expense from plans indexed to changes in our stock price. 

The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to an increase in Entertainment and Communications depreciation as a result of expanding our fiber-based network, reducing the estimated useful life of certain set-top boxes and the related software as we upgrade customers to new technology.  We also reduced the estimated useful life of our copper assets in the fourth quarter of 2015.  

Restructuring charges incurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were primarily related to employee severance, project costs associated with the on-going process of integrating each segment's business markets team and lease abandonments.  Severance charges were also incurred as a result of discontinuing our cyber-security product offering. 
    
  In the third quarter of 2016, we recognized loss on disposal of assets no longer in use as a result of damage.  In the first quarter of 2015, we recognized a $1.4 million loss on the sale or disposal of our cyber-security assets as the acquiring company was in the process of securing financing and recovery of the related note was not probable. This process was completed in the third quarter of 2015 and the loss was reversed. In the second quarter of 2015, the Entertainment and Communications segment recognized a $0.3 million loss on disposal of software assets no longer in use.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company amended the bargained pension plan to eliminate all future pension service credits effective May 1, 2015. As a result, the Company remeasured its projected benefit obligation for this plan and recognized a curtailment loss of $0.3 million in the second quarter or 2015. 
  Corporate incurred transaction costs of   $0.8 million   in the third quarter of 2015 as we explored opportunities to increase the scale of our IT Services and Hardware Segment.  

Interest expense decreased primarily due to the Company using proceeds from the sale of a portion of its CyrusOne investment for debt repayments totaling $531.7 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.   
  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company repaid $29.8 million of its outstanding Cincinnati Bell Telephone Notes due 2028 resulting in a $2.4 million gain on extinguishment of debt.  In the second quarter of 2016, the Company repaid   $81.4 million   of its outstanding 2020 Notes resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of   $3.7 million  .  Additionally, the Company redeemed   $5.0 million   of its Cincinnati Bell Telephone Notes which resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of   $0.2 million   in the second quarter of 2016.  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company amended its Corporate Credit Agreement originally dated November 20, 2012 which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.7 million.  In the third quarter of 2016, the Company issued $425.0 million of 7% Senior Notes due 2024 at par.  The net proceeds were used to purchase   $312.5 million   aggregate principal amount of its 2020 Notes resulting in an   $11.5 million   loss on extinguishment of debt.  Also in the third quarter of 2016, the Company redeemed   $6.0 million   of its Cincinnati Bell Telephone Notes resulting in a gain on extinguishment of debt of   $0.2 million   and repaid   $4.0 million   of its 7    1   /   4    % Senior Notes due 2023 resulting in a $0.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt. 
  In the third quarter of 2015, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt totaling   $7.8 million   related to the redemption of $137.6 million of its outstanding 2020 Notes.  In the second quarter of 2015, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt totaling $10.4 million related to the redemption of the remaining balance outstanding of its  8  % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 as well as $3.1 million related to the redemption of  $45.1 million of its outstanding 2020 Notes.  
  In the third quarter of 2016, the sale of   0.8 million   shares of Cyrus One Inc. common stock for net proceeds totaling   $38.7 million   resulted in a gain of   $33.3 million  .  In the second quarter of 2016, the sale of   3.1 million   shares of CyrusOne Inc. common stock for net proceeds totaling $142.5 million resulted in a gain of $118.6 million.  During the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company recognized a   $117.7 million   gain on the sale of   6.0 million   CyrusOne LP partnership units.  In the second quarter of 2015, the Company recognized a $295.2 million gain on the sale of 14.3 million CyrusOne LP partnership units.  
  Other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, is primarily related to the release of an asset retirement obligation related to certain tower leases that was no longer required as the decommissioning of the towers was completed.  Effective December 31, 2015, we exchanged our remaining 6.3 million operating partnership units in CyrusOne LP for an equal number of newly issued shares of common stock of CyrusOne Inc. As a result, at December 31, 2015, we owned approximately 9.5% of CyrusOne's common shares and no longer had significant influence over the entity. Therefore, as of December 31, 2015, our ownership in CyrusOne is accounted for as a cost method investment.  Other (income) expense, net, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, includes the Company's share of CyrusOne's net loss recorded under the equity method of accounting totaling $0.8 million and $5.2 million, respectively.

Income tax expense decreased year over year primarily due to lower income before tax. The Company expects to use federal and state net operating loss carryforwards to substantially defray payment of federal and state tax liabilities in 2016.  
  Effective March 31, 2015, we discontinued operating our wireless business as there were no subscribers remaining on the network. As a result, we no longer required the use of the spectrum being leased. Therefore, the $112.6 million gain on sale of wireless spectrum licenses, which had previously been deferred, was recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2015.  In the second quarter of 2015, we transferred certain other assets related to our wireless business to the purchaser, including leases to certain wireless towers and related equipment and other assets, which resulted in a gain of $15.9 million in the second quarter of 2015.  The gain in both periods more than offset operating losses as we continued to incur costs during the wind down of the wireless business.

  Consumer 
  Consumer market revenue has increased from the comparable periods in the previous year due to Fioptics growth offsetting legacy access line, DSL subscriber and long-distance line loss.  Our Fioptics internet subscriber base increased 29% and average revenue per user ("ARPU") was up 9% compared to the third quarter of 2015.  Fioptics video subscribers as of the end of the third quarter of 2016 increased 24% compared to the same period a year ago, in addition to a 4% increase in ARPU.  
  The Company continues to lose access and long distance lines as a result of, among other factors, customers electing to solely use wireless service in lieu of traditional local wireline service.  The Company also continues to experience DSL subscriber loss as a result of customers migrating to Fioptics or an alternative internet provider, particularly in areas that have not been upgraded to Fioptics.  
  Integration revenue decreased in 2016 primarily due to no longer selling Verizon handsets at our retail locations effective January 31, 2016.  The sale of Verizon handsets generated revenue of $2.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
  Business 
  Business market revenue has remained consistent year-over-year as the growth in strategic revenue continues to partially offset declines realized by our legacy and integration products and services.  Data revenue from our business customers has increased as customers migrate from our legacy product offerings to higher bandwidth fiber solutions. Voice revenue declined $0.5 million and $2.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as the growth in VoIP lines continues to partially mitigate legacy voice and long distance lines loss. 
  Carrier 
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, data revenue declined by $2.2 million compared to the prior year comparable period as carriers migrate from legacy product offerings to higher bandwidth fiber solutions.  Data revenue declined for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of the same trends that impacted the quarter as well as a $2.5 million decline due to no longer providing backhaul services to our discontinued wireless operations effective March 31, 2015.  Voice revenue continues to decrease in 2016 in part due to Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") mandated reductions of terminating switched access rates.   
  Operating costs and expenses 
  Cost of services and products has increased primarily due to higher programming costs of $4.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $13.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods during 2015.  These increases are the result of the growing number of Fioptics video subscribers combined with higher programming rates.  Payroll related costs also increased primarily driven by increased headcount and overtime to support the growth of our fiber-based network.  Additionally, network costs increased in both comparative periods of 2016 as we continue to accelerate our fiber investment.  These increased costs were partially offset by reduced costs associated with selling Verizon handsets that totaled $2.6 million in the first three quarters of 2015.  
  SG A expenses decreased in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year primarily due to lower payroll related charges, partially offset by increased advertising costs.  SG A expenses decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of the same trends that impacted the quarter as well as $3.8 million additional pension related charges incurred in the second quarter of 2015.  
  Depreciation and amortization expenses for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   increased compared to the prior year primarily due to assets placed in service in connection with the expansion of our fiber network, reducing the estimated useful life of certain set-top boxes and the related software as we upgrade customers to new technology.  We also reduced the useful life of our copper assets in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Entertainment and Communications, continued 
  Other costs of $0.8 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are attributable to assets disposed in the third quarter that are no longer in use as a result of damage.  Other costs for nine months ended September 30, 2015 are comprised of restructuring charges primarily related to employee severance as we identified opportunities to integrate the business markets within our Entertainment and Communications and IT Services   Hardware segments.  Loss on disposal of assets related to an abandoned software project totaled $0.3 million in the second quarter of 2015 and a curtailment loss of $0.3 million was due to a remeasurement of the Company's projected benefit obligation following an amendment to the bargained pension plan in the second quarter of 2015. 
  Capital Expenditures 

Capital expenditures are incurred to expand our Fioptics product suite, upgrade and increase capacity for our networks, and to enhance our fiber and copper networks. In the third quarter of 2016, we passed an additional 30,800 addresses with Fioptics.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company is able to provide its Fioptics services to 509,500 residential and business addresses, or approximately 64% of our operating territory.  Fioptics installation costs increased in 2016 due to increased Fioptics internet and video activations combined with upgrading set-top boxes and wireless modems.  Other Fioptics capital expenditures have decreased from prior year due to core network upgrades during 2015. 
  Other strategic capital expenditures are for success-based fiber builds and related equipment for business and carrier projects in order to provide ethernet services.

  Revenue 
  The following IT Services and Hardware services and products have either been classified as strategic or integration: 

Unified communications revenue was up compared to the prior year due to the increase in voice profiles utilized.  Cloud services increased due to the increase in virtual machines monitored, primarily for one of our largest customers, combined with a new end user support project.  
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Management and Monitoring revenue was up compared to the prior year due to the increase in devices monitored.  Professional services revenue also increased as billable headcount and utilization more than offset the decline in one-time managed service build projects. 
  Integration revenue is primarily driven by the volume of Telecom and IT hardware sales reflecting the cyclical fluctuation in capital spending by our enterprise customers, which may be influenced by many factors, including the timing of customers' capital spend, the size of their capital budgets, general economic conditions and the continued migration of customers to cloud based solutions. 
  Costs and Expenses 
  Cost of services and products is primarily impacted by changes in Telecom and IT hardware sales and headcount-related costs.      For the three and nine months ended September 30,   2016  , the cost to support the growth of our strategic products increased $1.6 million and $8.0 million, respectively, primarily related to payroll costs.  Cost of Telecom and IT hardware sales increased $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, costs of Telecom and IT hardware sales decreased $10.7 million. 
  Increased selling, general and administrative costs during 2016 are primarily related to increased payroll and headcount related costs to support the growth for our strategic products. 
  Other expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 included a $0.3 million loss on disposal of assets.  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , other expenses included restructuring charges which consisted of employee severance and project related costs of $0.8 million related to the integration of each segment's business markets.  Lease abandonment charges totaling $0.3 million were related to office space in Canada that is no longer in use.  Restructuring associated with discontinuing our advanced cyber-security product offering in the first quarter of 2015 totaled $1.7 million.  In the first quarter of 2015, we recognized a $1.4 million loss on the sale or disposal of our cyber-security assets as the acquiring company was in the process of securing financing and recovery of the related note was not probable. This process was completed in the third quarter of 2015 and the loss was reversed.

Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $1,224.3 million   of outstanding indebtedness and an accumulated deficit of   $2,730.8 million  .  A significant amount of the Company's indebtedness and accumulated deficit resulted from the purchase and operation of a national broadband business, which was sold in 2003. 
  The Company s primary source of cash is generated by operations.  The Company generated   $141.7 million   and   $94.7 million   of cash flows from operations during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  In the second quarter of 2016, the Company amended its Corporate Credit Agreement originally dated as of November 20, 2012.  This amendment reduces the aggregate revolving commitments available under the revolving credit facility to $150.0 million, modifies certain financial covenants and related definitions governing leverage ratios and capital expenditures, and extends the maturity date of the revolving credit facility to January 2020.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $248.7 million   of short-term liquidity, comprised of   $8.5 million   of cash and cash equivalents,   $150.0 million   of undrawn capacity on our Corporate Credit Agreement and   $90.2 million   available under the Receivables Facility.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $23.5 million   of borrowings and   $6.3 million   of letters of credit outstanding under the Receivables Facility on a borrowing capacity of   $120.0 million  .  In the second quarter of 2016, the Company executed an amendment of its Receivables Facility, which replaced, amended and added certain provisions and definitions to increase the credit availability, renew the facility, which is subject to renewal every 364 days until May 26, 2017, and extend the facility's termination date to May 27, 2019.  While we expect to continue to renew this facility, we would be required to use cash, our Corporate Credit Agreement or other sources to repay any outstanding balance on the Receivables Facility if it were not renewed. 
  The Company s primary uses of cash are for capital expenditures and debt service and, to a lesser extent, to fund pension and retiree medical obligations and preferred stock dividends.  The Company believes that its cash on hand, cash generated from operations, and available funding under its credit facilities will be adequate to meet its cash requirements in 2016.  In addition, management expects that the Company will continue to have access to the capital markets to refinance debt and other obligations should such a need arise in the near future.   
  In the second quarter of 2016, we sold 3.1 million shares of CyrusOne Inc. common stock for net proceeds of $142.5 million.  In the third quarter of 2016, we sold   0.8 million   shares of CyrusOne Inc. common stock for net proceeds totaling   $38.7 million  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned 3.0 million shares of registered common stock of CyrusOne Inc. valued at $144.3 million.  We intend to sell down the Company's ownership interest in CyrusOne and use the proceeds to primarily repay long-term debt and for other general corporate purposes.  Our amended Corporate Credit Agreement obligates us to use 85% of the proceeds towards debt repayments, subject to the terms and conditions within the amended agreement.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was below the 4:00 to 1:00 Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined by the Corporate Credit Agreement).  Therefore, the requirements to use 85% of proceeds from a CyrusOne monetization towards debt repayments are currently not applicable.  
  Cash Flows 
  Cash provided by operating activities during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   totaled   $141.7 million  , an increase of   $47.0 million   compared to the same period in   2015  .  The increase is primarily due to $16.9 million of lower interest payments compared to the prior year and a decline in pension and postretirement payments of $10.4 million.  In addition, the Company's discontinued wireless operations used $24.5 million of cash in the first nine months of 2015, compared to $5.0 million used in 2016. 
  Cash flows used by investing activities during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   totaled   $92.9 million  , compared to   $410.5 million   provided by investing activities in the same period of   2015  .  The decrease is primarily driven by the year-over-year decrease in proceeds received on the sale of the Company's CyrusOne investment.  In the third quarter of 2016, the Company deposited   $90.7 million   of funds into a restricted cash account to redeem the remaining balance of the 8    3   /   8   % Senior Notes due 2020.  During 2016, dividends received from CyrusOne decreased by   $13.3 million  , but were more than offset by a   $16.9 million   decrease in capital expenditures.

Cash flows used by financing activities during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   totaled   $47.7 million  , compared to   $537.7 million   used in the prior year.  In the third quarter of 2016, the Company issued $425.0 million of 7% Senior Notes due 2024, resulting in an   $8.0 million   increase in debt issuance costs in 2016 over the prior year.  Debt repayments decreased by   $48.8 million   compared to the prior year, due primarily to a decrease in proceeds from the sale of our CyrusOne investment, partially offset by the $312.5 million repaid during the third quarter of 2016 with net proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 Notes.  In the first nine months of 2016, we borrowed   $5.9 million   on the Receivables Facility, compared to repaying   $19.2 million   in the same period of   2015  .  We also repurchased and retired approximately 0.2 million shares of the Company's common stock for $  4.8 million  . 
  Debt Covenants 
  Corporate Credit Agreement 
  The Corporate Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that require we maintain certain leverage and interest coverage ratios and limits our capital expenditures on an annual and aggregate basis until we sell the remainder of CyrusOne investment.  The facility also contains certain covenants which, among other things, limit the Company s ability to incur additional debt or liens, pay dividends, repurchase Company common stock, sell, transfer, lease, or dispose of assets, and make certain investments or merge with another company.  If the Company was to violate any of its covenants and was unable to obtain a waiver, it would be considered in default.  If the Company was in default under its Corporate Credit Agreement, no additional borrowings under the Corporate Credit Agreement would be available until the default was waived or cured.  The Company was in compliance with all of the covenants under the Corporate Credit Agreement as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  The Company's ability to make restricted payments, which include share repurchases and common stock dividends, is limited to a total of $15 million given that our Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Corporate Credit Agreement, exceeds 3.50 to 1.00 as of   September 30, 2016  .  The Company may make restricted payments of $45 million annually when the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio is less than or equal to 3.50 to 1.00.  There are no dollar limits on restricted payments when the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio is less than or equal to 3.00 to 1.00.  These restricted payment limitations do not impact the Company's ability to make regularly scheduled dividend payments on its 6    3   /  4  % Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock.  Furthermore, the Company may make restricted payments in the form of share repurchases or dividends up to 15% of CyrusOne sale proceeds, subject to a $35 million annual cap with carryovers and subject to terms and conditions set forth in the Corporate Credit Agreement. 
  The Corporate Credit Agreement provides that the Tranche B Term Loan participates in mandatory prepayments subject to the terms and conditions (including with respect to payment priority) set forth in the restated Corporate Credit Agreement.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was below the 4:00 to 1:00 Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined by the Corporate Credit Agreement).  Therefore, the requirements to use 85% of proceeds from a CyrusOne monetization towards debt repayments are currently not applicable.  
  In order to continue to have access to the amounts available to it under the Corporate Credit Agreement, the Company must remain in compliance with all of the covenants.  The following table presents the calculations of the most restrictive debt covenant, the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as of and for the twelve month period ended   September 30, 2016  : 
                   (dollars in millions) 
      
      Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio 
    3.90 
      
      Maximum ratio permitted for compliance 
    5.50 
      
      Consolidated Total Funded Indebtedness additional availability 
    473.1 
      
      Consolidated EBITDA clearance over compliance threshold 
    86.0 

Definitions and components of these calculations are detailed in our Corporate Credit Agreement and can be found in the Company's Form 8-K filed on May 17, 2016.   
  Bond Indentures 
  The Company s debt, which includes the 7% Senior Notes due 2024, contains covenants that, among other things, limit the Company s ability to incur additional debt or liens, pay dividends or make other restricted payments, sell, transfer, lease, or dispose of assets and make investments or merge with another company. The Company is in compliance with all of its debt indentures.

One of the financial covenants permits the issuance of additional indebtedness up to a 5:00 to 1:00 Consolidated Adjusted Senior Debt to EBITDA Ratio (as defined by the individual indentures).  Once the Company exceeds this ratio, the Company is not in default under the terms of the indentures; however, additional indebtedness may only be incurred in specified permitted baskets, including a basket which allows $750 million of total Corporate Credit Agreement debt (Revolver and Term Loans).  We also have baskets for capital lease incurrences, borrowings against the Receivables Facility, refinancings of existing debt, and other debt incurrences.  In addition, the Company's ability to make restricted payments, which include share repurchases, repayment of subordinated notes, preferred stock redemptions and common stock dividends, would be limited to specific allowances.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was below the 5:00 to 1:00 Consolidated Adjusted Senior Debt to EBITDA ratio, and the Company had access to the restricted payments basket which approximated $1 billion. 
  Share Repurchase Plan 
  In 2010, the Board of Directors approved a plan for the repurchase of the Company's outstanding common stock in an amount up to $  150.0 million  .  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company repurchased and retired approximately 0.2 million shares of its common stock for   $4.6 million  .  During the third quarter of 2016, common shares repurchases totaled $0.2 million.  In prior years, the Company repurchased and retired a total of 1.5 million shares at a total cost of   $20.8 million  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has the authority to repurchase its common stock with a value of up to $  124.4 million   under the plan approved by its Board of Directors, subject to satisfaction of the requirements under its bond indentures and Corporate Credit Agreement.   
  Regulatory Matters 
  Special Access/Business Data Services 
  In 2005, the FCC opened a proceeding to review the current special access pricing rules.  Under the existing rules, special access services are subject to price cap regulation with no earnings cap, and ILECs are entitled to pricing flexibility in metropolitan statistical areas served by a sufficient number of competitors.  During 2012, the FCC suspended the grant of any new pricing flexibility requests and issued a mandatory data request.  Responses to the data request were provided in the first quarter of 2015.  During the second quarter of 2016, the FCC proposed a new framework for identifying competitive markets and sought comment on how to regulate in non-competitive markets.  The FCC commissioners are currently considering a draft order circulated by the FCC Chairman that would force an initial adjustment in addition to ongoing annual legacy TDM-based special access rate reductions.  The proposal could also negatively impact Ethernet revenue by instituting a complaint process whereby purchasers could seek reductions in Ethernet prices comparable to those for TDM services. 
  Broadband Internet Access/Net Neutrality 
  In an order adopted in 2005, the FCC provided wireline carriers the option of offering broadband Internet access as a non-regulated information service (comparable treatment to cable modem Internet access at that time) or as a regulated telecommunications service. In 2007, CBT elected the non-regulated information service designation for its broadband Internet access service.  The FCC also ruled that wireless broadband service is a non-regulated information service, placing it on the same regulatory footing as other broadband services such as cable modem service and wireline DSL service.  
  In conjunction with the adoption of the 2005 wireline broadband Internet access order, the FCC adopted a policy statement intended to ensure that broadband networks are widely deployed, open, affordable, and accessible to all consumers.  In April 2010, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion finding that an FCC enforcement action regarding Comcast's network management practices exceeded the FCC's authority, causing the FCC to reassess its approach to crafting net neutrality rules.  In December 2010, the FCC adopted net neutrality rules that required broadband providers to publicly disclose network management practices, restricted them from blocking Internet content and applications, and prohibited fixed broadband providers from engaging in unreasonable discrimination in transmitting traffic.  In January 2014, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the net neutrality order s anti-blocking and anti-discrimination requirements finding that they were akin to common carrier regulation.  However, the Court upheld the transparency and disclosure requirements and found that the FCC has general authority under Section 706 of the Communications Act to promulgate rules to encourage broadband deployment.  In response to the Court s decision, the FCC adopted new rules in February 2015 under which it reclassified broadband Internet access as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act.  Although the FCC has currently decided to forbear from applying many of the traditional common carrier regulations to the reclassified broadband Internet access service, the potential for more onerous utility-style regulation (for example, rate regulation) adds uncertainty regarding the ultimate regulatory treatment of broadband Internet access service.  The 2015 Order was appealed by numerous parties, but in June 2016 the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the FCC s 2015 Order in its entirety, which enables the FCC to move forward with enforcement of the Open Internet rules.  Since then, the FCC has imposed monetary fines for practices allegedly in violation of the Open Internet Transparency rule.  In addition, the FCC adopted an order in October establishing broadband privacy and security requirements for Internet service providers.  The new rules could impose additional costs on internet-service providers

("ISPs") to meet the standards set by the rules and could limit the ability of these broadband providers to market other related services to their broadband customers.  Moreover, by applying more onerous restrictions on ISPs relative to edge providers, ISPs could be adversely impacted compared with other on-line digital advertisers who do not face the same type of restrictions as the FCC is contemplating applying to ISPs.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. 
    Legal Proceedings 
     Cincinnati Bell and its subsidiaries are involved in a number of legal proceedings.  Liabilities are established for legal claims when losses associated with the claims are judged to be probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated.  In many lawsuits and arbitrations, including most class action lawsuits, it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the amount of the liability until the case is close to resolution, in which case a liability will not be recognized until that time.  Based on information currently available, consultation with counsel, available insurance coverage and recognized liabilities, the Company believes that the eventual outcome of all claims will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material effect on the Company s financial position or results of operations.    

Item 1A.    Risk Factors 
  Refer to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   for a comprehensive listing of the Company s risk factors.  
  The regulation of the Company s businesses by federal and state authorities may, among other things, place the Company at a competitive disadvantage, restrict its ability to price its products and services, and threaten its operating licenses. 
  Several of the Company s subsidiaries are subject to regulatory oversight of varying degrees at both the state and federal levels, which may differ from the regulatory scrutiny faced by the Company s competitors. A significant portion of CBT s revenue is derived from pricing plans that require regulatory overview and approval. These regulated pricing plans limit the rates CBT charges for some services while the competition has typically been able to set rates for services with limited restriction. In the future, regulatory initiatives that would put CBT at a competitive disadvantage or mandate lower rates for its services would result in lower profitability and cash flows for the Company. In addition, different regulatory interpretations of existing regulations or guidelines may affect the Company s revenues and expenses in future periods. 
  At the federal level, CBT is subject to the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the "1996 Act"), including the rules subsequently adopted by the FCC to implement the 1996 Act, which has impacted CBT s in-territory local exchange operations in the form of greater competition. At the state level, CBT conducts local exchange operations in portions of Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana, and, consequently, is subject to regulation by the Public Utilities Commissions in those states. Various regulatory decisions or initiatives at the federal or state level may from time to time have a negative impact on CBT s ability to compete in its markets.   
  The FCC is currently considering a proposal that would force an initial adjustment in addition to annual reductions in the Company s legacy TDM-based special access rates.  The proposal could also negatively impact Ethernet revenue by instituting a complaint process whereby purchasers could seek reductions in Ethernet prices comparable to those for TDM services.  In addition, the FCC adopted an order in October establishing broadband privacy and security requirements for Internet service providers.  The new rules could impose additional costs on the Company to meet the standards set by the rules and could limit the ability of the Company to market other related services to its broadband customers.    
  In the second quarter of 2016, the FCC initiated a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to consider changes in Business Data Services (BDS, also known as Special Access Services) regulation.  In the proposal, the FCC considers various options for defining competitive versus non-competitive markets and methods of regulating rates in markets determined to be non-competitive.  Until final rules are adopted (possibly in the fourth quarter of 2016) the Company is unable to determine the impact of the changes.  
  There are currently many other regulatory actions under way and being contemplated by federal and state authorities regarding issues that could result in significant changes to the business conditions in the telecommunications industry. In addition, in connection with our Internet access offerings, we could become subject to laws and regulations as they are adopted or applied to the Internet, particularly, now that the FCC's reclassification of Internet access as a Title II service has been upheld in court. We cannot provide any assurances that changes in current or future regulations adopted by the FCC or state regulators, or other legislative, administrative, or judicial initiatives relating to the telecommunications industry, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
  From time to time, different regulatory agencies conduct audits to ensure that the Company is in compliance with the respective regulations. The Company could be subject to fines and penalties if found to be out of compliance with these regulations, and these fines and penalties could be material to the Company s financial condition.
