  Our Global Delivery Network continues to be a competitive differentiator for us. As of August 31, 2016, we had approximately   285,000   professionals in our network globally in more than 50 delivery centers around the world, as well as Accenture offices and client locations. 
  Alliances  
  We have sales and delivery alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own by, among other things, enhancing a service offering, delivering a new technology or helping us extend our services to new geographies. By combining our alliance partners  products and services with our own capabilities and expertise, we create innovative, high-value business solutions for our clients. Most of our alliances are non-exclusive. These alliances can generate significant revenues from services we provide to implement our alliance partners  products as well as revenue from the resale of their products. We also receive as reimbursement some direct payments, which are not material to our business, from our alliance partners to cover costs we incur for marketing and other assistance.  
  Research and Innovation  
  We are committed to developing leading-edge ideas. Research and innovation, which is a component of our overall investment in our business, have been major factors in our success, and we believe they will help us continue to grow in the future. We use our investment in research and development on which we spent $643 million, $626 million and $640 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively to help create, commercialize and disseminate innovative business strategies and technology solutions. We spend a significant portion of our research and development investment to develop market-ready solutions for our clients. 
  Our research and innovation program is designed to generate early insights into how knowledge can be harnessed to create innovative business solutions for our clients and to develop business strategies with significant value. Our innovation capabilities include research and thought leadership to identify market and technology trends. We also partner with and invest in growth-stage companies that create innovative enterprise technologies. Our Accenture Labs incubate and prototype new concepts through applied research and development projects. In addition, our studios, innovation centers and delivery centers build, scale and industrialize the delivery of our innovations.  
  Employees  
  As a talent-led organization, one of our key goals is to have the best talent, with highly specialized skills in each part of our business, at the right levels in the right locations, to enhance our differentiation and competitiveness. We are deeply committed to the career development of our employees, who receive significant and focused technical, functional, industry, managerial and leadership skill development and training appropriate for their roles and levels within the Company. We provide our people with expert content and opportunities to collaborate in a broad range of

physical and virtual learning environments. We seek to reinforce our employees  commitments to our clients, culture and values through a comprehensive performance management and compensation system and a career philosophy that provides rewards based on individual and Company performance. With our commitment to inclusion and diversity, we strive to maintain a work environment that reinforces collaboration, motivation and innovation and is consistent with our core values and Code of Business Ethics.  
  As of August 31, 2016, we employed approximately 384,000 people and had offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 55 countries.  
  Competition  
  We operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing global marketplace and compete with a variety of organizations that offer services and solutions competitive with those we offer. Our competitors include:  
             
    large multinational providers, including the services arms of large global technology providers (hardware, equipment and software), that offer some or all of the services and solutions that we do; 
                
    off-shore service providers in lower-cost locations, particularly in India, that offer services globally that are similar to the services and solutions we offer;  
                
    accounting firms that provide consulting and other services and solutions in areas that compete with us;  
                
    niche solution or service providers or local competitors that compete with us in a specific geographic market, industry segment or service area, including digital agencies and emerging start-ups and other companies that can scale rapidly to focus on certain markets and provide new or alternative products, services or delivery models; and 
                
    in-house departments of large corporations that use their own resources, rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services and solutions we provide. 
     Our revenues are derived primarily from Fortune Global 500 and Fortune 1000 companies, medium-sized companies, governments, government agencies and other enterprises. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the industries in which we compete include:  
             
    skills and capabilities of people;  
                
    technical and industry expertise;  
                
    innovative service and product offerings;  
                
    ability to add business value and improve performance;  
                
    reputation and client references;  
                
    contractual terms, including competitive pricing;  
                
    ability to deliver results reliably and on a timely basis;

  We provide value to our clients based in part on a differentiated range of proprietary inventions, methodologies, software, reusable knowledge capital and other intellectual property. We recognize the increasing value of intellectual property in the marketplace and create, harvest, and protect this intellectual property. We leverage patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws as well as contractual arrangements to protect our intellectual property. We have also established policies to respect the intellectual property rights of third parties, such as our clients, partners and others.  
  As of August 31, 2016, we had over 2,475 patent applications pending worldwide and had been issued over 1,250 U.S. patents and 1,750 non-U.S. patents.

Organizational Structure 
  Accenture plc is an Irish public limited company with no material assets other than ordinary and deferred shares in its subsidiary, Accenture Holdings plc, an Irish public limited company. Accenture plc owns a majority voting interest in Accenture Holdings plc, and Accenture plc s only business is to hold these shares. As a result, Accenture plc controls Accenture Holdings plc s management and operations and consolidates Accenture Holdings plc s results in its Consolidated Financial Statements. We operate our business through subsidiaries of Accenture Holdings plc. Accenture Holdings plc generally reimburses Accenture plc for its expenses but does not pay Accenture plc any fees.  
  History 
  Prior to our transition to a corporate structure in fiscal 2001, we operated as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of our partners. In connection with our transition to a corporate structure, our partners generally exchanged all of their interests in these partnerships and corporations for Accenture Ltd Class A common shares or, in the case of partners in certain countries, Class I common shares of Accenture SCA, a Luxembourg partnership limited by shares and direct subsidiary of Accenture Ltd ( Accenture SCA ), or exchangeable shares issued by Accenture Canada Holdings Inc., an indirect subsidiary of Accenture SCA. Generally, partners who received Accenture SCA Class I common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares also received a corresponding number of Accenture Ltd Class X common shares, which entitled their holders to vote at Accenture Ltd shareholder meetings but did not carry any economic rights. The combination of the Accenture Ltd Class X common shares and the Accenture SCA Class I common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares gave these partners substantially similar economic and governance rights as holders of Accenture Ltd Class A common shares. 
  On June 10, 2009, Accenture plc was incorporated in Ireland, as a public limited company, in order to effect moving the place of incorporation of our parent holding company from Bermuda to Ireland. This transaction was completed on September 1, 2009, at which time Accenture Ltd, our predecessor holding company, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Accenture plc and Accenture plc became our parent holding company. Accenture Ltd was dissolved on December 29, 2009. 
  On April 10, 2015, Accenture Holdings plc was incorporated in Ireland, as a public limited company, in order to further consolidate Accenture s presence in Ireland. On August 26, 2015, Accenture SCA merged with and into Accenture Holdings plc, with Accenture Holdings plc as the surviving entity. This merger was a transaction between entities under common control and had no effect on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  All references to Accenture Holdings plc included in this report with respect to periods prior to August 26, 2015 reflect the activity and/or balances of Accenture SCA (the predecessor of Accenture Holdings plc). The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the ownership interests in Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by certain current and former members of Accenture Leadership as noncontrolling interests.  Accenture Leadership  is comprised of members of our global management committee (the Company s primary management and leadership team, which consists of approximately 20 of our most senior leaders), senior managing directors and managing directors. The noncontrolling ownership interests percentage was 4% as of August 31, 2016.  
  Accenture plc Class A and Class X Ordinary Shares 
  Each Class A ordinary share and each Class X ordinary share of Accenture plc entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of Accenture plc. A Class X ordinary share does not, however, entitle its holder to receive dividends or to receive payments upon a liquidation of Accenture plc. As described above under   History,  Class X ordinary shares generally provide the holders of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares with a vote at Accenture plc shareholder meetings that is equivalent to the voting rights held by Accenture plc Class A ordinary shareholders, while their economic rights consist of interests in Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares or in Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares. 
  Under its memorandum and articles of association, Accenture plc may redeem, at its option, any Class X ordinary share for a redemption price equal to the nominal value of the Class X ordinary share, or $0.0000225 per share. Accenture plc, as successor to Accenture Ltd, has separately agreed with the original holders of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares not to redeem any Class X ordinary share of such holder if the redemption would reduce the number of Class X ordinary shares held by that holder to a number that is less than the number of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares owned by that holder. Accenture plc will redeem Class X ordinary shares upon the redemption or exchange of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares so that the aggregate number of Class X ordinary shares outstanding at any time does not exceed the aggregate number  
  
   7 

     Table of Contents  

of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares outstanding. Class X ordinary shares are not transferable without the consent of Accenture plc. 
  A transfer of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares effected by transfer of a book-entry interest in The Depository Trust Company will not be subject to Irish stamp duty. Other transfers of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares may be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the price paid or the market value of the Class A ordinary shares acquired, if higher) payable by the buyer. 
  Accenture Holdings plc Ordinary and Deferred Shares 
  Only Accenture plc, Accenture Holdings plc, Accenture International S. .r.l.     and certain current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees hold Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares. Each ordinary share entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to the shareholders of Accenture Holdings plc and entitles its holder to dividends and liquidation payments. As of October 14, 2016, Accenture plc holds a voting interest of approximately 96% of the aggregate outstanding Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares entitled to vote, with the remaining 4% of the voting interest held by certain current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. 
  Only Accenture plc beneficially holds Accenture Holdings plc deferred shares. The deferred shares were issued solely to ensure that Accenture Holdings plc satisfies Irish law minimum share capital requirements for public limited companies at all times and carry no voting rights or income rights and have only limited rights on a return of capital equal to the nominal value of those shares. 
  Holders of ordinary shares of Accenture Holdings plc have the ability, subject to the restrictions on redemption contained in Accen  ture   Holdings plc s articles of association and the Companies Act 2014 of Ireland (the  Companies Act ) and any contractual restrictions on redemption that may be applicable to a holder, to require that Accenture Holdings plc redeem all or a portion of such holder s ordinary shares of Accenture Holdings plc. In that case, Accenture Holdings plc is obligated, subject to the availability of distributable reserves, to redeem any such ordinary shares of Accenture Holdings plc. The redemption price per share generally equals the average of the high and low sale prices of a Class A ordinary share of Accenture plc as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the trading day on which Accenture Holdings plc receives an irrevocable notice of redemption from a holder of ordinary shares of Accenture Holdings plc if received prior to close of trading for that day, or on the following trading day if Accenture Holdings plc receives the irrevocable notice of redemption later than the close of trading on that day. Accenture Holdings plc may, at its option, pay the redemption price in cash or by instructing Accenture plc to deliver Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment for dividends and share splits. In order to maintain Accenture plc s economic interest in Accenture Holdings plc, Accenture plc generally will acquire additional Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares each time additional Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares are issued. 
  Except in the case of a redemption of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares or a transfer of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares to Accenture plc or one of its subsidiaries, Accenture Holdings plc s articles of association provide that Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares may be transferred only with the consent of the Board of Directors of Accenture Holdings plc. In addition, all holders of ordinary shares (except Accenture plc) are precluded from having their shares redeemed by Accenture Holdings plc or transferred to Accenture Holdings plc, Accenture plc or a subsidiary of Accenture plc at any time or during any period when Accenture Holdings plc determines, based on the advice of counsel, that there is material non-public information that may affect the average price per share of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, if the redemption would be prohibited by applicable law or regulation, or during the period from the announcement of a tender offer by Accenture Holdings plc or its affiliates for Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares, or any securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, ordinary shares, until the expiration of ten business days after the termination of the tender offer (other than to tender the holder s Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares in the tender offer). 
  Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares 
  Holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares may exchange their shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares at any time on a one-for-one basis. Accenture may, at its option, satisfy this exchange with cash at a price per share generally equal to the market price of an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share at the time of the exchange. Each exchangeable share of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. entitles its holder to receive distributions equal to any distributions to which an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share entitles its holder. The exchange of all of the outstanding Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares would not have a material impact on the equity ownership position of Accenture or the other shareholders of Accenture Holdings plc.

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS  
  In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) and/or stock price. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies, including us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or stock price.  
  Our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients  businesses and levels of business activity. 
  Global macroeconomic conditions affect our clients  businesses and the markets they serve. Volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions in our significant markets have undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets or in other markets, which are increasingly interdependent, and cause our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new initiatives and technologies, or may result in clients reducing, delaying or eliminating spending under existing contracts with us, which would negatively affect our business. Growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate, or could stagnate or contract, in each case, for an extended period of time. Differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth and contraction in the geographical regions in which we operate and the industries we serve have affected and may in the future affect demand for our services and solutions. A material portion of our revenues and profitability is derived from our clients in North America and Europe. Weak demand in these markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, because we operate globally and have significant businesses in markets outside of North America and Europe, an economic slowdown in one or more of those other markets could adversely affect our results of operations as well. Ongoing economic volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns affect our business in a number of other ways, including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plans, particularly in consulting. 
  Economic volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effects and changes in demand patterns resulting from these and other factors to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations. Changing demand patterns from economic volatility and uncertainty could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations. 
  Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations.  
  Our revenue and profitability depend on the demand for our services and solutions with favorable margins, which could be negatively affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product. As described above, volatile, negative or uncertain global economic conditions and lower growth in the markets we serve have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our services and solutions. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and offerings to serve the evolving needs of our clients. Examples of areas of significant change include digital-, cloud- and security-related offerings, which are continually evolving as developments such as artificial intelligence, automation, blockchain, Internet of Things and as-a-service solutions are commercialized. Technological developments such as these may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and, in the case of as-a-service solutions, could affect the nature of how we generate revenue. Some of these technologies, such as cloud-based services, artificial intelligence and automation, and others that may emerge, have reduced and replaced some of our historical services and solutions and may continue to do so in the future. This has caused, and may in the future cause, clients to delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies. Such delays can negatively impact our results of operations if the pace and level of spending on new technologies is not sufficient to make up any shortfall.  
  Developments in the industries we serve, which may be rapid, also could shift demand to new services and solutions. If, as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve, our clients demand new services and solutions, we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand. Our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry developments, or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation, our services and

     Table of Contents  

solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be negatively affected.  
  We operate in a rapidly evolving environment in which there currently are, and we expect will continue to be, new technology entrants. New services or technologies offered by competitors or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive when compared to other alternatives, which may adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, companies in the industries we serve sometimes seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies. If one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for the services and solutions we offer, we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work if we are not successful in generating new opportunities from the merger or consolidation. At any given time in a particular industry or geography, one or a small number of clients could contribute a significant portion of our revenues, and any decision by such a client to delay, reduce, or eliminate spending on our services and solutions could have a disproportionate impact on the results of operations in the relevant industry and/or geography.  
  Many of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration, and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days  notice. Longer-term, larger and more complex contracts, such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts, generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us, but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract. Many of our contracts allow clients to terminate, delay, reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide. Additionally, a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work. When contracts are terminated or not renewed, we lose the anticipated revenues, and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenues lost. Consequently, our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected. The specific business or financial condition of a client, changes in management and changes in a client s strategy are also all factors that can result in terminations, cancellations or delays. 
  If we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. 
  Our success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally. Experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand, and competition for talent is intense. We must hire, retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing technology, industry and macroeconomic developments and grow and manage our business. For example, if we are unable to hire or continually train our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuing changes in technology and the industries we serve or changes in the types of services and solutions clients are demanding, we may not be able to develop and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand. As we expand our services and solutions, we must also hire and retain an increasing number of professionals with different skills and professional expectations than those of the professionals we have historically hired and retained. Additionally, if we are unable to successfully integrate, motivate and retain these professionals, our ability to continue to secure work in those industries and for our services and solutions may suffer. 
  We are particularly dependent on retaining members of Accenture Leadership and other experienced managers, and if we are unable to do so, our ability to develop new business and effectively manage our current contracts and client relationships could be jeopardized. We depend on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide leadership and direction for our businesses. This includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in emerging markets, where the depth of skilled employees is often limited and competition for these resources is intense. Our ability to expand geographically depends, in large part, on our ability to attract, retain and integrate both leaders for the local business and people with the appropriate skills. 
  Similarly, our profitability depends on our ability to effectively utilize personnel with the right mix of skills and experience to perform services for our clients, including our ability to transition employees to new assignments on a timely basis. If we are unable to effectively deploy our employees globally on a timely basis to fulfill the needs of our clients, our profitability could suffer. If the utilization rate of our professionals is too high, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition, the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects. If our utilization rate is too low, our profitability and the engagement of our employees could suffer. The costs associated with recruiting and training employees are significant. An important element of our global business model is the deployment of our employees around the world, which allows us to move talent as needed. Therefore, if we are not able to deploy the talent we need because of increased regulation of immigration or work visas, including limitations  
  
   10 

     Table of Contents  

placed on the number of visas granted, limitations on the type of work performed or location in which the work can be performed, and new or higher minimum salary requirements, it could be more difficult to staff our employees on client engagements and could increase our costs.  
  Our equity-based incentive compensation plans are designed to reward high-performing personnel for their contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us. If the anticipated value of such incentives does not materialize because of volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price, or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, our ability to attract and retain the personnel we need could be adversely affected. In addition, if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting equity awards under our share plans in the amounts we believe are necessary, our ability to attract and retain personnel could be negatively affected. 
  There is a risk that at certain points in time, and in certain geographical regions, we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current and/or future demand. In these cases, we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs, and if not done effectively, our profitability could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if demand for our services and solutions were to escalate at a high rate, we may need to adjust our compensation practices, which could put upward pressure on our costs and adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to recover these increased costs. At certain times, however, we may also have more personnel than we need in certain skill sets or geographies or at compensation levels that are not aligned with skill sets. In these situations, we have engaged, and may in the future engage, in actions to rebalance our resources, including through reduced levels of new hiring and increased involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand. If we are not successful in these initiatives, our results of operations could be adversely affected.  
  The markets in which we compete are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively.  
  The markets in which we offer our services and solutions are highly competitive. Our competitors include:  
             
    large multinational providers, including the services arms of large global technology providers (hardware, equipment and software), that offer some or all of the services and solutions that we do; 
                
    off-shore service providers in lower-cost locations, particularly in India, that offer services globally that are similar to the services and solutions we offer;  
                
    accounting firms that provide consulting and other services and solutions in areas that compete with us;  
                
    niche solution or service providers or local competitors that compete with us in a specific geographic market, industry segment or service area, including digital agencies and emerging start-ups and other companies that can scale rapidly to focus on certain markets and provide new or alternative products, services or delivery models; and 
                
    in-house departments of large corporations that use their own resources, rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services and solutions we provide. 
     Some competitors may have greater financial, marketing or other resources than we do and, therefore, may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals, may be able to innovate and provide new services and solutions faster than we can or may be able to anticipate the need for services and solutions before we do. 
  Even if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs, competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer, including to companies that are our clients. Some competitors are more established in certain markets, and that may make executing our geographic expansion strategy in these markets more challenging. Additionally, competitors may also offer more aggressive contractual terms, which may affect our ability to win work. Our future performance is largely dependent on our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve, while expanding into additional markets. If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and clients to competitors, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.  
  In addition, we may face greater competition due to consolidation of companies in the technology sector through strategic mergers or acquisitions. Consolidation activity may result in new competitors with greater scale, a broader footprint or offerings that are more attractive than ours. Over time, our access to certain technology products and services may be reduced as a result of this consolidation. Additionally, vertically integrated companies are able to offer as a single provider more integrated services (software and hardware) to clients than we can in some cases and therefore may represent a more attractive alternative to clients. If buyers of services favor using a single provider for an integrated technology stack, such buyers may direct more business to such competitors, and this could materially adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations.

We could have liability or our reputation could be damaged if we fail to protect client and/or Accenture data from security breaches or cyberattacks.  
  We are dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients, alliance partners and vendors. As the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow, including as a result of the use of mobile technologies, social media and cloud-based services, the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks increases. Such breaches could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information, including personal data.  
  In providing services and solutions to clients, we often manage, utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or Accenture data, including personal data, and we expect these activities to increase, including through the use of analytics. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or Accenture data, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, could damage our reputation, cause us to lose clients and could result in significant financial exposure. Similarly, unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients, whether by our employees or third parties, including a cyberattack by computer programmers, hackers, members of organized crime and/or state-sponsored organizations, who may develop and deploy viruses or other malicious software programs or social engineering attacks, could result in negative publicity, significant remediation costs, legal liability, damage to our reputation and government sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending against them. 
  We are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as the national laws implementing the European Union Directive on Data Protection (which will be replaced by the European Union General Data Protection Regulation from 2018 onwards), various U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information and data privacy and cybersecurity laws in other regions. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and sometimes conflict among the various countries in which we operate. If any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or Accenture data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions. These monetary damages might not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages and could be significant. In addition, our liability insurance, which includes cyber insurance, might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyberattacks and other related breaches. 
  Our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, if we are unable to remain competitive, if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies. 
  Our profitability is highly dependent on a variety of factors and could be materially impacted by any of the following: 
  Our results of operations could materially suffer if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing to meet our profitability expectations.   If we are not able to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, our revenues and profitability could materially suffer. The rates we are able to charge for our services and solutions are affected by a number of factors, including:  
             
    general economic and political conditions;  
                
    our clients  desire to reduce their costs;  
                
    the competitive environment in our industry;  
                
    our ability to accurately estimate our service delivery costs, upon which our pricing is sometimes determined, includes our ability to estimate the impact of inflation and foreign exchange on our service delivery costs over long-term contracts; and  
                
    the procurement practices of clients and their use of third-party advisors.  
     Our profitability could suffer if we are not able to remain competitive.   The competitive environment in our industry affects our ability to secure new contracts at our target economics in a number of ways, any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations. The less we are able to differentiate our services and solutions and/or clearly convey the value of our services and solutions, the more risk we have in winning new work in sufficient volumes and at our target pricing and overall economics. In addition, the introduction of new services or products by competitors could reduce our ability to obtain favorable pricing and impact our overall economics for the services or solutions we offer. Competitors may be willing, at times, to price contracts lower than us in an effort to enter the market or increase market share.

Our profitability could suffer if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful, and we may not be able to improve our profitability to the degree we have done in the past.   Our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs. Our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and solutions and our resource capacity. We have also taken actions to reduce certain costs, and these initiatives include, without limitation, re-alignment of portions of our workforce to lower-cost locations and the use of involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance. These actions and our other cost-management efforts may not be successful, our efficiency may not be enhanced and we may not achieve desired levels of profitability. Because of the significant steps taken in the past to manage costs, it may become increasingly difficult to continue to manage our cost structure to the same degree as in the past. If we are not effective in managing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing, or if we are unable to recover employee compensation increases through improved pricing, automation or the movement of     work to lower-cost locations, we may not be able to continue to invest in our business in an amount necessary to achieve our planned rates of growth, we may not be able to reward our people in the manner we believe is necessary to attract or retain personnel at desired levels, and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  
  If we do not accurately anticipate the cost, risk and complexity of performing our work or if third parties upon whom we rely do not meet their commitments, then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be less profitable than expected or unprofitable.   Our contract profitability is highly dependent on our forecasts regarding the effort and cost necessary to deliver our services and solutions, which are based on available data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate. If we do not accurately estimate the effort, costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments and/or completing engagements to a client s satisfaction, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable. Similarly, if we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management, the failure of third parties to meet their commitments or for any other reason, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable. In particular, large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software, systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers, including companies with which we have alliances. Our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors, vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner and in accordance with the project requirements, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance. In some cases, these subcontractors are small firms, and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with large-scale engagements or enterprises. Some of this work involves new technologies, which may not work as intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted. In addition, certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances, some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control. Any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with clients and on our results of operations.  
  Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.  
  We are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. We calculate and provide for taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. Tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are subject to ongoing audits, investigations and tax proceedings in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities have disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with our judgments, or may take increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make, including with respect to our intercompany transactions. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits, investigations and tax proceedings to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities. However, our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits, investigations and tax proceedings, and the amounts ultimately paid could be materially different from the amounts previously recorded. In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by the expiration of current tax benefits, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, challenges to our intercompany transactions, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement. Tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change as a result of macroeconomic or other factors outside of our control. In addition, changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, have become more unpredictable and may become more stringent, which could materially adversely affect our tax position.  
  The overall tax environment has made it increasingly challenging for multinational corporations to operate with certainty about taxation in many jurisdictions. For example, the European Commission has been conducting investigations, focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provide preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules. In addition, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development,  
  
   13 

     Table of Contents  

which represents a coalition of member countries, is supporting changes to numerous long-standing tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting project, which is focused on a number of issues, including the shifting of profits among affiliated entities located in different tax jurisdictions. Furthermore, a number of countries where we do business, including the United States and many countries in the European Union, are considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to multinational corporations. The increasingly complex global tax environment could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.  
  Although we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the United States and Ireland, legislative or diplomatic action could be taken, or the treaty may be amended in such a way, that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty. Our inability to rely on the treaty would subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense. In addition, congressional proposals could change the definition of a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could also subject us to increased taxation. In addition, we could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy (or in their interpretation or enforcement) in Ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate, including their treaties with Ireland or the United States. These changes could be exacerbated by economic, budget or other challenges facing Ireland or these other jurisdictions.  
  Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
  Although we report our results of operations in U.S. dollars, a majority of our net revenues is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had an adverse effect, and could in the future have a material adverse effect, on our results of operations.  
  Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, expenses and income, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies will affect our net revenues, operating income and the value of balance-sheet items, including intercompany payables and receivables, originally denominated in other currencies. These changes cause our growth in consolidated earnings stated in U.S. dollars to be higher or lower than our growth in local currency when compared against other periods. Our currency hedging programs, which are designed to partially offset the impact on consolidated earnings related to the changes in value of certain balance sheet items, might not be successful. Additionally, some transactions and balances may be denominated in currencies for which there is no available market to hedge. 
  As we continue to leverage our global delivery model, more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services. An increase in the value of certain currencies, such as the Indian rupee or Philippine peso, against the currencies in which our revenue is recorded could increase costs for delivery of services at off-shore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency. Our contractual provisions or cost management efforts might not be able to offset their impact, and our currency hedging activities, which are designed to partially offset this impact, might not be successful. This could result in a decrease in the profitability of our contracts that are utilizing delivery center resources. Conversely, a decrease in the value of certain currencies, such as the Indian rupee or Philippine peso, against the currencies in which our revenue is recorded could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to service providers that benefit to a greater degree from such a decrease and can, as a result, deliver services at a lower cost. In addition, our currency hedging activities are themselves subject to risk. These include risks related to counterparty performance under hedging contracts, risks related to ineffective hedges and risks related to currency fluctuations. We also face risks that extreme economic conditions, political instability, or hostilities or disasters of the type described below could impact or perhaps eliminate the underlying exposures that we are hedging. Such an event could lead to losses being recognized on the currency hedges then in place that are not offset by anticipated changes in the underlying hedge exposure. 
  Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability. 
  We are subject to, and may become a party to, a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving current and former employees, clients, alliance partners, subcontractors, suppliers, competitors, shareholders, government agencies or others through private actions, class actions, whistleblower claims, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. Regardless of the merits of the claims, the cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant, and such matters can be time-consuming and divert management s attention and resources. The results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us. Any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future.

     Table of Contents  

For example, we could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, contribute to internal control deficiencies of a client or otherwise breach obligations to third parties, including clients, alliance partners, employees and former employees, and other parties with whom we conduct business, or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients. We may enter into agreements with non-standard terms because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately follow our contracting guidelines. In addition, the contracting practices of competitors, along with the demands of increasingly sophisticated clients, may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the marketplace. We may find ourselves committed to providing services or solutions that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery will reduce our profitability or cause us financial loss. If we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations and if our potential liability is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements, liability limitations are not enforced or a third party alleges fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent us from relying upon those contractual protections, we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, as we expand our services and solutions into new areas, such as taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients  businesses, which increasingly include the operation of functions and systems that are critical to the core businesses of our clients, we may be exposed to additional operational, regulatory or other risks specific to these new areas, including risks related to data security. A failure of a client s system based on our services or solutions could also subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations.  
  While we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable. Even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance, insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and, if they prevail, the amount of our recovery.  
  Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment.  
  Our clients include national, provincial, state and local governmental entities. Our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following: 
             
    Government entities, particularly in the United States, often reserve the right to audit our contract costs and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices and compliance with government contract requirements. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, routinely audit our contract costs, including allocated indirect costs, for compliance with the Cost Accounting Standards and the Federal Acquisition Regulation. These agencies also conduct reviews and investigations and make inquiries regarding our accounting and other systems in connection with our performance and business practices with respect to our government contracts. Negative findings from existing and future audits, investigations or inquiries could affect our future sales and profitability by preventing us, by operation of law or in practice, from receiving new government contracts for some period of time. In addition, if the U.S. government concludes that certain costs are not reimbursable, have not been properly determined or are based on outdated estimates of our work, then we will not be allowed to bill for such costs, may have to refund money that has already been paid to us or could be required to retroactively and prospectively adjust previously agreed to billing or pricing rates for our work. Negative findings from existing and future audits of our business systems, including our accounting system, may result in the U.S. government preventing us from billing, at least temporarily, a percentage of our costs. As a result of prior negative findings in connection with audits, investigations and inquiries, we have from time to time experienced some of the adverse consequences described above and may in the future experience further adverse consequences, which could materially adversely affect our future results of operations. 
                
    If a government client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations, we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties, including those under the civil U.S. False Claims Act, and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government. The inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities.  
                
    U.S. government contracting regulations impose strict compliance and disclosure obligations. Disclosure is required if certain company personnel have knowledge of  credible evidence  of a violation of federal criminal laws involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery or improper gratuity, a violation of the civil U.S. False Claims Act or receipt of a significant overpayment from the government. Failure to make required disclosures could be a basis for suspension and/or debarment from federal government contracting in addition to breach of the specific contract and could also impact contracting beyond the U.S. federal level. Reported matters also could lead to audits or investigations and other civil, criminal or administrative sanctions.

Government contracts are subject to heightened reputational and contractual risks compared to contracts with commercial clients. For example, government contracts and the proceedings surrounding them are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity. Negative publicity, including an allegation of improper or illegal activity, regardless of its accuracy, may adversely affect our reputation.  
                
    Terms and conditions of government contracts also tend to be more onerous and are often more difficult to negotiate. For example, these contracts often contain high or unlimited liability for breaches and feature less favorable payment terms and sometimes require us to take on liability for the performance of third parties. 
                
    Government entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies. While these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding and/or at their convenience. Changes in government or political developments, including budget deficits, shortfalls or uncertainties, government spending reductions or other debt constraints could result in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination. Furthermore, if insufficient funding is appropriated to the government entity to cover termination costs, we may not be able to fully recover our investments.  
                
    Political and economic factors such as pending elections, the outcome of recent elections, changes in leadership among key executive or legislative decision makers, revisions to governmental tax or other policies and reduced tax revenues can affect the number and terms of new government contracts signed or the speed at which new contracts are signed, decrease future levels of spending and authorizations for programs that we bid, shift spending priorities to programs in areas for which we do not provide services and/or lead to changes in enforcement or how compliance with relevant rules or laws is assessed. 
                
    Legislative and executive proposals remain under consideration or could be proposed in the future, which, if enacted, could limit or even prohibit our eligibility to be awarded state or federal government contracts in the United States in the future or could include requirements that would otherwise affect our results of operations. Various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced and/or enacted in recent years that deny government contracts to certain U.S. companies that reincorporate or have reincorporated outside the United States. While Accenture was not a U.S. company that reincorporated outside the United States, it is possible that these contract bans and other legislative proposals could be applied in a way that negatively affects Accenture.  
     The occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved, but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients, and could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations.  
  We might not be successful at identifying, acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses.  
  We expect to continue pursuing strategic and targeted acquisitions, investments and joint ventures to enhance or add to our skills and capabilities or offerings of services and solutions, or to enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets. Depending on the opportunities available, we may increase the amount of capital invested in such opportunities. We may not successfully identify suitable investment opportunities. We also might not succeed in completing targeted transactions or achieve desired results of operations. Furthermore, we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we might acquire or create through a joint venture. Ongoing business may be disrupted, and our management s attention may be diverted by acquisition, investment, transition or integration activities. In addition, we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources, and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations. Acquisitions or joint ventures may result in significant costs and expenses, including those related to retention payments, equity compensation, severance pay, early retirement costs, intangible asset amortization and asset impairment charges, assumed litigation and other liabilities, and legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, which could negatively affect our profitability. We may have difficulties as a result of entering into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions. 
  We might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition, investment or joint venture we undertake. We might not achieve our expected return on investment or may lose money. We may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from a company we acquire or in which we invest, including from that company s known and unknown obligations, intellectual property or other assets, terminated employees, current or former clients or other third parties. In addition, we may fail to identify or adequately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring, investing in or partnering with a company, including potential  
  
   16 

     Table of Contents  

exposure to regulatory sanctions or liabilities resulting from an acquisition target s previous activities. If any of these circumstances occurs, they could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business. In addition, we have a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint ventures and businesses in which we have made minority investments. This lesser degree of control may expose us to additional reputational, financial, legal, compliance or operational risks. Litigation, indemnification claims and other unforeseen claims and liabilities may arise from the acquisition or operation of acquired businesses. For example, we may face litigation or other claims as a result of certain terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement, such as earnout payments or closing net asset adjustments. Alternatively, shareholder litigation may arise as a result of proposed acquisitions. If we are unable to complete the number and kind of investments for which we plan, or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations, we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share, profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services. 
  We periodically evaluate, and have engaged in, the disposition of assets and businesses. Divestitures could involve difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, the diversion of management s attention, the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees. After reaching an agreement with a buyer for the disposition of a business, the transaction may be subject to the satisfaction of pre-closing conditions as well as to obtaining necessary regulatory and government approvals, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the transaction. Divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested assets and businesses, such as indemnities or other financial obligations, in which the performance of the divested assets or businesses could impact our results of operations. Any divestiture we undertake could adversely affect our results of operations. 
  Our Global Delivery Network is increasingly concentrated in India and the Philippines, which may expose us to operational risks.  
  Our business model is dependent on our Global Delivery Network, which includes Accenture personnel based at more than 50 delivery centers around the world. While these delivery centers are located throughout the world, we have based large portions of our delivery network in India, where we have the largest number of people in our delivery network located, and the Philippines, where we have the second largest number of people located. Concentrating our Global Delivery Network in these locations presents a number of operational risks, many of which are beyond our control. For example, natural disasters of the type described below, some of which India and the Philippines have experienced and other countries may experience, could impair the ability of our people to safely travel to and work in our facilities and disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers. Additionally, both India and the Philippines have experienced, and other countries may experience, political instability, worker strikes, civil unrest and hostilities with neighboring countries. Military activity or civil hostilities in the future, as well as terrorist activities and other conditions, which are described more fully below, could significantly disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers. Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective, particularly if catastrophic events occur. If any of these circumstances occurs, we have a greater risk that the interruptions in communications with our clients and other Accenture locations and personnel, and any down-time in important processes we operate for clients, could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation in the marketplace.  
  As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, we are more susceptible to certain risks.  
  We have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 55 countries around the world. One aspect of our growth strategy is to continue to expand in key markets around the world. Our growth strategy might not be successful. If we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations and geographic expansion strategy, including international hostilities, terrorist activities, natural disasters, security breaches, failure to maintain compliance with our clients  control requirements and multiple legal and regulatory systems, our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected. In addition, emerging markets generally involve greater financial and operational risks, such as those described below, than our more mature markets. Negative or uncertain political climates in countries or geographies where we operate could also adversely affect us.  
  International hostilities, terrorist activities, natural disasters, pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus adversely affect our results of operations.   Acts of terrorist violence; political unrest; armed regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities; natural disasters, volcanic eruptions, floods and other severe weather conditions; health emergencies or pandemics or the threat of or perceived potential for these events; and other acts of god could have a negative impact on us. These events could adversely affect our clients  levels of business activity and precipitate sudden and significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles. These events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world, whether the facilities are ours or those of our alliance partners  
  
   17 

     Table of Contents  

or clients. By disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel, these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services and solutions to our clients. Extended disruptions of electricity, other public utilities or network services at our facilities, as well as system failures at, or security breaches in, our facilities or systems, could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients. We might be unable to protect our people, facilities and systems against all such occurrences. We generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks, conflicts and wars. If these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients, our results of operations could be adversely affected. 
  We could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies.   In some countries, we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies, which would limit our ability to use this cash across our global operations and expose us to more extreme currency fluctuations. This risk could increase as we continue our geographic expansion in key markets around the world, which include emerging markets that are more likely to impose these restrictions than more established markets.  
  Our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violation of these regulations could harm our business.   We are subject to numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes on matters as diverse as anticorruption, import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, immigration, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation, anti-competition, anti-money-laundering, data privacy and protection, wage-and-hour standards, and employment and labor relations. The global nature of our operations, including emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or understood by us, and the diverse nature of our operations across a number of regulated industries, further increase the difficulty of compliance. Compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly, time-consuming and requires significant resources. Violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines, criminal sanctions against us and/or our employees, prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation. Violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for significant monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage and restrictions on our ability to effectively carry out our contractual obligations and thereby expose us to potential claims from our clients. Due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate, local laws may not be well developed or provide sufficiently clear guidance and may be insufficient to protect our rights.  
  In particular, in many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate and/or seek to expand, practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws, or regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act 2010. Our employees, subcontractors, vendors, agents, alliance or joint venture partners, the companies we acquire and their employees, subcontractors, vendors and agents, and other third parties with which we associate, could take actions that violate policies or procedures designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations. Violations of these laws or regulations by us, our employees or any of these third parties could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions (whether or not we participated or knew about the actions leading to the violations), including fines or penalties, disgorgement of profits and suspension or disqualification from work, including U.S. federal contracting, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, including our results of operations and our reputation.  
  Changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions. For example, changes in laws and regulations to limit using off-shore resources in connection with our work or to penalize companies that use off-shore resources, which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions, could adversely affect our results of operations. Such changes may result in contracts being terminated or work being transferred on-shore, resulting in greater costs to us. In addition, these changes could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government clients.  
  Adverse changes to our relationships with key alliance partners or in the business of our key alliance partners could adversely affect our results of operations.  
  We have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own. A very significant portion of our services and solutions are based on technology or software provided by a few major providers that are our alliance partners. See  Business Alliances.  The priorities and objectives of our alliance partners may differ from ours. As most of our alliance relationships are non-exclusive, our alliance partners are not prohibited from competing with us or forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors. One or more of our key alliance partners may be acquired by a competitor, or key alliance partners might merge with each other, either of which could reduce our access over time to the technology or software provided by those partners. In addition, our alliance partners could experience reduced demand for their technology or software, including, for example, in response to changes in technology, which  
  
   18 

     Table of Contents  

could lessen related demand for our services and solutions. If we do not obtain the expected benefits from our alliance relationships for any reason, we may be less competitive, our ability to offer attractive solutions to our clients may be negatively affected, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.  
  Our services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we might lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others.  
  We cannot be sure that our services and solutions, including, for example, our software solutions, or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients, do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. These claims could harm our reputation, cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future. Any related proceedings could require us to expend significant resources over an extended period of time. In most of our contracts, we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties. In some instances, the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client. Any claims or litigation in this area could be time-consuming and costly, damage our reputation and/or require us to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to our clients. If we cannot secure this right at all or on reasonable terms, or we cannot substitute alternative technology, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The risk of infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our industry software solutions and continue to develop and license our software to multiple clients.       Additionally, in recent years, individuals and firms have purchased intellectual property assets in order to assert claims of infringement against technology providers and customers that use such technology. Any such action naming us or our clients could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us. Moreover, such an action could result in an injunction being ordered against our client or our own services or operations, causing further damages.  
  In addition, we rely on third-party software in providing some of our services and solutions. If we lose our ability to continue using such software for any reason, including because it is found to infringe the rights of others, we will need to obtain substitute software or seek alternative means of obtaining the technology necessary to continue to provide such services and solutions. Our inability to replace such software, or to replace such software in a timely or cost-effective manner, could materially adversely affect our results of operations. 
  If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties, our business could be adversely affected.  
  Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property. Existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights, and the protection in some countries may be very limited. We rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, and patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. These laws are subject to change at any time and could further limit our ability to protect our intellectual property. There is uncertainty concerning the scope of available intellectual property protection for software and business methods, which are fields in which we rely on intellectual property laws to protect our rights. Our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from reverse engineering our proprietary information or independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative of ours. Further, the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former employees or other third parties, and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Enforcing our rights might also require considerable time, money and oversight, and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights.  
  Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace.  
  We believe the Accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services and solutions from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees. However, our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients, cybersecurity breaches or service outages, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures, compliance violations, government investigations or legal proceedings. Similarly, our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients, directors, employees, competitors, vendors, alliance partners, our joint ventures or joint venture partners, adversaries in legal proceedings, legislators or government regulators, as well as members of the investment community or the media. There is a risk that negative information about Accenture, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could adversely affect our business. Damage to our reputation could be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to repair, could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements, resulting in a loss of business, and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts. Damage  
  
   19 

     Table of Contents  

to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the Accenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us, materially adversely affecting our share price.  
  If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives.  
  As of August 31, 2016, we had approximately 384,000 employees worldwide. Our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges. It might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge. It might also become more difficult to maintain our culture, effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operations and effectively communicate our core values, policies and procedures, strategies and goals, particularly given our world-wide operations. The size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity, or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks, despite our efforts to train them and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances. For example, employee misconduct could involve the improper use of our clients  sensitive or confidential information or the failure to comply with legislation or regulations regarding the protection of sensitive or confidential information. Furthermore, the inappropriate use of social networking sites by our employees could result in breaches of confidentiality, unauthorized disclosure of non-public company information or damage to our reputation. If we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all of our employees, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired. In addition, from time to time, we have made, and may continue to make, changes to our operating model, including how we are organized, as the needs and size of our business change, and if we do not successfully implement the changes, our business and results of operation may be negatively impacted. 
  We make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our financial results. 
  Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The application of generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that affect our reported financial condition, and our accompanying disclosure with respect to, among other things, revenue recognition and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience, contractual commitments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment and are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. If our estimates, or the assumptions underlying such estimates, are not correct, actual results may differ materially from our estimates, and we may need to, among other things, adjust revenues or accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations.  
  Many of our contracts include payments that link some of our fees to the attainment of performance or business targets and/or require us to meet specific service levels. This could increase the variability of our revenues and impact our margins.  
  Many of our contracts include clauses that tie our compensation to the achievement of agreed-upon performance standards or milestones. If we fail to satisfy these measures, it could significantly reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts, increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones, delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms. Clients also often have the right to terminate a contract and pursue damage claims under the contract for serious or repeated failure to meet these service commitments. We also have a number of contracts in which a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as cost-savings, revenue enhancement, benefits produced, business goals attained and adherence to schedule. These goals can be complex and may depend on our clients  actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate. These provisions could increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts.  
  Our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls.  
  The accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. We are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls. Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud. Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. If we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we could suffer harm to our reputation, incur

incremental compliance costs, fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis, be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements, and our results of operations, our share price and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected.  
  We are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States. We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland.  
  We are organized under the laws of Ireland, and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States. A shareholder who obtains a court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws may be unable to enforce the judgment against us in Ireland or in countries other than the United States where we have assets. In addition, there is some doubt as to whether the courts of Ireland and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the United States and Ireland do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. The laws of Ireland do, however, as a general rule, provide that the judgments of the courts of the United States have the same validity in Ireland as if rendered by Irish Courts. Certain important requirements must be satisfied before the Irish Courts will recognize a U.S. judgment. The originating court must have been a court of competent jurisdiction, the judgment must be final and conclusive and the judgment may not be recognized if it was obtained by fraud or its recognition would be contrary to Irish public policy. Any judgment obtained in contravention of the rules of natural justice or that is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment would not be enforced in Ireland. Similarly, judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the United States where we have assets.  
  Some companies that conduct substantial business in the United States but which have a parent domiciled in certain other jurisdictions have been criticized as improperly avoiding U.S. taxes or creating an unfair competitive advantage over other U.S. companies. Accenture never conducted business under a U.S. parent company and pays U.S. taxes on all of its U.S. operations. Nonetheless, we could be subject to criticism in connection with our incorporation in Ireland.  
  Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders.  
  Our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States. As an Irish company, we are governed by the Companies Act. The Companies Act differs in some significant, and possibly material, respects from laws applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders under various state corporation laws, including the provisions relating to interested directors, mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors.  
  Under Irish law, the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company under Irish law, and may only do so in limited circumstances. Directors of an Irish company must, in exercising their powers and performing their duties, act with due care and skill, honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company. Directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries. If a director or officer of an Irish company is found to have breached his duties to that company, he could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty.  
  Under Irish law, we must have authority from our shareholders to issue any shares, including shares that are part of the company s authorized but unissued share capital. In addition, unless otherwise authorized by its shareholders, when an Irish company issues shares for cash to new shareholders, it is required first to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to existing shareholders on a pro-rata basis. If we are unable to obtain these authorizations from our shareholders, or are otherwise limited by the terms of our authorizations, our ability to issue shares under our equity compensation plans and, if applicable, to facilitate funding acquisitions or otherwise raise capital could be adversely affected. 
  We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all. If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders  ownership interest in us.  
  We might choose to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to:  
             
    take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion;  
     
   21

    repurchase shares from our shareholders;  
                
    develop new services and solutions; or  
                
    respond to competitive pressures.  
     Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute shareholders  ownership percentage in us. Furthermore, any additional financing we need might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.

  In certain circumstances, as an Irish tax resident company, we may be required to deduct Irish dividend withholding tax ( DWT ) (currently at the rate of 20%) from dividends paid to our shareholders. Shareholders resident in  relevant territories  (including countries that are European Union member states (other than Ireland), the United States and other countries with which Ireland has a tax treaty) may be exempted from Irish DWT.

ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS 
  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in  Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  and  Risk Factors  in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  We use the terms  Accenture,   we,  the  Company,   our  and  us  in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to  fiscal   2016    means the 12-month period that ended on   August 31, 2016  . All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. 
  We use the term  in local currency  so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results  in local currency  are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. 
   
  Overview    
  Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients  current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis.    
  Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which may impact our business. We continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions. There also continues to be significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our net revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro and the U.K. pound. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a material effect on our financial results.    
  Revenues before reimbursements ( net revenues ) for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2016   increased   8%   in U.S. dollars and   9%   in local currency compared to the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  . Net revenues for   fiscal 2016   increased   6%   in U.S. dollars and   10%   in local currency compared to   fiscal 2015  . Demand for our services and solutions continued to be strong, resulting in growth across all areas of our business. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, revenue growth in local currency was significant in Products and strong in Health   Public Service and Financial Services. Communications, Media   Technology revenue growth in local currency was solid, while Resources was flat. Revenue growth in local currency was very strong in consulting and solid in outsourcing during the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  . While the business environment remained competitive, we experienced pricing improvement in several areas of our business in fiscal 2016. We use the term  pricing  to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell.    
  In our consulting business, net revenues for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2016   increased   11%   in U.S. dollars and   13%   in local currency compared to the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  . Net consulting revenues for   fiscal 2016   increased   10%   in U.S. dollars and   15%   in local currency compared to   fiscal 2015  . Consulting revenue growth in local currency in the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2016   was led by very significant growth in Products, as well as strong growth in Financial Services, Health   Public Service and Communications, Media   Technology, while Resources had a slight decline  . We continue to experience growing demand for digital-related services and assisting clients with the adoption of new technologies. In addition, clients continued to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses. Compared to   fiscal 2015  , we continued to provide a greater proportion of systems integration consulting through use of lower cost resources in our Global Delivery Network. This trend has resulted in work volume growing faster than revenue in our systems integration business, and we expect this trend to continue. 
  In our outsourcing business, net revenues for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2016   increased   4%   in U.S. dollars and   6%   in local currency compared to the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  . Net outsourcing revenues for   fiscal 2016   increased   1%   in U.S. dollars and   6%   in local currency compared to   fiscal 2015  . Outsourcing revenue growth in local currency in the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2016   was driven by very strong growth in Health   Public Service as well as solid growth in Products and Financial Services  . We are experiencing growing demand to assist clients with cloud enablement and the operation and maintenance of digital-related services. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming

their operations to improve effectiveness and save costs. Compared to   fiscal 2015  , we continued to provide a greater proportion of application outsourcing through use of lower-cost resources in our Global Delivery Network. 
  As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. When compared to the same periods in   fiscal 2015  , the U.S. dollar strengthened against many currencies during the fourth quarter and   fiscal year ended August 31, 2016  , resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately     2%   and   5%   lower, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for fiscal 2017, we estimate that our full fiscal 2017 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately equal to our revenue growth in local currency.    
  The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems and office space.    
  Utilization for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2016   was   92%  , up from   91%   in the   third quarter of fiscal 2016   and   90%     in the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  . We continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand.   We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Based on current and projected future demand, we have increased our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, to approximately   384,000   as of   August 31, 2016  , compared to approximately   358,000   as of   August 31, 2015  . The year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions. Annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2016   was   16%  , up from   15%   in the   third quarter of fiscal 2016   and   14%   in the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  . We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases for fiscal 2016 became effective December 1, 2015. We strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin. Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees.    
  Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of Net revenues) for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2016   was   31.3%  , compared with   31.7%   for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  . Gross margin for   fiscal 2016   was   31.3%  , compared with   31.6%   for   fiscal 2015  . The reduction in gross margin for   fiscal 2016   was principally due to higher labor costs and higher costs associated with acquisition activities compared to   fiscal 2015  .  
  Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were   17.2%   for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  , compared with   17.9%   for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  . Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were   16.6%   for   fiscal 2016  , compared with   17.1%   for   fiscal 2015  . We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate. For   fiscal 2016   compared to   fiscal 2015  , Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased   40   basis points principally due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities, and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased   10   basis points. 
  Operating expenses in   fiscal 2015   included a Pension settlement charge of   $64 million   related to lump sum cash payments made from our U.S. defined benefit pension plan to former employees who elected to receive such payments. For additional information, see Note   10   (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to our Consolidated Financial Statements   under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.     
  Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Net revenues) for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2016   was     14.1%  , compared with   13.9%   for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  . Operating margin for   fiscal 2016   was   14.6%  , compared with   14.3%   for   fiscal 2015  . The Pension settlement charge of   $64 million   recorded in   fiscal 2015   decreased operating

margin by   20   basis points for   fiscal 2015  . Excluding the effect of the Pension settlement charge, operating margin for   fiscal 2015   would have been   14.5%  .    
  During   fiscal 2016  , we recorded a   $548 million   gain on sale of business and   $56 million   in taxes related to the divestiture of our Navitaire business, as well as a   $301 million   gain on sale of business and   $48 million   in taxes related to the partial divestiture of our Duck Creek business. For additional information, see Note   5   (Business Combinations and Divestitures) to our Consolidated Financial Statements   under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.   
  The effective tax rate for   fiscal 2016   was   22.4%  , compared with   25.8%   for   fiscal 2015  . Absent the   $849 million     Gain on sale of businesses and related   $104 million   in taxes recorded during   fiscal 2016  , our effective tax rate for   fiscal 2016   would have been   24.2%  . Absent the   $64 million   Pension settlement charge and related $25 million in taxes recorded during   fiscal 2015  , our effective tax rate for   fiscal 2015   would have been   26.0%  . 
  Diluted earnings per share were   $6.45   for   fiscal 2016  , compared with   $4.76   for   fiscal 2015  . The Gain on sale of businesses, net of taxes, recorded during   fiscal 2016   increased Diluted earnings per share by   $1.11   in   fiscal 2016  . The Pension settlement charge, net of taxes, recorded during   fiscal 2015   decreased Diluted earnings per share by   $0.06   in   fiscal 2015  . Excluding these impacts, Diluted earnings per share would have been   $5.34   and   $4.82   for   fiscal 2016   and   2015  , respectively.    
  We have presented Operating income, operating margin, effective tax rate and Diluted earnings per share excluding the impacts of the fiscal 2016 Gain on sale of businesses and the fiscal 2015 Pension settlement charge, as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to both the impacts of these items and our operating performance in comparison to the prior period.    
  Our Operating income   and Diluted earnings per share are   affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues and costs. Most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues. Where practical, we seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues, such as the cost of our Global Delivery Network, by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs. We seek to manage our costs, taking into consideration the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on those costs. For more information on our hedging programs, see Note   7   (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements   under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.     
   
  Bookings and Backlog    
  New bookings for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2016   were   $8.99 billion  , with consulting bookings of   $4.81 billion     and outsourcing bookings of   $4.18 billion  . New bookings for   fiscal 2016   were   $35.39 billion  , with consulting bookings of   $19.16 billion   and outsourcing bookings of   $16.23 billion  . 
  We provide information regarding our new bookings, which include new contracts, including those acquired through acquisitions, as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts, because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. New bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts. The types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues. For example, outsourcing bookings, which are typically for multi-year contracts, generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings. Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. New bookings involve estimates and judgments. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.    
  The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice, and some without notice. Accordingly, we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog. Normally, if a client terminates a project, the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project, services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates    
  The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes.    
  Revenue Recognition    
  Our contracts have different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement, the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues. We have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types. In addition, some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. We conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable.    
  We recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract. Our contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years. Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable. This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified. If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities.    
  Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned. We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In such contracts, our efforts, measured by time incurred, typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered and are earned. Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned.    
  Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries. In a number of these arrangements, we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations. Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned. Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed. In such contracts, our effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients. Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned. We continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability. Circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputs/outputs on which we are paid, failure to deliver agreed benefits, variances from planned internal/external costs to deliver our services and other factors affecting revenues and costs.    
  Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred, with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. The deferred costs are specific internal costs or  
  
   31 

     Table of Contents  

incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. Contract acquisition and origination costs are expensed as incurred.    
  We enter into contracts that may consist of multiple deliverables. These contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services, non-technology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above. Revenues for contracts with multiple deliverables are allocated based on the lesser of the element s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another deliverable. The selling price of each deliverable is determined by obtaining third party evidence of the selling price for the deliverable and is based on the price charged when largely similar services are sold on a standalone basis by the Company to similarly situated customers. If the amount of non-contingent revenues allocated to a deliverable accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent. Revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate deliverables when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, selling price of the separate deliverables exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the completed deliverable, performance of the in-process deliverable is considered probable and substantially in our control. While determining fair value and identifying separate deliverables require judgment, generally fair value and the separate deliverables are readily identifiable as we also sell those deliverables unaccompanied by other deliverables.    
  Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services. Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met. Client prepayments (even if nonrefundable) are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed.    
  Our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in a fiscal quarter, which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays. Consequently, since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 5-10% more work days than our second and fourth quarters, our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters.    
  Net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware, software and related services resale contracts, as well as revenues from alliance agreements, neither of which is material to us. Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware, software and related services resales. In addition, Reimbursements include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses. We report revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions.    
  Income Taxes    
  Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities. As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly. Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate.    
  We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) guidance on uncertainty in income taxes, a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs. In the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs.

     Table of Contents  

No taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate.     During fiscal 2015, the Company distributed substantially all of the earnings of its U.S. subsidiaries that were previously considered indefinitely reinvested and recorded a tax liability of $247 million for withholding taxes payable on this distribution.   We currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute any remaining undistributed earnings.   For additional information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  
  As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions.    
   
  Revenues by Segment/Operating Group    
  Our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups, which are Communications, Media   Technology; Financial Services; Health   Public Service; Products; and Resources. Operating groups are managed on the basis of net revenues because our management believes net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues. In addition to reporting net revenues by operating group, we also report net revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our operating groups. Consulting net revenues, which include management and technology consulting and systems integration, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables. Outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions.    
  From time to time, our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts. The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups. Generally, operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees. The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups. Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses.    
  While we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume. Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume. Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements. Revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and the outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors.

  Our business in the United States represented   46%  ,   43%   and   40%   of our consolidated net revenues during fiscal     2016, 2015 and 2014  , respectively. No other country individually comprised 10% or more of our consolidated net revenues during these periods.    
  Net Revenues    
  The following net revenues commentary discusses local currency net revenue changes for   fiscal 2016   compared to   fiscal 2015  : 
  Operating Groups    
             
    Communications, Media   Technology net revenues increased   9%   in local currency. Net revenues reflected strong growth, driven by growth across all industry groups in North America and Growth Markets, as well as Media   Entertainment in Europe. 
                
    Financial Services net revenues increased   11%   in local currency. Net revenues reflected very strong growth, driven by growth in both industry groups across all geographic regions, led by Banking   Capital Markets in Europe. 
                
    Health   Public Service net revenues increased   12%   in local currency. Net revenues reflected very strong growth, driven by growth in both industry groups across all geographic regions, led by Public Service and Health in North America. 
                
    Products net revenues increased   15%   in local currency. Net revenues reflected very strong growth, driven by growth across all industry groups and geographic regions, led by Consumer Goods, Retail   Travel Services, as well as Industrial in Europe and Life Sciences in North America.

     Table of Contents  

Resources net revenues increased   3%   in local currency. Net revenues reflected modest growth, as significant growth in Utilities across all geographic regions was largely offset by declines in Chemicals   Natural Resources in Growth Markets and North America and Energy in Europe and Growth Markets. We have experienced lower or negative revenue growth in Chemicals   Natural Resources and Energy, principally due to economic challenges in these industries, and we expect this trend to continue in the near term. 
     Geographic Regions    
             
    North America net revenues increased   11%   in local currency, driven by the United States. 
                
    Europe net revenues increased   11%   in local currency, driven by the United Kingdom, Italy, Switzerland, Spain, Germany and France. 
                
    Growth Markets net revenues increased   8%   in local currency, led by Japan, as well as China, India, South Africa and Mexico. 
     Operating Expenses    
  Operating expenses for   fiscal 2016   increased   $1,509 million  , or   5%  , over   fiscal 2015  , and decreased as a percentage of revenues to   86.2%   from   86.5%   during this period  . Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for     fiscal 2016   increased   $1,460 million  , or   5%  , over   fiscal 2015  , and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to   85.4%   from   85.7%   during this period. 
  Cost of Services    
  Cost of services for   fiscal 2016   increased   $1,415 million  , or   6%  , over   fiscal 2015  , and increased as a percentage of revenues to   70.5%   from   70.2%   during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for   fiscal 2016     increased   $1,367 million  , or   6%  , over   fiscal 2015  , and increased as a percentage of net revenues to   68.7%   from   68.4%     during this period. Gross margin for   fiscal 2016   decreased to   31.3%   from   31.6%   in fiscal 2015. The reduction in gross margin for   fiscal 2016   was principally due to higher labor costs and higher costs associated with acquisition activities compared to   fiscal 2015  .    
  Sales and Marketing    
  Sales and marketing expense for   fiscal 2016   increased   $75 million  , or   2%  , over   fiscal 2015  , and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to   10.9%   from   11.3%   during this period. The decrease as a percentage of net revenues was principally due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities.    
  General and Administrative Costs    
  General and administrative costs for   fiscal 2016   increased   $83 million  , or   5%  , over   fiscal 2015  , and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to   5.7%   from   5.8%   during this period.    
  Pension Settlement Charge    
  We recorded a Pension settlement charge of   $64 million   during   fiscal 2015   as a result of lump sum cash payments made from our U.S. defined benefit pension plan to former employees who elected to receive such payments. For additional information, see Note   10   (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to our Consolidated Financial Statements   under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Operating Income and Operating Margin 
  Operating income for   fiscal 2016   increased   $375 million  , or   8%  , over   fiscal 2015  . During   fiscal 2015  , we recorded a Pension settlement charge of   $64 million  , which decreased operating margin by   20   basis points. Excluding the effect of the fiscal 2015 Pension settlement charge, operating margin for   fiscal 2016   increased   10   basis points compared with   fiscal 2015  . 
     Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows:

    Represents Pension settlement charge related to lump sum cash payment from plan assets offered to eligible former employees.    
     We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our Operating income during   fiscal 2016   was similar to that disclosed for Net revenue. In addition, during   fiscal 2016  , each operating group experienced higher costs associated with acquisition activity.   The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for   fiscal 2016   compared with   fiscal 2015  , exclusive of the Pension settlement charge recorded in   fiscal 2015  :    
             
    Communications, Media   Technology operating income increased primarily due to higher contract profitability and consulting revenue growth. 
                
    Financial Services operating income increased primarily due to consulting revenue growth. 
                
    Health   Public Service operating income increased due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability.

Products operating income increased due to very significant consulting revenue growth and lower sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues. 
                
    Resources operating income decreased due to lower outsourcing contract profitability, partially offset by lower sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues. 
     Other Expense, net    
  Other expense, net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses as well as gains and losses associated with our investments in privately held companies. During   fiscal 2016  , Other expense, net increased   $25 million   over   fiscal 2015  , primarily due to higher net foreign exchange losses, including losses incurred on the devaluation of the Nigerian Naira.    
  Gain on Sale of Business  es  
  We recorded a gain from the Navitaire divestiture of   $548 million   and a gain from the Duck Creek partial divestiture of   $301 million   during   fiscal 2016  . For additional information, see Note   5   (Business Combinations and Divestitures) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under   Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.     
  Provision for Income Taxes    
  The effective tax rate for   fiscal 2016   was   22.4%  , compared with   25.8%   for   fiscal 2015  . Absent the   $849 million   Gain on sale of businesses and related   $104 million   in taxes recorded during   fiscal 2016  , the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 would have been   24.2%  . Absent the   $64 million   Pension settlement charge and related $25 million in taxes recorded during   fiscal 2015  , the effective tax rate for   fiscal 2015   would have been   26.0%  . The effective tax rate for   fiscal 2016   benefited from a final determination of U.S. Federal taxes for fiscal 2012. The effective tax rate for   fiscal 2015   benefited from a final determination of U.S. Federal taxes for fiscal years 2010 and 2011. This was offset by expenses associated with an increase in deferred tax liabilities during   fiscal 2015  , when we concluded that certain undistributed earnings of our U.S. subsidiaries would no longer be considered indefinitely reinvested. For additional information, see Note   9   (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.     
  Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries. See  Business Organizational Structure.  Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc. Since January 2002, noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary. 
  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for   fiscal 2016   increased   $18 million  , or   8%  , over   fiscal 2015  . The increase was due to higher Net income of   $1,076 million  , primarily driven by the Gain on sale of businesses, partially offset by a reduction in the Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest during fiscal 2016.  
  Earnings Per Share 
  Diluted earnings per share were   $6.45   for   fiscal 2016  , compared with   $4.76   for   fiscal 2015  . The   $1.69   increase in our Diluted earnings per share included the impact of the Gain on sale of businesses, net of taxes, which increased Diluted earnings per share for   fiscal 2016   by   $1.11   and the impact of the Pension settlement charge, net of taxes, which decreased Diluted earnings per share for   fiscal 2015   by   $0.06  . Excluding these impacts, Diluted earnings per share for   fiscal 2016   increased   $0.52   compared with   fiscal 2015  , due to increases of   $0.34   from higher revenues and operating results,   $0.13   from a lower effective tax rate and   $0.08   from lower weighted average shares outstanding. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of   $0.03   from higher non-operating expense. For information regarding our Earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

    Effective September 1, 2014, we revised the reporting of our geographic regions as follows: North America (the United States and Canada); Europe; and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Russia and Turkey). Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 
     Net Revenues 
  The following net revenues commentary discusses local currency net revenue changes for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014: 
  Operating Groups 
             
    Communications, Media   Technology net revenues increased 16% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected significant growth, driven by growth across all industry groups and geographic regions, led by Communications in all geographic regions as well as Media   Entertainment in North America. Consulting revenues reflected significant growth, driven by growth across all industry groups and geographic regions, led by Communications in North America and Growth Markets. 
                
    Financial Services net revenues increased 11% in local currency. Consulting revenues reflected significant growth, driven by growth across both industry groups and all geographic regions, led by Banking   Capital Markets in Europe. Outsourcing revenue growth was driven by Banking   Capital Markets and Insurance in Europe and Banking   Capital Markets in Growth Markets. These outsourcing increases were partially offset by a decline in Banking   Capital Markets in North America.

     Table of Contents  

Health   Public Service net revenues increased 12% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected very significant growth, led by Health and Public Service in North America. Consulting revenue growth was driven by Health and Public Service in North America. 
                
    Products net revenues increased 10% in local currency. Consulting revenues reflected very strong growth, driven by growth across all industry groups and geographic regions, led by Consumer Goods, Retail   Travel Services and Industrial in Europe. Outsourcing revenues reflected strong growth, driven by all geographic regions and in most industry groups, led by Consumer Goods, Retail   Travel Services. These outsourcing increases were partially offset by a decline in Industrial in Europe. 
                
    Resources net revenues increased 5% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected strong growth, driven by Utilities across all geographic regions, Chemicals   Natural Resources in Growth Markets and Energy in Europe. Consulting revenues reflected slight growth, driven by Utilities across all geographic regions and Chemicals   Natural Resources in Europe. These consulting increases were largely offset by declines in Energy in Europe and North America and Chemicals   Natural Resources in Growth Markets. 
     Geographic Regions 
             
    North America net revenues increased 12% in local currency, driven by the United States. 
                
    Europe net revenues increased 10% in local currency, driven by Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, the Netherlands, Italy and France. 
                
    Growth Markets net revenues increased 11% in local currency, driven by Japan, Brazil and Australia, partially offset by declines in South Korea and Singapore. 
     Operating Expenses 
  Operating expenses for fiscal 2015 increased $904 million, or 3%, over fiscal 2014, and remained flat as a percentage of revenues at 86.5%, compared with fiscal 2014. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2015 increased $910 million, or 4%, over fiscal 2014, and remained flat as a percentage of net revenues at 85.7%, compared with fiscal 2014. 
  Cost of Services 
  Cost of services for fiscal 2015 increased $915 million, or 4%, over fiscal 2014, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 70.2% from 69.6% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2015 increased $921 million, or 5%, over fiscal 2014, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 68.4% from 67.7% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2015 decreased to 31.6% from 32.3% in fiscal 2014, principally due to higher labor costs, increased usage of subcontractors and higher non-payroll costs including recruiting and training costs from the addition of a larger number of employees compared to fiscal 2014. 
  Sales and Marketing 
  Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2015 decreased $78 million, or 2%, from fiscal 2014, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 11.3% from 11.9% during this period. The decrease as a percentage of net revenues was principally due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities.  
  General and Administrative Costs 
  General and administrative costs for fiscal 2015 decreased $15 million, or 1%, from fiscal 2014, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 5.8% from 6.1% during this period.  
  Pension Settlement Charge 
  We recorded a Pension settlement charge of $64 million, pre-tax, during fiscal 2015 as a result of lump sum cash payments made from our U.S. defined benefit pension plan to former employees who elected to receive such payments. For additional information, refer to Note 10 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Operating Income and Operating Margin 
  Operating income for fiscal 2015 increased $135 million, or 3%, from fiscal 2014. The Pension settlement charge of $64 million recorded in fiscal 2015 decreased operating margin by 20 basis points. Excluding the effects of the Pension settlement charge, operating margin for fiscal 2015 increased 20 basis points compared with fiscal 2014. 
   Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows:

     We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our Operating income during fiscal 2015 was similar to that disclosed for Net revenue. In addition, during fiscal 2015, each operating group recorded a portion of the $64 million Pension settlement charge. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2015, exclusive of the Pension settlement charge, compared with fiscal 2014:  
             
    Communications, Media   Technology operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and lower sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues. 
                
    Financial Services operating income increased primarily due to consulting revenue growth, lower sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues and higher contract profitability. 
                
    Health   Public Service operating income increased due to outsourcing revenue growth. 
                
    Products operating income increased due to higher contract profitability and consulting revenue growth.

Resources operating income decreased due to lower contract profitability. 
     Other Expense, net 
  Other expense, net for fiscal 2015 increased $29 million over fiscal 2014, primarily due to higher net foreign exchange losses, including losses incurred on the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar Fuerte. 
  Provision for Income Taxes 
  The effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was 25.8%, compared with 26.1% for fiscal 2014. Absent the tax impact of the $64 million Pension settlement charge recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2015, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 would have been 26.0%. The fiscal 2015 tax rate includes higher benefits related to final determinations of tax liabilities for prior years, including a $170 million benefit related to final settlement of U.S. tax audits for fiscal years 2010 and 2011, and benefits related to changes in the geographic distribution of earnings, offset by an increase in withholding taxes payable on the distribution of U.S. earnings. For additional information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  
  Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries. See  Business Organizational Structure.  Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc. Since January 2002, noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary. 
  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2015 decreased $14 million, or 6%, from fiscal 2014. The decrease was due to a reduction in the Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest, partially offset by higher Net income of $98 million for fiscal 2015.  
  Earnings Per Share 
  Diluted earnings per share were $4.76 for fiscal 2015, compared with $4.52 for fiscal 2014. The $0.24 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of the $64 million Pension settlement charge, which decreased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015 by $0.06. Excluding the impact of this charge, diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015 increased $0.30 compared with fiscal 2014, due to increases of $0.22 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.09 from lower weighted average shares outstanding and $0.01 from a lower effective tax rate. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.02 from lower non-operating income. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Liquidity and Capital Resources    
  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities. In addition, we could raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings. We may use our available or additional funds to, among other things:    
             
    facilitate purchases, redemptions and exchanges of shares and pay dividends;    
                
    acquire complementary businesses or technologies;    
                
    take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion; or    
                
    develop new services and solutions.    
     As of   August 31, 2016  , Cash and cash equivalents were   $4.9 billion  , compared with   $4.4 billion   as of   August 31, 2015  . 
  Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table:    

_______________  
  Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.    
  Operating activities:     The year-over-year increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by revenue growth and higher operating income, as well as higher collections on net client balances (receivables from clients, current and non-current unbilled services and deferred revenues), partially offset by other changes in operating assets and liabilities, including higher spending on certain compensation payments.    
  Investing activities:     Cash used in investing activities decreased   $560 million     year-over-year, as higher spending on business acquisitions, investments and property and equipment was more than offset by proceeds of   $815 million   from the Navitaire divestiture and Duck Creek partial divestiture. For additional information, see Note   5   (Business Combinations and Divestitures) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.     
  Financing activities:     The   $195 million   increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of shares and an increase in cash dividends paid. For additional information, see Note   13   (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders  Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.     
  We believe that our available cash balances and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our current and planned working capital and investment needs for the next twelve months. We also believe that our longer-term working capital and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities.    
  Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future.

    On   December 22, 2015  , we   replaced   our   $1.0 billion   syndicated loan facility maturing on   October 31, 2016   with a   $1.0 billion   syndicated loan facility maturing on   December 22, 2020  . This facility provides unsecured, revolving borrowing capacity for general working capital purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit.   We continue   to be in compliance with relevant covenant terms. The facility is subject to annual commitment fees. As of   August 31, 2016   and   2015  , we   had   no   borrowings under either the current or the prior loan facility. 
              (2) 
    We maintain separate, uncommitted and unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities. These facilities provide local-currency financing for the majority of our operations. Interest rate terms on the revolving facilities are at market rates prevailing in the relevant local markets. As of   August 31, 2016 and 2015  , we had no borrowings under these facilities.    
              (3) 
    We also maintain local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit for those locations that cannot access our global facilities. As of   August 31, 2016 and 2015  , we had no borrowings under these various facilities.    
     Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of   $169 million   and   $167 million   of letters of credit outstanding as of   August 31, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. In addition, we had total outstanding debt of approximately   $27 million   at both   August 31, 2016   and   2015  .    
  Share Purchases and Redemptions    
  The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding   for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and     for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by   current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees.    
  Our share purchase activity during   fiscal 2016   was as follows:    

_______________  
           (1) 
    We conduct a publicly announced open-market share purchase program for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees.    
              (2) 
    During fiscal   2016  , as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs.

     Table of Contents  

We   intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal   2017  . The number of shares ultimately repurchased under   our   open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions,     our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice.    
  Other Share Redemptions    
  During fiscal   2016  , we   issued   775,023   Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares upon redemptions of an equivalent number of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares pursuant to   our   registration statement on Form S-3 (the  registration statement ). The registration statement allows   us  , at   our   option, to issue freely tradable Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees.    
   
  Subsequent Developments    
  On   September 27, 2016  , the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a semi-annual cash dividend of   $1.21     per share on   our   Class A ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on   October 21, 2016  . On     September 28, 2016  , the Board of Directors of Accenture Holdings plc declared a semi-annual cash dividend of   $1.21     per share on   its   ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on   October 18, 2016  . Both dividends are payable on   November 15, 2016  . 
   
  Obligations and Commitments    
  As of   August 31, 2016  , we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, contractual obligations and commercial commitments:    

_______________ 
  Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.    
           (1) 
    The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash outflows from future tax settlements cannot be determined. For additional information, see Note   9   (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.     
              (2) 
    Amounts represent projected payments under certain unfunded retirement plans for former pre-incorporation partners. Given these plans are unfunded, we pay these benefits directly. These plans were eliminated for active partners after May 15, 2001.    
              (3) 
    Other commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. Amounts shown do not include recourse that we may have to recover termination fees or penalties from clients.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    
  In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of these arrangements. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note   15   (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.     
   
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement    
  In August 2016,   we   early adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which amends existing guidance on income taxes to require the classification of all deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current on the balance sheet.   We   adopted this ASU using the retrospective method which required reclassification of current deferred taxes as previously reported on   our   August 31, 2015   Consolidated Balance Sheets to non-current, resulting in an increase to non-current deferred tax assets of   $816 million   and a decrease to noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of   $22 million  . 
  New Accounting Pronouncements    
  On March 31, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which simplifies the accounting for share-based payment transactions. The new guidance requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. In addition, the ASU includes provisions that impact the classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and the classification of excess tax benefits on the cash flow statements.   We   will early adopt the standard effective September 1, 2016. Following adoption, the primary impact on   our   Consolidated Financial Statements will be the recognition of   excess tax benefits in the provision for income taxes rather than Additional paid-in capital, which will likely result in increased volatility in the reported amounts of income tax expense and net income.   We estimate   this change will reduce   our   fiscal 2017 effective tax rate by less than two percentage points. The actual impact of adopting this standard on the effective tax rate will vary depending on   our   share price during fiscal 2017. Provisions of the new guidance related to changes to classification of excess tax benefits in the cash flow statements are expected to be adopted retrospectively.   We are   continuing to evaluate the impacts of the adoption of this guidance and   our   preliminary assessments are subject to change. 
  On March 15, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting, which eliminates the requirement to retrospectively apply equity method accounting when an entity increases ownership or influence in a previously held investment. The ASU will be effective for   us   beginning September 1, 2017, including interim periods in   our   fiscal year 2018.   We do   not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on   our   Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. The ASU will be effective for   us   beginning September 1, 2019, including interim periods in   our   fiscal year 2020, and allows for a modified retrospective method upon adoption.   We are   assessing the impact of this ASU on   our   Consolidated Financial Statements.    
  On January 5, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The ASU will be effective for   us   beginning September 1, 2018, including interim periods in   our    fiscal year 2019.   We do   not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on   our   Consolidated Financial Statements.     
  On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 (Accounting Standard Codification 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. The core principle of the ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. The ASU requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. The ASU will be effective for   us   beginning September 1, 2018, including interim periods in   our   fiscal year 2019, and allows for both retrospective and modified retrospective methods of adoption.   We     will adopt the guidance on September 1, 2018 and apply the modified retrospective method.  We are   assessing the impact of this ASU on   our   Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  All of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading.    
  Foreign Currency Risk    
  We are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business. We hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts. These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk. Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties.    
  Certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year. These hedges primarily U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Euro, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S. dollar/U.K. pound, U.S. dollar/Brazilian real, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso and U.S. dollar/Norwegian krone are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement. Additionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our Global Delivery Network. These hedges U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, Euro/Indian rupee, U.K. pound/Indian rupee and Japanese yen/Chinese yuan, which typically have maturities not exceeding three years are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to resources supplied by our Global Delivery Network. For additional information, see Note   7   (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements   under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.     
  For designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of services. As of   August 31, 2016  , it was anticipated that approximately   $61 million   of net gains, net of tax, currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into Cost of services within the next 12 months.     
  We use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio. The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates. This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure. A 10% change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately   $328 million   and   $305 million   as of   August 31, 2016 and 2015  , respectively  . 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  The interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of   August 31, 2016   is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While we may do so in the future, we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments.    
  Other Market Risk    
  The privately held companies in which we invest are often in a start-up or development stage, which is inherently risky. The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. The evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies. We have minimal exposure on our long-term investments in privately held companies as these investments were insignificant as of   August 31, 2016  . 
  Equity Price Risk 
  The equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

  ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Based on that evaluation, the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of Accenture plc have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
  Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 
           i. 
    pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 
              ii. 
    provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our Board of Directors; and 
              iii. 
    provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
     Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued its attestation report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. See  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  on page F-2. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
    
  The Board of Directors and Shareholders 
  Accenture plc  : 
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Accenture plc and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of August 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders  equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2016. We also have audited Accenture plc s internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2016, based on criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Accenture plc s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (Item 9A). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. 
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Accenture plc and its subsidiaries as of August 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, Accenture plc maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2016, based on criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework     (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

1.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Description of Business    
  Accenture   plc is one of the world s leading organizations providing consulting, technology and outsourcing services and operates globally with one common brand and business model designed to enable it to provide clients around the world with the same high level of service. Drawing on a combination of industry and functional expertise, technology capabilities and alliances, and global delivery resources, Accenture   plc seeks to provide differentiated services that help clients measurably improve their business performance and create sustainable value for their customers and stakeholders. Accenture   plc s global delivery model enables it to provide an end-to-end delivery capability by drawing on its global resources to deliver high-quality, cost-effective solutions to clients.    
  Basis of Presentation    
  The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Accenture plc, an Irish company, and its controlled subsidiary companies (collectively, the  Company ). Accenture plc s only business is to hold ordinary and deferred shares in, and to act as the controlling shareholder of, its subsidiary, Accenture Holdings plc, an Irish public limited company. The Company operates its business through Accenture Holdings plc and subsidiaries of Accenture Holdings plc. Accenture plc controls Accenture Holdings plc s management and operations and consolidates Accenture Holdings plc s results in its Consolidated Financial Statements.    
  On April 10, 2015, Accenture Holdings plc was incorporated in Ireland, as a public limited company, in order to further consolidate Accenture s presence in Ireland. On August 26, 2015, Accenture SCA merged with and into Accenture Holdings plc, with Accenture Holdings plc as the surviving entity. This merger was a transaction between entities under common control and had no effect on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  All references to Accenture Holdings plc included in this report with respect to periods prior to August 26, 2015 reflect the activity and/or balances of Accenture SCA (the predecessor of Accenture Holdings plc).   The shares of     Accenture Holdings plc and   Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by persons other than the Company are treated as a noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Financial Statements.   The noncontrolling interest percentages were   4%     and   5%   as of   August 31, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. 
  All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to the Company s fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to  fiscal   2016    means the 12-month period that ended on   August 31, 2016  . All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of the Company s fiscal year.    
  The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the future, actual results may be different from those estimates.    
  Revenue Recognition    
  Revenues from contracts for technology integration consulting services where the Company designs/redesigns, builds and implements new or enhanced systems applications and related processes for its clients are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared to the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract. Contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years. Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable. This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified. If the Company s estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities.

  (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) 

Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned. The Company considers amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In such contracts, the Company s efforts, measured by time incurred, typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, the Company recognizes revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered and are earned. Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and the Company concludes the amounts are earned.    
  Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries. In a number of these arrangements, the Company hires client employees and becomes responsible for certain client obligations. Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned. Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed. In such contracts, the Company s effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients. Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and the Company concludes the amounts are earned.    
  Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. The deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Deferred transition costs were   $709,444   and   $630,420   as of   August 31, 2016 and 2015  , respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs. Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. Deferred transition revenues were   $604,674   and   $522,968   as of   August 31, 2016 and 2015  , respectively, and are included in non-current Deferred revenues. Contract acquisition and origination costs are expensed as incurred.    
  The Company enters into contracts that may consist of multiple deliverables. These contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services, non-technology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above. Revenues for contracts with multiple deliverables are allocated based on the lesser of the element s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another deliverable. The selling price of each deliverable is determined by obtaining third party evidence of the selling price for the deliverable and is based on the price charged when largely similar services are sold on a standalone basis by the Company to similarly situated customers. If the amount of non-contingent revenues allocated to a deliverable accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent. Revenues are recognized in accordance with the Company s accounting policies for the separate deliverables when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, selling price of the separate deliverables exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the completed deliverable, performance of the in-process deliverable is considered probable and substantially in the Company s control. While determining fair value and identifying separate deliverables require judgment, generally fair value and the separate deliverables are readily identifiable as the Company also sells those deliverables unaccompanied by other deliverables.    
  Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services. Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met. Client prepayments (even if nonrefundable) are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed.

  (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) 

Revenues before reimbursements ( net revenues ) include the margin earned on computer hardware, software and related services resale, as well as revenues from alliance agreements. Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware, software and related services resales. In addition, Reimbursements include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses. The Company reports revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions.    
  Employee Share-Based Compensation Arrangements    
  Share-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards expected to ultimately vest. Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant and revised if actual or expected forfeiture activity differs materially from original estimates.    
  Income Taxes    
  The Company calculates and provides for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The Company establishes liabilities or reduces assets for uncertain tax positions when the Company believes those tax positions are not more likely than not of being sustained if challenged. Each fiscal quarter, the Company evaluates these uncertain tax positions and adjusts the related tax assets and liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances.    
  Translation of Non-U.S. Currency Amounts    
  Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at fiscal year-end exchange rates. Revenue and expense items are translated at average foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the fiscal year. Translation adjustments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions that are of a long-term investment nature are reported in the same manner as translation adjustments.    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents    
  Cash and cash equivalents consist of all cash balances and liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, including certificates of deposit and time deposits. Cash and cash equivalents also include restricted cash of   $45,478   and   $45,935   as of   August 31, 2016 and 2015  , respectively, which primarily relates to cash held to meet certain insurance requirements. As a result of certain subsidiaries  cash management systems, checks issued but not presented to the banks for payment may create negative book cash balances. Such negative balances are classified as Current portion of long term debt and bank borrowings.    
  Client Receivables, Unbilled Services and Allowances    
  The Company records its client receivables and unbilled services at their face amounts less allowances. On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates its receivables and unbilled services and establishes allowances based on historical experience and other currently available information. As of   August 31, 2016 and 2015  , total allowances recorded for client receivables and unbilled services were   $79,440   and   $70,165  , respectively. The allowance reflects the Company s best estimate of collectibility risks on outstanding receivables and unbilled services. In limited circumstances, the Company agrees to extend financing to certain clients. The terms vary by contract, but generally payment for services is contractually linked to the achievement of specified performance milestones.

  (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) 

Concentrations of Credit Risk    
  The Company s financial instruments, consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents, foreign currency exchange rate instruments, client receivables and unbilled services, are exposed to concentrations of credit risk. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents and foreign exchange instruments with highly-rated financial institutions, limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and conducts ongoing evaluations of the credit worthiness of the financial institutions with which it does business. Client receivables are dispersed across many different industries and countries; therefore, concentrations of credit risk are limited.    
  Investments    
  All liquid investments with an original maturity greater than three months but less than one year are considered to be short-term investments. Non-current investments are primarily non-marketable equity securities of privately held companies and are accounted for using either the equity or cost methods of accounting, in accordance with the requirements of Accounting Standards Codification 323, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures. Marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale investments and reported at fair value with changes in unrealized gains and losses recorded as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss until realized. Interest and amortization of premiums and discounts for debt securities are included in Interest income.    
  Cost method investments are periodically assessed for other-than-temporary impairment. For investments in privately held companies, if there are no identified events or circumstances that would have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment, the fair value is not estimated. If an investment is deemed to have experienced an other-than-temporary decline below its cost basis, the Company reduces the carrying amount of the investment to its quoted or estimated fair value, as applicable, and establishes a new cost basis for the investment. 
  Property and Equipment    
  Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:    
                 Computers, related equipment and software 
    2 to 7 years 
      Furniture and fixtures 
    5 to 10 years 
      Leasehold improvements 
    Lesser of lease term or 15 years 

Goodwill    
  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired entity over the fair value of net assets acquired. The Company reviews the recoverability of goodwill by reportable operating segment annually, or more frequently when indicators of impairment exist. Based on the results of its annual impairment analysis, the Company determined that no impairment existed as of   August 31, 2016 and 2015  , as each reportable operating segment s estimated fair value substantially exceeded its carrying value.    
  Long-Lived Assets    
  Long-lived assets, including deferred contract costs and identifiable intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets or groups of assets is assessed based on a comparison of the carrying amount to the estimated future net cash flows. If estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the asset is considered impaired and a loss is recorded equal to the amount required to reduce the carrying amount to fair value.    
  Intangible assets with finite lives are generally amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated economic useful lives, ranging from   one   to   fifteen   years.

     Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement    
  In August 2016,   the Company   early adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which amends existing guidance on income taxes to require the classification of all deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current on the balance sheet.     The Company   adopted this ASU using the retrospective method which required reclassification of current deferred taxes as previously reported on   the Company s   August 31, 2015   Consolidated Balance Sheets to non-current, resulting in an increase to non-current deferred tax assets of   $815,909   and a decrease to noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of   $22,218  . 
  New Accounting Pronouncements    
  On March 31, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which simplifies the accounting for share-based payment transactions. The new guidance requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. In addition, the ASU includes provisions that impact the classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and the classification of excess tax benefits on the cash flow statements.   The Company   will early adopt the standard effective September 1, 2016. Following adoption, the primary impact on   the Company s   Consolidated Financial Statements will be the recognition of   excess tax benefits in the provision for income taxes rather than Additional paid-in capital, which will likely result in increased volatility in the reported amounts of income tax expense and net income.   The Company estimates   this change will reduce   its   fiscal 2017 effective tax rate by less than two percentage points. The actual impact of adopting this standard on the effective tax rate will vary depending on   the Company s   share price during fiscal 2017. Provisions of the new guidance related to changes to classification of excess tax benefits in the cash flow statements are expected to be adopted retrospectively.   The Company is   continuing to evaluate the impacts of the adoption of this guidance and   its   preliminary assessments are subject to change.    
  On March 15, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting, which eliminates the requirement to retrospectively apply equity method accounting when an entity increases ownership or influence in a previously held investment. The ASU will be effective for   the Company   beginning September 1, 2017, including interim periods in   its   fiscal year 2018.   The Company does   not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on   its   Consolidated Financial Statements.    
  On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. The ASU will be effective for   the Company   beginning September 1, 2019, including interim periods in   its   fiscal year 2020, and allows for a modified retrospective method upon adoption.   The Company is   assessing the impact of this ASU on   its     Consolidated Financial Statements.    
  On January 5, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The ASU will be effective for   the Company   beginning September 1, 2018, including interim periods in   its   fiscal year 2019.   The Company   does   not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on     its   Consolidated Financial Statements.

On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 (Accounting Standard Codification 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. The core principle of the ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. The ASU requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. The ASU will be effective for   the Company   beginning September 1, 2018, including interim periods in   its   fiscal year 2019, and allows for both retrospective and modified retrospective methods of adoption.     The Company   will adopt the guidance on September 1, 2018 and apply the modified retrospective method.     The Company is   assessing the impact of this ASU on   its   Consolidated Financial Statements.

7.      DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS    
  In the normal course of business, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Derivative transactions are governed by a uniform set of policies and procedures covering areas such as authorization, counterparty exposure and hedging practices. Positions are monitored using techniques such as market value and sensitivity analyses. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. The Company classifies cash flows from its derivative programs as cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Cash Flows Statements.    
  Certain derivatives also give rise to credit risks from the possible non-performance by counterparties. Credit risk is generally limited to the fair value of those contracts that are favorable to the Company, and the maximum amount of loss due to credit risk, based on the gross fair value of all of the Company s derivative financial instruments, was   $129,603   as of   August 31, 2016  .    
  The Company also utilizes standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. These provisions may reduce the Company s potential overall loss resulting from the insolvency of a counterparty and reduce a counterparty s potential overall loss resulting from the insolvency of the Company. Additionally, these agreements contain early termination provisions triggered by adverse changes in a counterparty s credit rating, thereby enabling the Company to accelerate settlement of a transaction prior to its contractual maturity and potentially decrease the Company s realized loss on an open transaction. Similarly, a decrement in the Company s credit rating could trigger a counterparty s early termination rights, thereby enabling a counterparty to accelerate settlement of a transaction prior to its contractual maturity and potentially increase the Company s realized loss on an open transaction. The aggregate fair value of the Company s derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a liability position as of   August 31, 2016   was   $33,774  .    
  The Company s derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. Fair values for derivative financial instruments are based on prices computed using third-party valuation models and are classified as Level 2 in accordance with the three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements. All of the significant inputs to the third-party valuation models are observable in active markets. Inputs include current market-based parameters such as forward rates, yield curves and credit default swap pricing. For additional information related to the three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements, see Note   10   (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.    
  Cash Flow Hedges    
  Certain of the Company s subsidiaries are exposed to currency risk through their use of resources supplied by the Company s Global Delivery Network. To mitigate this risk, the Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the foreign exchange risk of the forecasted intercompany expenses denominated in foreign currencies for up to three years in the future. The Company has designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges. As of   August 31, 2016 and 2015  , the Company held no derivatives that were designated as fair value or net investment hedges.    
  In order for a derivative to qualify for hedge accounting, the derivative must be formally designated as a fair value, cash flow or net investment hedge by documenting the relationship between the derivative and the hedged item. The documentation includes a description of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the risk being hedged, the Company s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the method for assessing the effectiveness of the hedge and the method for measuring hedge ineffectiveness. Additionally, the hedge relationship must be expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item at both inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis. The Company assesses the ongoing effectiveness of its hedges using the Hypothetical Derivative Method, which measures hedge ineffectiveness based on a comparison of the change in fair value of the actual derivative designated as the hedging instrument and the change in fair value of a hypothetical derivative. The hypothetical derivative would have terms that identically match the critical terms of the hedged item. The Company measures and records hedge ineffectiveness at the end of each fiscal quarter.    
  For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders  Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statement during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. The amounts related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services were a net gain of   $23,004   and   $15,207   during   fiscal 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and a net loss of   $101,026   during   fiscal 2014  . The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a cash flow hedge is recognized immediately

in   Other expense, net   in the Consolidated Income Statement and for fiscal   2016, 2015 and 2014  , was not material. In addition, the Company did not discontinue any cash flow hedges during fiscal   2016 and 2015   or   2014  .  
  Other Derivatives    
  The Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts, which have not been designated as hedges, to hedge balance sheet exposures, such as intercompany loans. These instruments are generally short-term in nature, with typical maturities of less than one year, and are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of these derivatives were a net loss of   $84,293   and   $257,783   for fiscal   2016 and 2015  , respectively, and a net gain of   $78,446   for fiscal   2014  . Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in   Other expense, net   in the Consolidated Income Statement and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items.    
  Fair Value of Derivative Instruments    
  The notional and fair values of all derivative instruments were as follows:    

The Company utilizes standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for the set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the Company records derivative assets and liabilities at gross fair value. The potential effect of netting derivative assets against liabilities under the counterparty master agreements was as follows:

8.      BORROWINGS AND INDEBTEDNESS    
  As of   August 31, 2016  , the Company had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes:    

_______________  
           (1) 
    On   December 22, 2015  , the Company   replaced   its   $1,000,000   syndicated loan facility maturing on   October 31, 2016   with a   $1,000,000   syndicated loan facility maturing on   December 22, 2020  . This facility provides unsecured, revolving borrowing capacity for general working capital purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit. Financing is provided under this facility at the prime rate or at the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. This facility requires   the Company   to: (1) limit liens placed on   its   assets to (a) liens incurred in the ordinary course of business (subject to certain qualifications) and (b) other liens securing obligations not to exceed   30%   of   its   consolidated assets; and (2) maintain an Adjusted Indebtedness-to-EBITDA ratio not exceeding   1.75   to   1.00  . The Company   continues   to be in compliance with relevant covenant terms. The facility is subject to annual commitment fees. As of   August 31, 2016   and   2015  , the Company   had   no   borrowings under either the current or the prior loan facility. 
              (2) 
    The Company maintains separate, uncommitted and unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities. These facilities provide local currency financing for the majority of the Company s operations. Interest rate terms on the revolving facilities are at market rates prevailing in the relevant local markets. As of   August 31, 2016 and 2015  , the Company had   no   borrowings under these facilities.    
              (3) 
    The Company also maintains local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit for those locations that cannot access the Company s global facilities. As of   August 31, 2016 and 2015  , the Company had   no   borrowings under these various facilities.    
     Under the borrowing facilities described above, the Company had an aggregate of   $168,663   and   $166,506   of letters of credit outstanding as of   August 31, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. In addition, the Company had total outstanding debt of   $27,230   and   $27,435   as of   August 31, 2016 and 2015  , respectively.

The components of Income before income taxes were as follows:    

The reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the Company s effective income tax rate was as follows:    

_______________  
           (1) 
    Final determinations include final agreements with tax authorities and expirations of statutes of limitations.    
     During   fiscal 2015  , the Company concluded that substantially all of the undistributed earnings of its U.S. subsidiaries would no longer be considered indefinitely reinvested and recorded an estimated tax liability of   $247,097     for withholding taxes payable on the distribution of these earnings. These earnings were distributed in the form of a U.S. dividend declared and paid on August 26, 2015  . The Company intends to indefinitely reinvest any future U.S. earnings. As of   August 31, 2016  , the Company had not recognized a deferred tax liability on   $1,297,932   of undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries, because these earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested. If such earnings were distributed, some countries may impose additional taxes. The unrecognized deferred tax liability (the amount payable if distributed) is approximately   $116,000  .

Portions of the Company s operations are subject to reduced tax rates or are free of tax under various tax holidays which expire between fiscal   2017   and   2021  . Some of the holidays are renewable at reduced levels, under certain conditions, with possible renewal periods through   2031  . The income tax benefits attributable to the tax status of these subsidiaries were estimated to be approximately   $100,000  ,   $111,000   and   $91,000   in fiscal   2016, 2015 and 2014  , respectively.    
  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of enacted changes in tax laws and tax rates did not have a material impact on the Company s effective tax rate.    
  The components of the Company s deferred tax assets and liabilities included the following:    

The Company recorded valuation allowances of   $1,243,207   and   $1,229,146   as of   August 31, 2016 and 2015  , respectively,   against deferred tax assets principally associated with certain tax credit and tax net operating loss carryforwards, as the Company believes it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized. For all other deferred tax assets, the Company believes it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets. During fiscal   2016  , the Company recorded a net increase of   $14,061   in the valuation allowance. The majority of this change related to valuation allowances on certain tax   net operating loss   carryforwards, as the Company believes it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized.    
  The Company had tax credit carryforwards as of   August 31, 2016   of   $1,161,084  , of which   $30,288   will expire between   2017 and 2026  ,   $828   will expire between   2027 and 2036  , and   $1,129,968   has an indefinite carryforward period. The Company had net operating loss carryforwards as of   August 31, 2016   of   $518,475  . Of this amount,   $254,978   expires between   2017 and 2026  ,   $2,130   expires between   2027 and 2036  , and   $261,367   has an indefinite carryforward period.    
  As of   August 31, 2016  , the Company had   $985,755   of unrecognized tax benefits, of which   $508,313  , if recognized, would favorably affect the Company s effective tax rate. As of   August 31, 2015  , the Company had   $997,935   of unrecognized tax benefits, of which   $534,929  , if recognized, would favorably affect the Company s effective tax rate.     The remaining unrecognized benefits as of   August 31, 2016 and 2015   of   $477,442   and   $463,006  , respectively, represent

items recorded as adjustments to equity and offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes and timing adjustments.    
  A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits was as follows:    

The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the Provision for income taxes. During fiscal   2016, 2015 and 2014  , the Company recognized expense (benefit) of   $8,681  ,   $(17,373)   and   $16,370   in interest and penalties, respectively. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of   $109,269   (  $95,057  , net of tax benefits) and   $101,843   (  $84,530  , net of tax benefits) were reflected on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   August 31, 2016 and 2015  , respectively.    
  The Company is   participatin  g in the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) Compliance Assurance Program ( CAP ) beginning with the 2016 fiscal year. As part of CAP, tax years are audited on a contemporaneous basis so that all or most issues are resolved prior to the filing of the tax return. The Company is currently under audit by the IRS for fiscal 2013 and 2014. The Company is also currently under audit in numerous state and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain and could result in significant cash tax payments, the Company does not believe the outcome of these audits will have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations. With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax audits by taxing authorities for the years before 2007. The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately   $562,000     or increase by approximately   $169,000   in the next 12 months as a result of settlements, lapses of statutes of limitations and other adjustments. The majority of these amounts relate to transfer pricing matters in both U.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.

10.      RETIREMENT AND PROFIT SHARING PLANS    
  Defined Benefit Pension and Postretirement Plans    
  In the United States and certain other countries, the Company maintains and administers defined benefit retirement plans and postretirement medical plans for certain current, retired and resigned employees. In addition, the Company s U.S. defined benefit pension plans include a frozen plan for former pre-incorporation partners, which is unfunded. Benefits under the employee retirement plans are primarily based on years of service and compensation during the years immediately preceding retirement or termination of participation in the plan. The defined benefit pension disclosures include the Company s U.S. and material non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans.    
  Assumptions    
  The weighted-average assumptions used to determine the defined benefit pension obligations as of August 31 and the net periodic pension expense were as follows:    

Beginning in fiscal 2016, the Company changed the method it uses to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension expense. Historically, the Company selected a discount rate for the U.S. plans by matching the plans  cash flows to that of the average of two yield curves that provide the equivalent yields on zero-coupon corporate bonds for each maturity. The discount rate assumption for the non-U.S. Plans primarily reflected the market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments. Beginning in fiscal 2016, the Company utilized a full yield curve approach to estimate these components by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. The Company made this change to improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs. This change does not affect the measurement of the Company s total benefit obligations. The Company accounted for this change as a change in estimate and, accordingly, recognized its effect prospectively beginning in fiscal 2016. 
  The discount rate assumptions are based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for each of the Company s defined benefit pension and postretirement plans as of the annual measurement date and are subject to change each year.    
  The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets should, over time, approximate the actual long-term returns on defined benefit pension and postretirement plan assets and is based on historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class, as well as the target asset allocation of the asset portfolio.

  (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) 

Assumed U.S. Health Care Cost Trend    
  The Company s U.S. postretirement plan assumed annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of health care benefits is   6.8%   for the plan year ending June 30, 2017. The rate is assumed to decrease on a straight-line basis to     4.5%   for the plan year ending June 30, 2027 and remain at that level thereafter. A one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase the benefit obligation by   $81,422  , while a one percentage point decrease would reduce the benefit obligation by   $62,615  .    
  U.S. Defined Benefit Pension Plan Settlement Charge    
  During fiscal 2015, the Company offered a voluntary one-time lump sum payment option to certain eligible former employees who had vested benefits under the Company s U.S. pension plan that, if accepted, would settle the Company s pension obligations to them.   This   resulted in lump sum payments from plan assets of   $279,571   during fiscal 2015. As a result of this settlement and the adoption of the new U.S. mortality tables released by the Society of Actuaries, the Company remeasured the assets and liabilities of the U.S. pension plan, which in aggregate resulted in a net reduction to the projected benefit obligation of   $179,938   as well as a non-cash settlement charge of     $64,382  , pre-tax, during fiscal 2015.    
  Pension and Postretirement Expense    
  Pension expense for fiscal   2016, 2015 and 2014   was   $94,827  ,     $143,968   (including the above noted settlement charge) and   $87,422  , respectively. Postretirement expense for fiscal   2016, 2015 and 2014   was not material to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Investment Strategies    
  U.S. Pension Plans 
  The overall investment objective of the defined benefit pension plans is to match the duration of the plans  assets to the plans  liabilities while managing risk in order to meet current defined benefit pension obligations. The plans  future prospects, their current financial conditions, the Company s current funding levels and other relevant factors suggest that the plans can tolerate some interim fluctuations in market value and rates of return in order to achieve long-term objectives without undue risk to the plans  ability to meet their current benefit obligations. The Company recognizes that asset allocation of the defined benefit pension plans  assets is an important factor in determining long-term performance. Actual asset allocations at any point in time may vary from the target asset allocations and will be dictated by current and anticipated market conditions, required cash flows and investment decisions of the investment committee and the pension plans  investment funds and managers. Ranges are established to provide flexibility for the asset allocation to vary around the targets without the need for immediate rebalancing.    
  Non-U.S. Pension Plans    
  Plan assets in non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans conform to the investment policies and procedures of each plan and to relevant legislation. The pension committee or trustee of each plan regularly, but at least annually, reviews the investment policy and the performance of the investment managers. In certain countries, the trustee is also required to consult with the Company. Asset allocation decisions are made to provide risk adjusted returns that align with the overall investment strategy for each plan. Generally, the investment return objective of each plan is to achieve a total annualized rate of return that exceeds inflation over the long term by an amount based on the target asset allocation mix of that plan. In certain countries, plan assets are invested in funds that are required to hold a majority of assets in bonds, with a smaller proportion in equities. Also, certain plan assets are entirely invested in contracts held with the plan insurer, which determines the strategy. Defined benefit pension plans in certain countries are unfunded.    
  Risk Management    
  Plan investments are exposed to risks including market, interest rate and operating risk. In order to mitigate significant concentrations of these risks, the assets are invested in a diversified portfolio primarily consisting of fixed income instruments and equities. To minimize asset volatility relative to the liabilities, plan assets allocated to debt securities appropriately match the duration of individual plan liabilities. Equities are diversified between U.S. and non-U.S. index funds and are intended to achieve long term capital appreciation. Plan asset allocation and investment managers  guidelines are reviewed on a regular basis.    
  Plan Assets    
  The Company s target allocation for fiscal   2017   and weighted-average plan assets allocations as of   August 31, 2016 and 2015   by asset category for defined benefit pension plans were as follows:

Fair Value Measurements    
  Fair value is the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity.    
  The three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements is based on whether the inputs to those measurements are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company s market assumptions. The fair-value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available and consists of the following levels:    
             
    Level 1 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;    
                
    Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets; and    
                
    Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.    
     The fair values of defined benefit pension and postretirement plan assets as of   August 31, 2016   were as follows:    

There were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2 during   fiscal 2016  .

Expected Contributions    
  Generally, annual contributions are made at such times and in amounts as required by law and may, from time to time, exceed minimum funding requirements. The Company estimates it will pay approximately   $80,077   in fiscal     2017   related to contributions to its U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans and benefit payments related to the unfunded frozen plan for former pre-incorporation partners. The Company has not determined whether it will make additional voluntary contributions for its defined benefit pension plans. The Company s postretirement plan contributions in fiscal 2017 are not expected to be material to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.    
  Estimated Future Benefit Payments    
  Benefit payments for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:    

_______________ 
  (1)    Excludes the impact of the anticipated U.S. pension plan termination noted below. 
  U.S. Pension Plan Termination 
  On   March 18, 2016  , Accenture plc s Board of Directors approved an amendment to terminate the Company s U.S. pension plan, effective   May 30, 2016  , for all active and former employees who are no longer accruing benefits in the pension plan (approximately   16,200   people). The amendment also provides for the creation of a separate defined benefit plan with substantially the same terms for approximately   600   active employees who are currently eligible to accrue benefits. The U.S. pension plan is expected to be settled in   12   to   18   months from the termination effective date, subject to receipt of customary regulatory approvals.  
  The Company s ultimate settlement obligation will depend upon both the nature and timing of participant settlements and prevailing market conditions. Upon settlement, the Company expects to recognize additional expense, consisting of unrecognized actuarial losses included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss that totaled approximately   $467,000   as of   August 31, 2016  , adjusted for the difference between the ultimate settlement obligation and the Company s accrued pension obligation. The Company does not expect the settlement of the U.S. pension plan obligations to have a material impact on its cash position.  
  Defined Contribution Plans    
  In the United States and certain other countries, the Company maintains and administers defined contribution plans for certain current, retired and resigned employees. Total expenses recorded for defined contribution plans were     $419,932  ,   $397,123   and   $331,801   in fiscal   2016, 2015 and 2014  , respectively.

The Company   issues new Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and shares from treasury for shares delivered under the Amended 2010 SIP.    
  A summary of information with respect to share-based compensation is as follows:    

Restricted Share Units    
  Under the Amended 2010 SIP, participants may be, and previously under the predecessor 2001 Share Incentive Plan were, granted restricted share units, each of which represent an unfunded, unsecured right to receive an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share on the date specified in the participant s award agreement. The fair value of the awards is based on   the Company s   stock price on the date of grant. The restricted share units granted under these plans are subject to cliff or graded vesting, generally ranging from   two   to   seven   years. For awards with graded vesting, compensation expense is recognized over the vesting term of each separately vesting portion. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis for awards with cliff vesting. Restricted share unit activity during fiscal   2016   was as follows:    

_______________ 
    As of   August 31, 2016  , there was   $677,433   of total restricted share unit compensation expense related to nonvested awards not yet recognized, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   1.3   years. As of   August 31, 2016  , there were   930,652   restricted share units vested but not yet delivered as Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares.    
  Stock Options 
  There were no stock options granted during fiscal   2016, 2015 or 2014  . As of   August 31, 2016   we had   23,310   stock options outstanding and exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of   $37.46   and a weighted average remaining contractual term of   2.5   years.

  Accenture plc    
  Ordinary Shares    
  The Company has   40,000   authorized   ordinary   shares, par value    1   per share. Each   ordinary   share of Accenture     plc entitles its holder to receive payments upon a liquidation of Accenture    however a holder of an   ordinary   share is not entitled to vote on matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of Accenture   plc or to receive dividends.    
  Class A Ordinary Shares    
  An Accenture plc Class A ordinary share entitles its holder to   one   vote per share, and holders of those shares do not have cumulative voting rights. Each Class A ordinary share entitles its holder to a pro rata part of any dividend at the times and in the amounts, if any, which Accenture plc s Board of Directors from time to time determines to declare, subject to any preferred dividend rights attaching to any preferred shares. Each Class A ordinary share is entitled on a winding-up of Accenture plc to be paid a pro rata part of the value of the assets of Accenture plc remaining after payment of its liabilities, subject to any preferred rights on liquidation attaching to any preferred shares.    
  Class X Ordinary Shares

Accenture plc may redeem, at its option, any Class X ordinary share for a redemption price equal to the par value of the Class X ordinary share. Accenture plc has separately agreed with the original holders of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares not to redeem any Class X ordinary share of such holder if the redemption would reduce the number of Class X ordinary shares held by that holder to a number that is less than the number of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares owned by that holder, as the case may be. Accenture plc will redeem Class X ordinary shares upon the redemption or exchange of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares so that the aggregate number of Class X ordinary shares outstanding at any time does not exceed the aggregate number of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares outstanding.

13.      MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS AFFECTING SHAREHOLDERS  EQUITY    
  Share Purchases and Redemptions    
  The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding   for the Company s publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and   for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees.

  The Company s share purchase activity during fiscal   2016   was as follows:    

_______________ 
           (1) 
    The Company conducts a publicly announced open-market share purchase program for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to the Company s employees.    
              (2)

15.      COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES    
  Commitments    
  The Company has the right to purchase or may also be required to purchase substantially all of the remaining outstanding shares of its Avanade Inc. subsidiary ( Avanade ) not owned by the Company at fair value if certain events occur. Certain holders of Avanade common stock and options to purchase the stock have put rights that, under certain circumstances and conditions, would require Avanade to redeem shares of its stock at fair value. As of   August 31, 2016 and 2015  , the Company has reflected the fair value of   $54,221   and   $79,023  , respectively, related to Avanade s redeemable common stock and the intrinsic value of the options on redeemable common stock in Other accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.    
  Indemnifications and Guarantees    
  In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements through which it may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. These arrangements with clients can include provisions whereby the Company has joint and several liability in relation to the performance of certain contractual obligations along with third parties also providing services and products for a specific project. In addition, the Company s consulting arrangements may include warranty provisions that the Company s solutions will substantially operate in accordance with the applicable system requirements. Indemnification provisions are also included in arrangements under which the Company agrees to hold the indemnified party harmless with respect to third-party claims related to such matters as title to assets sold or licensed or certain intellectual property rights.    
  Typically, the Company has contractual recourse against third parties for certain payments made by the Company in connection with arrangements where third-party nonperformance has given rise to the client s claim. Payments by the Company under any of the arrangements described above are generally conditioned on the client making a claim, which may be disputed by the Company typically under dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular arrangement. The limitations of liability under these arrangements may be expressly limited or may not be expressly specified in terms of time and/or amount.    
  As of   August 31, 2016 and 2015  , the Company s aggregate potential liability to its clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately   $749,000   and   $655,000  , respectively, of which all but approximately   $113,000   and   $43,000  , respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if the Company is obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement.    
  To date, the Company has not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. The Company has assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty obligations, unspecified limitations and/or indemnification provisions and believes that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole.    
  Legal Contingencies    
  As of   August 31, 2016  , the Company or its present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. The Company and/or its personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of its business around the world. Based on the present status of these matters, management believes the range of reasonably possible losses in addition to amounts accrued, net of insurance recoveries, will not have a material effect on the Company s results of operations or financial condition.

16.      SEGMENT REPORTING    
  Operating segments are components of an enterprise where separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.    
  The Company s chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer. The Company s operating segments are managed separately because each operating segment represents a strategic business unit providing consulting and outsourcing services to clients in different industries.    
     The Company s reportable operating segments are the five operating groups, which are Communications, Media   Technology, Financial Services, Health   Public Service, Products and Resources. Information regarding the Company s reportable operating segments is as follows: 

_______________ 
           (1) 
    Amounts include depreciation on property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets controlled by each operating segment, as well as an allocation for amounts they do not directly control.    
              (2) 
    The Company does not allocate total assets by operating segment. Operating segment assets directly attributed to an operating segment and provided to the chief operating decision maker include Receivables from clients, current and non-current Unbilled services, Deferred contract costs and current and non-current Deferred revenues.    
     The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.

INTRODUCTION 
  Accenture LLP ( Accenture ) adopted this restated Accenture LLP Leadership Separation Benefits Plan (f/k/a the Accenture LLP Senior Executive Separation Benefits Plan) (the  Program ), originally effective as of April 15, 2010 (the  Effective Date ), for the benefit of the Eligible Employees.  The Program is hereby restated effective as of November 1, 2012.  The Program is an unfunded welfare benefit plan for purposes of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (hereinafter  ERISA ), a severance pay plan within the meaning of Department of Labor Reg.   2510.3-2(b) and an involuntary separation pay program under Treas. Reg.   1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii).  Except as otherwise set forth in this document, the Program supersedes each prior Accenture severance plan, program or policy covering an Eligible Employee, both formal and informal, including, but not limited to, the Accenture United States Separation Benefits Plan.  The purpose of the Program is to provide an Eligible Employee who is involuntarily terminated from Accenture with Separation Benefits.  This document serves as both the plan document and summary plan description under ERISA. 
  ELIGIBILITY 
  An Eligible Employee shall become a Participant, and shall receive Separation Benefits subject to the terms and conditions of the Program, if the Eligible Employee s employment with Accenture is involuntarily terminated in connection with the Program and the Eligible Employee submits (and does not later revoke) a signed Separation Agreement to Accenture by the stated deadline below.   
  In no event, however, will an Eligible Employee become a Participant in the Program if any of the following applies to the Eligible Employee: 
             
    the Eligible Employee s employment is terminated for Cause; 
                
    the Eligible Employee is offered a Comparable Position with Accenture (or an Affiliate) prior to the Eligible Employee s Termination Date; 
                
    the Eligible Employee s employment terminates because of his voluntary termination, job abandonment, death, or any reason other than in connection with the Program; 
                
    the Eligible Employee requests to return to employment with Accenture following an unpaid leave of absence or a period of long-term disability, and Accenture determines that there are no available positions for which the Eligible Employee is qualified; provided, however, this provision shall not apply to an Eligible Employee returning from a leave of absence which has a legally-protected status (such as Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) leave); 
                
    in connection with a business transaction involving Accenture or an Affiliate (including, without limitation, a sale of assets of Accenture, an outsourcing transaction, or a contractual arrangement with a third party), the Eligible Employee is offered a position with the other party to the transaction (or one of its affiliates) prior to the Eligible Employee s Termination Date; 

the Eligible Employee becomes eligible to receive long-term disability benefits from Accenture; or 
                
    the Eligible Employee fails to comply with any condition set forth in the Program. 
     Though participants terminated for  Cause  or  Deficient Performance  are not eligible for plan benefits, residents of Puerto Rico still may be eligible for legislatively-required severance payments, provided the circumstances of the separation do not meet the definition of  Just Cause  under P.R. Act No. 80. 
  All determinations of eligibility for the Program shall be made by Accenture in its sole discretion. 
  PARTICIPATION 
  Only Participants are eligible for Separation Benefits.  Subject to the terms and conditions of the Program, a Participant whose employment is involuntarily terminated in connection with the Program shall be entitled to the Separation Benefits set forth in the applicable appendix.  Eligible Employees will be required to sign a Separation Agreement and all other documentation to become a Participant and receive Separation Benefits.  Eligible Employees shall also be required to sign a document entitled  Amendment to Restricted Share Unit and Other Grant Agreements  that shall be included in the Participant s departure documentation.  Eligible Employees shall be advised to consult a personal attorney to review the Separation Agreement.   
  An Eligible Employee must submit a signed Separation Agreement to Accenture not earlier than his or her Termination Date and not after the deadline set forth in the Separation Agreement.  An Eligible Employee may have a right to revoke the Separation Agreement.  If such a right exists, it shall be set forth in the Separation Agreement.  Any such revocation must be in writing and must be received by Accenture during the time frame set forth in the Separation Agreement.  An Eligible Employee who chooses not to submit a signed Separation Agreement to Accenture or who effectively revokes the signed Separation Agreement, shall nonetheless terminate employment as of his or her Termination Date but will not be eligible to receive Separation Benefits.  As noted above, Separation Agreements will not be accepted prior to an Eligible Employee s Termination Date nor after the deadline set forth in the Separation Agreement. 
  Signed Separation Agreements (and any other accompanying documents to be signed) must be faxed to Accenture Exit Services Team at (312) 737-9391, scanned and emailed to   AccNA.Exits.Team@accenture.com     or mailed to the following address: 
  Accenture Exit Services Team  c/o HR Transactions  6415 Babcock, Suite 100  San Antonio, TX 78249-2963 
  In the event an Eligible Employee breaches the provisions of the Separation Agreement, the payment of Separation Benefits shall cease and Accenture shall exercise, and the Eligible Employee shall be bound by, the remedies provided in the Separation Agreement. 

SEPARATION BENEFITS 
  An Eligible Employee who complies with each term in this Plan and each term in the Separation Agreement shall be entitled to the following Separation Benefits. 
  Separation Pay 
  The amount of Separation Pay that a Participant shall be entitled to receive depends upon the circumstances of the Participant s termination and his or her Years of Service, as described in the charts below.   
  Standard Package 
  Each Participant terminated other than for Performance Reasons shall be entitled to receive Separation Pay which shall consist of (1) a base benefit determined by the Participant s career level as of the Termination Date, (2) a variable benefit based on the Participant s Years of Service, and (3) a COBRA Payment (more fully described below).  The total amount of a Participant s base and variable benefits are subject to a maximum as set forth below. 
                   Base Benefit 
    Variable Benefit     
    COBRA Payment 
      6 Months of Pay 
    1 Week of Pay for each complete Year of Service (rounded down to last complete Year of Service), but not to exceed 8 Weeks of Pay. 
    $12,000 

Performance Package 
  Each Participant terminated for Performance Reasons shall be entitled to receive Separation Pay as outlined below:   

Unless otherwise required by law and except as provided in the following sentence, Separation Pay shall be paid in a single lump sum on the next regular payroll date following the date Accenture receives the signed Separation Agreement or, in the case of a Participant entitled to revoke the signed Separation Agreement, the next regular payroll date following the date the applicable revocation period expires (or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter in accordance with Accenture s payroll procedures).  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Plan Administrator may, in his or her sole discretion, elect to provide the Separation Pay on a payroll-by-payroll basis in lieu of a single lump sum.  If a Participant dies before receiving full payment of his Separation Pay, such amounts will be paid to his estate. 

If a Participant is on a short-term disability ( STD ) leave as of his or her Termination Date or was scheduled to commence an STD leave no later than thirty (30) days following his or her Termination Date, the Participant s Separation Pay also shall include additional Weeks of Pay (as described below) for the lesser of (i) the number of weeks (if any) remaining in the paid-time portion of his or her scheduled STD leave, or (ii) eight (8) weeks.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the number of weeks in (or remaining in) the paid-time portion of a Participant s scheduled leave is not known prior to the payment of his or her Separation Pay, the Participant shall receive eight (8) Weeks of Pay.  For purposes of this paragraph only, a  Week of Pay  means a Participant s STD pay as determined by Accenture in accordance with Accenture s Short-Term Disability Leave Policy, as amended from time to time. 
  Professional Outplacement Services 
  As additional consideration for signing and not later revoking the Separation Agreement, each Participant, including a Participant terminated for Performance Reasons, shall be entitled to participate in a Managing Director Professional Outplacement Services program to be provided by an outside firm selected by Accenture.  Each Participant shall receive from Accenture separate, detailed information about the Professional Outplacement Services program, including the duration of the program, the types of available services, how to enroll, and the locations of available programs.  No Participant may receive cash in lieu of the Professional Outplacement Services.  A Participant must enroll in the Professional Outplacement Services program in order to participate; enrollment is not automatic.  A Participant may enroll in the Professional Outplacement Services program not before the later of the date the Participant submits the Separation Agreement or, in the case of a Participant entitled to revoke the Separation Agreement, upon expiration of the applicable Separation Agreement.  A Participant must enroll in the Professional Outplacement Services program no later than sixty (60) days after the Termination Date or, in the case of a Participant entitled to revoke the Separation Agreement, no later than sixty (60) days after the date the revocation period expires. 
  COBRA Payment 
  The Participant shall be entitled to receive the COBRA Payment whether or not the Participant is enrolled for coverage in the Active Medical Plan and/or Dental Plan and whether or not the Participant elects COBRA Continuation Coverage.  To receive COBRA Continuation Coverage, a Participant must elect such coverage in accordance with the terms of the Active Medical Plan and/or Dental Plan and otherwise comply with the terms and conditions that apply.   
  Equity Compensation 
  A Participant s termination of employment affects his or her rights and responsibilities under the various forms of equity compensation received during employment.  These may include Founders Shares, Promotion Awards, Celebratory Awards, awards under the Bonus Share Program and may include restricted stock units and stock options.  The type of award, the Participant s age and the date the equity was awarded, among other factors, may all be relevant for determining how termination of employment affects equity compensation.  Each Participant should review the terms of the applicable equity compensation plan document and grant agreements to determine how termination of employment affects equity compensation.   

RETURN OF ACCENTURE PROPERTY/TIME REPORTS 
  As a condition of receiving Separation Benefits under the Program, an Eligible Employee must return to Accenture all Accenture property (e.g., building keys, credit cards, documents and records, identification cards, office equipment, portable computers, car/mobile phones, parking cards, computer diskettes).  In addition, the balance of any expense against an Eligible Employee s Accenture personnel number must be zero, an Eligible Employee must submit final time reports, submit all outstanding expense receipts, and have no balance on any Accenture related credit cards or credit accounts, including but not limited to a Corporate American Express card.  If an Eligible Employee has a credit card or credit account balance, the Plan Administrator may require such Eligible Employee to pay the entire outstanding balance in full within sixty (60) days of the Termination Date before he or she may be entitled to receive Separation Benefits.  Any Accenture property must be returned to Accenture no later than the Eligible Employee s Termination Date. 
  Accenture reserves the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to reduce (on a dollar-for-dollar basis) the amount of any Separation Benefits payable to a Participant under the Program by any disability, severance, separation, termination pay, or pay-in-lieu of notice amounts that Accenture pays or is required to pay to the Participant through insurance or otherwise under any plan or contract of Accenture (including the amount of any compensation payable and the value of any benefits to be provided during any notice period under an employment agreement with Accenture or any Affiliate) or under any federal or state law (other than unemployment compensation). In addition, Accenture reserves the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to reduce the amount of Separation Benefits payable to a Participant under the Program by the amount, if any, that the Participant owes Accenture (or an Affiliate). 
  PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT, PERFORMANCE AND COOPERATION 
  As a condition of receiving any Separation Benefits under the Program, each Eligible Employee must:  (i) continue to exhibit professional conduct in the workplace; (ii) adhere to all Accenture practices and policies; (iii) perform his or her regular job duties and responsibilities in accordance with required performance standards; (iv) successfully transition job activities; and (v) cooperate with Accenture personnel in matters relating to his or her position or termination.  If an Eligible Employee does not comply with the foregoing requirements during and after the remainder of his or her employment, as determined by the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion, such Eligible Employee shall forfeit all benefits under the Program. 
  REEMPLOYMENT 
  If a Participant accepts a job offer from Accenture or an Affiliate after his Termination Date, but prior to payment of his Separation Benefits, the Participant shall not be entitled to receive Separation Benefits.  If a Participant is re-employed by Accenture or an Affiliate after receiving Separation Pay, he must repay to Accenture an amount equal to his Separation Pay but not the cost of any Professional Outplacement Services.  Such repayment must be made within fifteen (15) days following reemployment (or such later date as may be specified by Accenture).  A Participant will not, however, be required to repay Separation Pay in the following circumstances: 

A Participant will not be required to repay any portion of the Separation Pay if Accenture decides not to apply this requirement to such Participant.  Accenture has complete discretion to decide whether (and to what extent) to require repayment by any particular Participant, taking into account, among other things, the best interests of Accenture and its Affiliates. 
                
    A Participant will not be required to repay his Separation Pay if such Participant is rehired by Accenture or an Affiliate after a period equal to the total number of weeks represented by that Participant s Separation Pay.  If a Participant is rehired by Accenture or an Affiliate prior to expiration of the period equal to the total number of weeks represented by that Participant s Separation Pay, the Participant shall be required to repay a prorated portion of that Participant s Separation Pay.  
     REPAYMENTS AND FORFEITURES 
  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Program, a Participant shall reimburse Accenture for the full amount of Separation Benefits received by the Participant under the Program if the Participant subsequently discloses any of Accenture s (or an Affiliate s) trade secrets, violates any written covenants or agreements with Accenture or an Affiliate, including but not limited to non-compete and non-solicitation provisions in any employment or equity agreement, or otherwise engages in conduct that may adversely affect Accenture s (or an Affiliate s) reputation or business relations. In addition, any Participant described in the preceding sentence shall forfeit any right to benefits under the Program that have not yet been paid. Accenture shall take such steps as it deems necessary or desirable to enforce the provisions of this subsection. 
  ADMINISTRATION 
  Accenture is responsible for the administration and operation of the Program.  Accenture is the Program s  plan administrator  and  named fiduciary  (within the meaning of such terms under ERISA).  Accenture may adopt from time to time such rules as may be necessary or desirable for the proper and efficient administration of the Program and as are consistent with the terms of the Program.  These rules will be applied on a uniform basis to similarly situated individuals.  In administering the Program, Accenture shall have the authority, exercisable in its sole discretion, to construe and interpret the provisions of the Program and to make factual determinations thereunder, including the discretionary authority to determine the eligibility of employees (or other individuals) and the amount of benefits payable under the Program.  Any decisions made by Accenture shall be final and conclusive with respect to all questions concerning the Program.  No benefits will be provided to any individual under the Program unless Accenture decides in its sole discretion that the individual is entitled to benefits under the Program.  Accenture may delegate to one or more of its employees or other persons the responsibility for performing Accenture s powers, rights, and duties under the terms of the Program and may seek such expert advice as Accenture deems necessary with respect to the Program. 
  GENERAL 
  Information to be Furnished by Participants  .    Each Participant must furnish to Accenture such documents, evidence, data, or other information as Accenture considers necessary or desirable  

for the purpose of administering the Program.  Benefits under the Program for each Participant are provided on the condition that the Participant will furnish full, true, and complete data, evidence, or other information and that the Participant will promptly sign any document required under the Program or requested by Accenture. 
  Employment Rights  .    The Program does not constitute a contract of employment and participation in the Program will not give a Participant the right to be rehired or retained in the employ of Accenture on any basis, nor will participation in the Program give any Participant any right or claim to any benefit under the Program, unless such right or claim has specifically accrued under the terms of the Program. 
  Decision Final  .    Any interpretation of the Program or any decision on any matter within the sole discretion of Accenture made by Accenture is binding on all persons. 
  Evidence  .    Evidence required of anyone under the Program may be by certificate, affidavit, document, or other information which the person relying thereon considers pertinent and reliable, and signed, made, or presented by the proper party or parties. 
  Gender and Number  .    Where the context permits, words in the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders, the plural shall include the singular, and the singular shall include the plural. 
  Controlling Laws  .    Except to the extent superseded by ERISA, the internal laws of the State of Illinois shall apply to all matters related the Program (including questions of conflicts of law). 
  Interests Not Transferable  .    Except as otherwise set forth in this document, the interests of persons entitled to benefits under the Program are not subject to their debts or other obligations and, except as may be required by the tax withholding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any state s income tax act, or pursuant to an agreement between a Participant and Accenture, may not be voluntarily sold, transferred, alienated, assigned, or encumbered. 
  Mistake of Fact  .    Any mistake of fact or misstatement of fact shall be corrected when it becomes known and proper adjustment made by reason thereof.  A Participant must repay to Accenture any benefits paid under this Program by mistake of fact or law. 
  Severability  .    In the event any provision of the Program is held to be illegal or invalid for any reason, such illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Program, and the Program shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal or invalid provisions had never been included in the Program. 
  Withholding  .    Accenture reserves the right to withhold from any amounts payable under this Program all federal, state, city, and local taxes as shall be legally required, as well as any other amounts authorized or required by Accenture policy including, but not limited to, withholding for garnishments and judgments or other court orders. 

Effect on Other Plans  .    Payments or benefits provided to a Participant under any deferred compensation, savings, retirement, or other employee benefit plan of Accenture are governed solely by the terms of such plan.  Nothing in this Program shall limit Accenture s right to, at any time or for any reason, modify, amend, or terminate any of Accenture s employee benefit or compensation plans, programs, policies, or arrangements. 
  Unfunded Benefit  .    All benefits payable under this Program shall be paid directly by Accenture out of its general assets.  Accenture shall not be required to segregate on its books or otherwise any amount to be used for the payment of benefits under this Program. 
  AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION 
  Accenture reserves the right to amend the Program at any time and to alter, reduce, or eliminate any benefit under the Program (in whole or in part) at any time or to terminate the Program at any time, as to any class or classes of employees (including former employees), without prior notice.  Any amendment of the Program may be made by proper action of an officer of Accenture.  No employee, officer, director, or agent of Accenture has the authority to alter, vary, or modify the terms of the Program, except by means of an authorized amendment to the Program.  No verbal or written representations contrary to the terms of the Program and its proper amendments shall be binding upon Accenture or the Program. 
  BENEFIT CLAIMS PROCEDURES 
  No person needs to apply for benefits under the Program.  However, if a Participant wishes to file a claim for benefits, he or she (or his or her authorized representative) may make a claim by filing a written description of the claim with Accenture.  Accenture will notify the claimant in writing if the claim is granted.  If the claim is denied, Accenture will notify the claimant of its decision, setting forth the specific reasons for the denial, references to the Program provisions on which the denial is based, additional information necessary to perfect the claim, if any, and a description of the procedure for review of the denial.  Any written claim decision will be sent to the claimant within 90 days (or 180 days if extension is warranted by special circumstances) after Accenture received the claim. 
  A claimant may request a review of a complete or partial denial of the claim for benefits.  Any such request must be in writing and must be received by Accenture within 60 days after the claimant received the notice of the denial of the claim.  The claimant will be entitled to review pertinent Program documents and submit written issues and comments to Accenture.  Within 60 days (or 120 days if extension is warranted by special circumstances) after Accenture receives the request for review, Accenture will furnish the claimant with written notice of its decision, setting forth the specific reasons for the decision and references to the pertinent Program provisions on which the decision is based. 
  No person may challenge a decision of Accenture in court or in any other administrative proceeding unless he or she has complied with the claim and appeal procedures described above and such procedures have been completed.  If a claim for benefits is finally denied by Accenture, the claimant may only bring suit in court (or other administrative proceeding) if he or she files such action within 120 days after the date of the final denial of the claim by Accenture.  No  

action at law or in equity shall be brought to recover benefits under this Program until the appeal rights herein provided have been exercised and the Program benefits requested in such appeal have been denied in whole or in part. 
  All decisions and communications to Participants or other persons regarding a claim for benefits under the Program shall be held strictly confidential by the Participant (or other claimant), Accenture, and their agents. 
  RIGHTS UNDER ERISA 
  Each Participant in the Program is entitled to certain rights and protections under ERISA.  ERISA provides that Participants will be entitled to: 
             
    Examine, without charge, at Accenture s offices, all documents governing the Program, and a copy of the latest annual report (Form 5500 series) filed by Accenture with the U.S. Department of Labor and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the Employee Benefits Security Administration. 
                
    Upon written request to Accenture, obtain copies of documents governing the operation of the Program, a copy of the latest annual report (Form 5500 series), and an updated summary plan description.  Accenture may make a reasonable charge for the copies. 
     In addition to creating rights for Participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the Program.  The people who operate the Program, called  fiduciaries  of the Program, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of the Participants.  No one, including Accenture or any other person, may fire any person or otherwise discriminate against a person in any way to prevent him or her from obtaining a benefit or exercising his or her rights under ERISA.  If a claim for benefits is denied, in whole or in part, the claimant has the right to know why this was done, obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules. 
  Under ERISA, there are steps a person can take to enforce the above rights.  For instance, if a person requests a copy of the Program documents or the Program s latest annual report from Accenture and such person does not receive them within thirty days, he or she may file suit in a federal court.  In such case, the court may require Accenture to provide the requested materials and pay such person up to $110 per day until he or she receives the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of Accenture.  If a person has a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, he or she may file suit in a state or federal court.  If it should happen that the fiduciaries misuse a plan s money, or if he or she is discriminated against for asserting his or her rights, he or she may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor or may file suit in a federal court.  The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees.  If a person is successful in the lawsuit, the court may order the person sued to pay these cost fees.  If the person filing the lawsuit loses, the court may order that person to pay these costs and fees; for instance, if it finds the claim to be frivolous. 

If a person has any questions about the Program, he or she should contact Accenture.  If that person has any questions about this statement or about ERISA, he or she should contact the nearest area office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, listed in the telephone directory, or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210.  A person also may obtain certain publications about the rights and responsibilities under ERISA by calling the publications hotline of the Employee Benefits Security Administration.

 A&R ACCENTURE PLC 2010 EMPLOYEE SHARE PURCHASE PLAN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Exhibit 

Exhibit 99.1 
  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
  To the Participants of the Amended and Restated Accenture plc 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan and the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Accenture plc: 
    
  We have audited the accompanying statements of financial condition of the Amended and Restated Accenture plc 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan     (the  Plan ), as of August 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of operations and changes in plan equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2016. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Plan s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Amended and Restated Accenture plc 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan as of August 31, 2016 and 2015 and its operations and changes in plan equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

AMENDED AND RESTATED ACCENTURE PLC 2010 EMPLOYEE SHARE PURCHASE PLAN 
  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

1.    PLAN DESCRIPTION 
  The following description of the Amended and Restated Accenture plc 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan (the  Plan ) is provided for general information purposes. Participants in the Plan should refer to the Plan document for more detailed and complete information. Under the Plan, there are two programs through which participants may purchase shares: (1) the Employee Share Purchase Plan (the  ESPP ) and (2) the Voluntary Equity Investment Program (the  VEIP ). 
  General 
  Under the Plan, which was approved by the shareholders of Accenture plc (the  Company ) at their February 4, 2010 meeting, and approved by the Board of Directors (the  Board ) on December 10, 2009, the Company was authorized to issue or transfer up to   45,000,000   Class A ordinary shares ( Shares ) of the Company. The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the  Committee ), which may delegate its duties and powers in whole or in part as it determines, provided, however, that the Board may, in its sole discretion, take any action designated to the Committee under the Plan as it may deem necessary.  The Company pays all expenses of the Plan. The Shares may consist, in whole or in part, of unissued Shares or previously issued Shares that have been reacquired. 
  At its October 30, 2015 meeting, the Board delegated to the Committee the authority to approve the issuance of an additional   45,000,000   Shares of the Company under the Plan. At its December 4, 2015 meeting, the Committee approved the issuance of an additional   45,000,000   Shares under the Plan, subject to shareholder approval. The Plan was approved by the shareholders of the Company at the February 3, 2016 annual general meeting. 
  The Plan provides eligible employees of the Company or of a participating subsidiary with an opportunity to purchase Shares at a purchase price established by the Committee, which shall in no event be less than 85% of the fair market value of a Share on the purchase date. 
  The fair market value on a given date is defined as the arithmetic mean of the high and low prices of the Shares as reported on such date on the composite tape of the principal national securities exchange on which the Shares are listed or admitted to trading, or, if no sale of Shares shall have been reported on the composite tape of any national securities exchange on such date, then the immediately preceding date on which sales of the Shares have been so reported or quoted shall be used. 
  In general, any individual who is an employee of the Company or of a participating subsidiary is eligible to participate in the Plan, except that the Committee may exclude employees (either individually or by reference to a subset thereof) from participation (1) whose customary employment is less than five months per calendar year or 20 hours or less per week; (2) who own shares equaling 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of shares of the Company or any subsidiary; or (3) who are highly compensated employees under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ). The Plan does not currently qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Code and therefore receipt of the Shares will be a taxable event to the participant. The Plan is not subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. 
  Contributions 
  Payroll deductions will generally be made from the compensation paid to each participant during an offering period in a whole percentage as elected by the participant but not to exceed the maximum percentage of the participant s eligible compensation (or maximum dollar amount) as permitted by the Committee. Under the ESPP, the maximum whole percentage is   10%   (up to a maximum of   $7,500   per offering period), provided that no participant will be entitled to purchase, during any calendar year, Shares with an aggregate value in excess of $25,000. Under the VEIP, eligible participants may choose to contribute up to 30% of their eligible compensation towards the purchase of Shares. The amount of the contributions is based on pre-tax cash compensation, but contributions are deducted from after-tax pay each pay period. Individual participation is subject to an aggregate participation limit as permitted by the Committee. The current aggregate contribution limit percentage is 15% of aggregate global Accenture Leader cash compensation. If aggregate participant contributions are projected to exceed this cap, contributions will stop and participants will be refunded contributions not used to purchase Shares. 
  
   3 

    AMENDED AND RESTATED ACCENTURE PLC 2010 EMPLOYEE SHARE PURCHASE PLAN 
  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS       (continued) 

A participant may elect his or her percentage of payroll deductions, and change that election, prior to the end of the applicable enrollment period as determined by the Committee. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, a participant cannot change the rate of payroll deductions once an offering period has commenced. All payroll deductions made with respect to a participant are credited to the participant s payroll deduction account and are deposited with the general funds of the Company. All funds of participants received or held by the Company under the Plan before purchase or issuance of the Shares are held without liability for interest or other increment   (unless otherwise required by law)  . Under the Plan, the ESPP offering periods in fiscal   2016   included the six-month periods ended   November 1, 2015   and   May 1, 2016  . The current offering period commenced on May 2,   2016   and will end on November 1,   2016  . The VEIP has a calendar year offering period, as well as a limited mid-year enrollment period, and monthly contribution periods in which shares are purchased on the 5th of the subsequent month. 
  Share Purchases 
  As soon as practicable following the end of each ESPP offering period or VEIP contribution period, the number of Shares purchased by each participant is deposited into a brokerage account established in the participant s name. Dividends that are declared on the Shares held in the brokerage account are paid in cash or reinvested. A summary of information with respect to share purchases was as follows:

  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS       (continued) 

As of   August 31, 2016  ,   42,579,575   Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares had been issued under the Plan.

    AMENDED AND RESTATED ACCENTURE PLC 2010 EMPLOYEE SHARE PURCHASE PLAN 
  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS       (continued) 

Withdrawals 
  Each participant may withdraw from participation in respect of an offering period (either current or future) or from the Plan under such terms and conditions established by the Committee in its sole discretion. Upon a participant s withdrawal, all accumulated payroll deductions in the participant s Plan account are returned without interest (to the extent permitted by applicable local law). A participant is not entitled to any Shares with respect to the applicable offering period, except under the VEIP for those shares purchased in contribution periods prior to withdrawal. A participant is permitted to participate in subsequent offering periods pursuant to terms and conditions established by the Committee in its sole discretion. 
  Adjustments 
  The number of Shares issued or reserved for issuance pursuant to the Plan   (or pursuant to outstanding purchase  
  rights  ) is subject to adjustment on account of share splits, share dividends and other changes in the Shares. In the event of a change in control of the Company, the Committee may take any actions it deems necessary or desirable with respect to any   purchase rights   as of the date of consummation of the change in control. 
  Plan Amendment and Termination 
  The Board may amend, alter or discontinue the Plan, provided, however, that no amendment, alteration or discontinuation will be made that would increase the total number of Shares authorized for the Plan   without prior shareholder consent  , or, without a participant s consent, would materially adversely affect the participant s rights and obligations under the Plan. The Plan will terminate upon the earliest of: (1) the termination of the Plan by the Board; (2) the issuance of all of the Shares reserved for issuance under the Plan; or (3) December 10, 2024. The Board has not initiated actions to terminate the Plan, and unless otherwise noted, has not amended the Plan. 
   
  2.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Plan s management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the accompanying financial statements and disclosures. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
  As of   August 31, 2016  , contributions receivable represents payroll deductions from participants with respect to the ESPP offering period beginning May 2,   2016   and ending November 1,   2016  , as well as the VEIP contribution period beginning August 1,   2016   and ending August 31,   2016  .   As of August 31, 2015, contributions receivable represents payroll deductions from participants with respect to the ESPP offering period beginning May 2, 2015 and ending November 1, 2015, as well as the VEIP contribution period beginning August 1, 2015 and ending August 31, 2015.   These payroll deductions are held by Accenture plc and/or its affiliates. 
  Plan equity represents net assets available for future share purchases or participant withdrawals. 
   
  3.    SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
  The Company has evaluated events and transactions subsequent to the Plan s statement of financial condition date. Based on this evaluation, the Company is not aware of any events or transactions that occurred subsequent to the Plan s statement of financial condition date but prior to filing that would require recognition or disclosure in these financial statements.
