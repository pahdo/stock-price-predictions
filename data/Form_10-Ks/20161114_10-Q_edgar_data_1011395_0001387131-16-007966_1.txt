FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT NOTICE 

The statements set
forth in this report which are not historical constitute  Forward-Looking Statements  within the meaning of Section
21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 3b-6 promulgated thereunder, including statements regarding our
expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future. When used in this report, the terms  anticipate,   believe, 
 estimate,   expect  and  intend  and words or phrases of similar import, as they relate to
our business or our subsidiaries or our management, are intended to identify Forward-Looking Statements. These Forward-Looking
Statements are only predictions and reflect our views as of the date they are made with respect to future events and financial
performance. Forward-Looking Statements are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ
materially from any future results expressed or implied by the Forward-Looking Statements. 

Because our common
stock is considered to be a  penny stock , the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995 do not apply to such Forward-Looking Statements. 

Our business involves
various risks, including, but not limited to, our ability to implement our business strategies as planned in a timely manner or
at all; our lack of operating history; our ability to protect our proprietary technologies; our ability to obtain financing sufficient
to meet our capital needs; our inability to use historical financial data to evaluate our financial performance; and the other
risk factors identified in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Because the risk
factors referred to above could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking
statements made by us or on our behalf, readers of this report should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement.
Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we undertake no obligations to update
any Forward-Looking Statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the
occurrence of future events or developments. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which
factors will arise. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor,
or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any Forward-Looking Statements.

Note 1   Basis of Presentation   

The
Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included herein have been prepared by Geospatial Corporation (the
 Company ) in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for
interim financial information and regulations issued pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Accordingly, the accompanying Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements do not include all the information and notes
required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. The
accompanying Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
should be read in conjunction with the Company s Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015.
In the opinion of the Company s management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of the
accompanying Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements have been included, and all adjustments, unless otherwise discussed
in the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, are of a normal and recurring nature. Operating results for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the
year ending December 31, 2016, or any other interim periods, or any future year or period. 

The use of accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

The Consolidated Financial
Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, Geospatial Mapping Systems, Inc. and Utility Services and
Consulting Corporation, which ceased operations in 2011. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 

Note 2   Accrued Expenses

Note 6   Net Income (Loss)
Per Share of Common Stock   

Basic net income (loss)
per share of common stock are computed by dividing earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share reflects per share amounts that would
have resulted if dilutive potential common stock had been converted to common stock. Dilutive potential common shares are calculated
in accordance with the treasury stock method, which assumes that proceeds from the exercise of all warrants and options are used
to repurchase common stock at market value. The number of shares remaining after the proceeds are exhausted represents the potentially
dilutive effect of the securities. 

The following reconciles
amounts reported in the financial statements:

Note 6   Net Loss Per Share
of Common Stock (continued)   

The following securities
were not included in the computation of diluted net loss per share, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive:

Note 7   Stock-Based Payments

on 3,896,000 shares of the Company s common stock were forfeited. 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company granted warrants to purchase 41,226,000 shares of the Company s common stock to consultants
and to lenders in connection with loans to the Company, and warrants to purchase 36,263,440 to the Company s officers in

at $0.01 per share for a term of five years (the  Warrant ). The Company recorded the Warrant on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet as  Additional paid-in capital, warrant  at the carrying value of the Note Payable. 

Note 8   Gains on Extinguishment
of Debt   

Due to significant
cash flow problems, the Company has negotiated concessions on the amounts of certain liabilities and extensions of payment terms.

9   Registration Payment Arrangements    

The
Company is contractually obligated to issue shares of its common stock to certain investors for failure to register shares of
its common stock under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ). The Company has recorded a liability
for the estimated number of shares to be issued at the fair value of the stock to be issued. The Company measures fair value by
the price of its common stock at its most recent sale. The Company reviews its estimate of the number of shares to be issued and
the fair value of the stock to be issued quarterly. The liability is included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet under the heading
 accrued registration payment arrangement,  and amounted to $536,515 at September 30, 2016, and $547,315 at December
31, 2015. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the carrying amount of the liability are included in the Consolidated Statement
of Operations in other income and expense under the heading  registration payment arrangements . During the three

ended September 30, 2016. The Company had losses of $9,720 and $1,190,446 during the three and nine months, respectively, ended
September 30, 2015.  

Note

Stock (the  Certificate of Designations ) with the Nevada Secretary of State, designating 10,000,000 shares of the
Company s undesignated preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, as Series C Preferred Stock ( Series C Stock ).  

The
Series C Stock shall be convertible at the option of the holder, at any time after an amendment to the Company s Articles
of Incorporation is filed and effective increasing the Company s authorized shares of common stock to at least 680,000,000
shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company ( Common Stock ) at a conversion ratio of one (1)

written consent of the holders of not less than a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock to the conversion

750,000,000.  

ITEM 2:  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION   ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Overview 

You should read the following Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) together with our financial statements
and notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with our Annual Report on Form 10-K on April 14, 2016,
and our financial statements and notes thereto as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, which appear elsewhere
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

We provide cloud-based
geospatial solutions to accurately locate and digitally map underground pipelines and other infrastructure in three dimensions.
Our professional staff offers the expertise, ability, and technologies required to design and execute solutions that are delivered
in a cloud-based GIS (geographic information system) platform. 

We believe that the market for aggregating
and maintaining positional data for underground assets is maturing, and that business and governmental entities are beginning to
understand the value of such data. We believe that this developing market presents us with an opportunity to deliver long-term
value to our shareholders. In order to realize that value, our primary challenge is to raise working capital sufficient to operate
our business, and investment capital to hire employees, acquire assets, and expand our business. Management is currently focused
on raising capital, and planning to position our business to capitalize on the maturing market for positional data once such capital
is in place, including identifying new technologies for aggregating positional data, developing our GeoUnderground software, and
planning the strategies and processes for our upcoming marketing campaigns. We use financial and non-financial performance indicators
to assess our business, including liquidity measures, revenues, gross margins, operating revenue, and backlog. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

At September 30, 2016, we had current assets of $271,737, and
current liabilities of $3,193,089. 

Our Company has
incurred net losses since inception. Our operations and capital requirements have been funded by sales of our common and
preferred stock, advances from our chief executive officer, and loans from external sources. At September 30, 2016,
current liabilities exceeded current assets by $2,921,352, and total liabilities exceeded total assets by $2,852,267. Those
factors raise doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

In 2014, we
raised approximately $2.4 million through private sales of our common stock, and approximately $272,000 through the exercise
of outstanding warrants to purchase Series B Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series B Stock ) and common stock. We also
issued common stock for services valued at $82,500, and settled $500,000 of liabilities for shares of our common stock. In
2015, we raised approximately $476,000 through private sales of our common stock, and converted our outstanding
Senior Secured Redeemable Note with a balance due of approximately $1.6 million to shares of our common stock. 

On January 16, 2015, we issued a Senior
Secured Promissory Note to Horberg Enterprises LLC (the  Horberg Note ) in the principal amount of $500,000. The Horberg
Note was due on April 8, 2015, and accrued no interest through the due date. The Horberg Note was secured by liens on all of our
assets. We also issued Horberg Enterprises LLC warrants to purchase 1,500,000 shares of our common stock in consideration for its
purchasing the Horberg Note. Proceeds from the issuance of the Horberg Note were used for working capital purposes. We repaid the
Horberg Note on April 3, 2015. 

On April 2, 2015, we issued a Secured Promissory
Note to David M. Truitt (as amended, the  Truitt Note ) in the principal amount of $1,000,000. The Truitt Note bears
interest at 10% per annum. The Truitt Note is secured by liens on all our assets, and is convertible into shares of our common
stock at a discount to market value at the option of the holder. We also issued Mr. Truitt warrants to purchase 2,000,000 shares
of our common stock in consideration for his purchasing the Truitt Note. Proceeds from the issuance of the Truitt Note were used
to repay the Horberg Note and for working capital purposes. The initial due date of the Truitt Note was October 2, 2015. 

During the first quarter of 2016, we entered
into an Agreement and Amendment with Mr. Truitt pursuant to which Mr. Truitt loaned us an additional $250,000 and extended the
due date of the Truitt Note to July 31, 2016. We issued Mr. Truitt warrants to purchase 25.0 million shares of our common stock
in connection with the Agreement and Amendment. Also during the first quarter of 2016, we designated 10.0 million shares of preferred
stock as Series C Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series C Stock ). Series C Stock is convertible to common stock at
a conversion ratio of 20 shares of common stock for each share of Series C Stock, subject to adjustment for stock dividends, splits,
and similar events. Series C Stock has a liquidation preference equal to its original issue price, and has voting rights equal
to five times the number of shares of common stock into which the Series C Stock is convertible. On March 16, 2016, we sold 1,250,000
shares of Series C Stock to Mr. Truitt for consideration of $250,000. 

During the second quarter of 2016, we sold
1,500,000 shares of Series C Stock to Mr. Truitt for $300,000. Also during the second quarter of 2016, we converted notes payable
totaling approximately $197,000 to shares of Series C Stock, and we converted a note payable of approximately $54,000 to warrants
to purchase common stock. We also converted approximately $1.3 million of our officers  accrued salaries to shares of common
stock, and approximately $162,000 of other liabilities to our officers to shares of Series C Stock. 

On August 12, 2016, we entered into an
Agreement and Amendment with Mr. Truitt pursuant to which Mr. Truitt extended the due date of the Truitt Note to January 31, 2017.
We issued Mr. Truitt warrants to purchase 12.0 million shares of our common stock in connection with the Agreement and Amendment. 

During the third quarter of 2016, we sold
1,375,000 shares of common stock for an aggregate consideration of $100,000. We also received $110,000 for the exercise of warrants
to purchase 1,100,000 shares of common stock, and converted liabilities of approximately $88,000 to approximately 2.8 million shares
of common stock. 

From October 1 through November 10, 2016,
we received $362,000 for the exercise of warrants to purchase 36,200,000 shares of common stock. On November 9, 2016, we repaid
$200,000 of principal of the Truitt Note. 

Management is continuing efforts to secure
funding sufficient for the Company s operating and capital requirements through private sales of Series C Stock and common
stock, and to negotiate settlements or extensions of existing liabilities. The proceeds of such sales of stock, if any, will be
used to fund general working capital needs. 

Beginning in 2012, we changed the focus
of our company to position us to generate revenue from data acquisition and data management. We expanded our service offerings
to provide data acquisition services utilizing twelve different technologies. We developed new, cloud-based mapping software to
be marketed under our existing name GeoUndergound that replaced our previous version of GeoUnderground. We currently utilize GeoUnderground
to deliver data to customers. We intend to offer GeoUnderground as a subscription-based stand-alone product beginning in 2016.
We believe that our changes to our operating focus will enable us to begin to generate significant revenue from operations. 

We believe that our actions and planned
actions will enable us to finance our operations beyond the next twelve months. 

We do not believe that inflation and changing
prices will have a material impact on our net sales and revenues, or on income from continuing operations. 

Results of Operations 

We had sales of $132,371 and $572,371 during
the three and nine months, respectively, ended September 30, 2016. Cost of sales were $54,838 and $185,374 for the three and nine
months, respectively, ended September 30, 2016. Sales were $0 and $20,800 during the three and nine months, respectively, ended
September 30, 2015. Cost of sales were $33,545 and $113,114 during the three and nine months, respectively, ended September 30,
2015. Our sales have fluctuated throughout 2016 and 2015 as our ability to market and perform jobs was hampered by our financial
condition. We expect sales and cost of sales to continue to fluctuate as our business continues to mature. 

Selling, general, and administrative ( SG A )
expenses were $463,657 and $1,240,381 for the three and nine months, respectively, ended September 30, 2016. SG A expenses
were $698,559 and $2,021,897 for the three and nine months, respectively, ended September 30, 2015. The decreases in SG A costs
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were due
to decreases in payroll cost and professional fees due to reductions in staffing and professional services necessitated by our
financial position. 

Other income and expense for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was a net expense of $471,594 and a net income of $21,738, respectively, which included
interest expense of $47,334 and $180,106, respectively, gains on extinguishment of debt of $58,603 and $192,124, respectively,
and gains (losses) related to registration payment arrangements of $(482,863) and $9,720, respectively. Other income and expense
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was a net income of $31,387 and a net income of $1,246,281, respectively,
which included interest expense of $41,794 and $163,709, respectively, gains on extinguishment of debt of $73,181 and $219,544,
respectively, and gains related to registration payment arrangements of $0 and $1,190,446, respectively. 

The increase in interest expense in 2016
was due to interest on the Truitt Note in 2016. 

Gains or expense related to registration
payment arrangements result from a series of Stock Subscription Agreements we entered into in 2009 and 2010 (the  Stock Subscription
Agreements ). We were required to register the shares of common stock sold pursuant to the Stock Subscription Agreements
under the Securities Act. Our failure to register the shares of common stock under the Securities Act timely resulted in our obligation
to issue additional shares ( Penalty Shares ) to investors who purchased shares pursuant to the Stock Subscription
Agreements. We recorded a liability on our books for the value of the estimated number of shares to be issued. We incur losses
on our registration payment arrangements when the estimated number of Penalty Shares to be issued increases, or when the value
of our common stock increases. We record gains on our registration payment arrangements when the estimated number of Penalty Shares
to be issued decreases, or when the value of our common stock decreases. 

During the three months ended September
30, 2016, we had a loss related to registration payment arrangements of $482,863 due to an increase in the value of our common
stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had a gain of $9,720 related to registration payment arrangements due
to a net decrease in the value of our common stock during the nine-month period. We had no gains or losses related to registration
payment arrangements during the three months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we had
gains related to registration payment arrangements of $1,190,446 due to decreases in the value of our common stock and the estimated
number of penalty shares to be issued. We expect that income or expense related to registration payment arrangements will fluctuate
as the price of our common stock and the estimate of the number of Penalty Shares to be issued fluctuate. 

We had no benefit from income taxes during
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, as our deferred tax benefit was completely offset by a valuation allowance
due to the uncertainty of realization of the benefit. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of September
30, 2016. 

Application of Critical Accounting Policies 

We prepare our financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which requires us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions which, in our opinion, are significant to the underlying amounts included
in the financial statements and for which it would be reasonably possible that future events or information could change those
estimates include: 

Registration Payment
Arrangements . We are contractually obligated to issue shares of our common stock to certain investors for failure to register
their shares of our common stock under the Securities Act. We have recorded a liability for the estimated number of shares to be
issued at the fair value of the stock to be issued. We review on a quarterly basis our estimate of the number of shares to be issued
and the fair value of the stock to be issued. 

Realization of
Deferred Income Tax Assets.  We provide a net deferred tax asset or liability equal to the expected future tax benefit or expense
of temporary reporting differences between financial reporting and tax accounting methods and any available operating loss or tax
credit carryovers. At September 30, 2016, we had a deferred tax asset resulting principally from our net operating loss deduction
carryforward available for tax purposes in future years. This deferred tax asset is completely offset by a valuation allowance
due to the uncertainty of realization. We evaluate the necessity of the valuation allowance quarterly. 

Estimated Costs to Complete Fixed-Price
Contracts.  We record revenues for fixed-price contracts under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, whereby revenues
are recognized ratably as those contracts are completed. This rate is based primarily on the proportion of contract costs incurred
to date to total contract costs projected to be incurred for the entire project, or the proportion of measurable output completed
to date to total output anticipated for the entire project. We review our estimates of costs to complete each contract quarterly,
and make adjustments if necessary. At September 30, 2016, we do not believe that material changes to contract cost estimates at
completion for any of our open contracts are reasonably likely to occur. 

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK 

Interest Rate Risk Interest rate
risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a security resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates. We do not
have significant short-term investments. Accordingly, we believe that we do not have a material interest rate exposure. 

Foreign Currency Risk Our functional
currency is the United States dollar. We do not currently have any assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Consequently,
we have no direct exposure to foreign currency risk. 

Commodity
Price Risk Based on the nature of our business, we have no direct exposure to commodity price risk. 

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

The Company maintains disclosure controls
and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in
the United States Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As of the end of the period covered by
this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of Company management, including
the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ) Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e). Based upon, and as of the date of this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded
that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
