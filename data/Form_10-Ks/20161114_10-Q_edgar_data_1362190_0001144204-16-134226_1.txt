NOTE 1: ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

The accompanying unaudited interim financial
statements of AudioEye, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary (collectively, the  Company ) have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities
and Exchange Commission, and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in
the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 30, 2016. 

In the opinion of management, all adjustments,
consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations
for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements that would substantially duplicate
the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 as reported in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K have been omitted. 

Corporate Information and Background  

AudioEye, Inc. was formed as a Delaware
corporation on May 20, 2005. The Company focuses on providing its customers with the most complete and inclusive web accessibility
solution available. The Company s suite of technologies allows its customers to provide their site visitors with an enhanced
web experience. When implemented, the Company believes its solutions offer businesses the opportunity to reach more customers,
improve brand image, and build additional brand loyalty. In addition, the Company s solutions provide organizations with
the ability to comply with internationally accepted web content accessibility guidelines (WCAG) as well as United States, Canadian
and United Kingdom accessibility laws. 

Reclassification  

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified
to conform to the current year presentation. 

Revenue Recognition  

Revenue is recognized when all applicable
recognition criteria have been met, which generally include (a) persuasive evidence of an existing arrangement; (b) fixed
or determinable price; (c) delivery has occurred or service has been rendered; and (d) collectability of the sales price
is reasonably assured. For software and technology development contracts the Company recognizes revenues on a percentage of completion
method based upon several factors including but not limited to (a) estimate of total hours and milestones to complete; (b) total
hours completed; (c) delivery of services rendered; (d) change in estimates; and (e) collectability of the contract. 

The Company had one major customer including
their affiliates which generated approximately 55% of its revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

The Company had four major customers including
their affiliates which generated approximately 43% (21%, 16%, 15% and 11%) of its revenue in the nine months ended September 30,
2016. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company had
three customers representing 24%, 17% and 15% of the outstanding accounts receivable. 

Certain Software as a Service (SaaS) and
website hosting contracts are prepared and invoiced on an annual basis. Any funds received for hosting services not provided yet
are held in deferred revenue, and are recorded as revenue when earned.

         AUDIOEYE, INC.    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    September 30, 2016 (Unaudited)    

Use of Estimates   

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include the fair value of the Company s stock, stock-based compensation,
fair values relating to derivative liabilities, debt discounts and the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets. Actual
results may differ from these estimates. 

Stock based compensation  

The Company measures the cost of services
received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award. For employees and directors, the
fair value of the award is measured on the grant date and for non-employees, the fair value of the award is generally re-measured
on vesting dates and interim financial reporting dates until the service period is complete. The fair value amount is then recognized
over the period during which services are required to be provided in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. Stock-based
compensation expense is recorded by the Company in the same expense classifications in the consolidated statements of operations,
as if such amounts were paid in cash. 

Derivative Instrument Liability  

The Company accounts for derivative instruments
in accordance with ASC 815, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other financial instruments or contracts and requires recognition of all derivatives
on the balance sheet at fair value, regardless of hedging relationship designation. Accounting for changes in fair value of the
derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives qualify as hedge relationships and the types of relationships designated
are based on the exposures hedged. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any derivative instruments
that were designated as hedges. 

On October 9, 2015, the Company issued
convertible promissory notes representing $2,500,000 in aggregate principal together with warrants exercisable for up to 25,000,000
shares of Common Stock. The warrants have a strike price of $0.10 and term of 5 years. In addition on May 9, 2016, in connection
with the sale of the Company s common stock, the Company issued warrants exercisable for up to 1,312,000 shares of Common
Stock. The warrants have a strike price of $0.25 and a term of 5 years. 

In accordance with ASC 815, these outstanding
warrants are deemed to contain embedded derivatives. The value of the derivative instrument will fluctuate with the price of the
Company s common stock and is recorded as a current liability on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The change
in the value of the liability is recorded as  unrealized gain (loss) on derivative liability  on the Consolidated Statements
of Operations. This is a non-cash income (expense) item and is adjusted in the  operating activities  of the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flow. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the derivative liability was stated at $3,648,243 and $439,361,
respectively. The change in fair value of $2,990,096 was driven by the increased value of the Company s common stock in the
period and recorded as the  Loss on change in derivative liability  in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As the warrants are exercised or expire, the derivative liability will be adjusted on
the balance sheet and an adjustment will be reflected in stockholders equity under additional paid-in capital.

Fair Value Measurements  

Fair value is an estimate of the exit price,
representing the amount that would be received to, sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants (i.e., the exit price at the measurement date). Fair value measurements are not adjusted for transaction cost.
Fair value measurement under generally accepted accounting principles provides for use of a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes
inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels:  

Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2: Inputs other than quoted market
prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly, and reasonably available. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions
market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent
of the Company. 

Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflect the
assumptions that the Company develops based on available information about what market participants would use in valuing the asset
or liability. 

An asset or liability s level within
the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Availability
of observable inputs can vary and is affected by a variety of factors. The Company uses judgment in determining fair value of assets
and liabilities and Level 3 assets and liabilities involve greater judgment than Level 1 and Level 2 assets or liabilities. 

In October and November 2015, the Company
issued warrants with an exercise price of $0.10 in connection with a convertible debt instruments. The five year warrants also
contain a provision that the warrant exercise price will automatically be adjusted for any common stock equity issuances at less
than $0.10 per share. The Company determined that the warrants were not afforded equity classification because the warrants are
not considered to be indexed to the Company s own stock due to the anti-dilution provision. Accordingly, the warrants are
treated as a derivative liability and are carried at fair value. 

The Company estimated the fair value of
these derivative warrants at initial issuance and again at each balance sheet date. The changes in fair value are recognized in
earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Operations under the caption  unrealized gain/(loss)   derivative liability 
until such time as the derivative warrants are exercised or expire. The Company used the Black-Scholes Option Pricing model to
estimate the fair value of the dates of issuance, the price of the Company stock ranged $0.031 to $0.058, volatility was estimated
to be 102%, the risk free rate ranged 1.14% to 1.75% and the remaining term was 5 years. 

In April and May 2016, the Company issued
warrants with an exercise price of $0.25 in connection with the sale of Common Stock. The five year warrants also contain a provision
that the warrant exercise price will automatically be adjusted for any common stock equity issuances at less than $0.25 per share.
The Company determined that the warrants were not afforded equity classification because the warrants are not considered to be
indexed to the Company s own stock due to the anti-dilution provision. Accordingly, the warrants are treated as a derivative
liability and are carried at fair value. 

The Company estimated the fair value of
these derivative warrants at initial issuance and again at each balance sheet date. The changes in fair value are recognized in
earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Operations under the caption  unrealized gain/(loss)   derivative liability 
until such time as the derivative warrants are exercised or expire. The Company used the Black-Scholes Option Pricing model to
estimate the fair value of the dates of issuance, the price of the Company stock ranged $0.169 to $0.195, volatility was estimated
to be from 169% to 178%, the risk free rate ranged 1.22% to 1.35% and the remaining term was 5 years. The estimated initial fair
value of these warrants of $218,786 was reclassified from equity to liability at the date of issuance.

         AUDIOEYE, INC.    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    September 30, 2016 (Unaudited)    

At September 30, 2016, the price of the
Company stock was 0.149, volatility was estimated to be 170.52%, the risk free rate of 1.14% and the remaining term ranged from
4.02 to 4.56 years. As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of the warrants was determined to be $3,648,243, resulting in an unrealized
gain (loss) on the change in the fair value of this derivative liability of $351,055 and $(2,990,096) for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 

The following are the Company s assets
and liabilities, measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

There are various updates recently issued,
most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not
expected to a have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

NOTE 2: MANAGEMENT LIQUIDITY PLANS  

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had
cash of $1,494,513 and working capital deficit of $2,742,006, principally due to the inclusion of non-cash derivative liability
recorded in current liabilities. Excluding the derivative liability, the Company s working capital would have been $906,237.
In addition, the Company used actual net cash in operations of $1,711,819 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The
Company has incurred net losses since inception. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to
continue as a going concern. 

In
May 2016, the Company sold shares of common stock and warrants for net proceeds, after commissions and other costs, of approximately
$1,579,082.  It is anticipated that the proceeds from the sale of its common stock and warrants will provide the Company with
cash sufficient to fund operations through May 2017.   

The Company expects that cash used in operations
will decrease significantly over the next several years as the Company executes its business plan. In the event that the Company
is not able to fully achieve its plan, the Company may need to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing. If the
Company is unsuccessful in raising additional financing, it will need to reduce costs and operations in the future. 

Accordingly, the
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplates continuation of the Company
as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement
values. The financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

October 24, 2011, at which time the Company entered into a Termination and Release Agreement ( Release ) with
the third party.  The terms of the Release, among other things, terminated the Investment Agreement between the parties, and
required the Company to issue a Promissory Note to the third-party in the combined amount of principal and accrued interest to

Date. The maximum of $2,500,000 in aggregate principal was sold as of November 8, 2015. In addition, upon the election of any Investor
within the three-year period immediately following the Initial Closing Date, any Investor may purchase an additional Note in the
principal amount equal to 50% of the principal amount of the Notes purchased by such Investor at previous closings (the  Option
Principal Amount ) and an additional Warrant with an aggregate exercise price equal to such Investor s Option Principal
Amount. 

The Notes mature three years from the date
of issuance (the  Maturity Date ) and, until the Notes are repaid or converted into shares of the Company s equity
securities ( Equity Securities ), accrue payable-in-kind interest at the rate of 10% per annum. As described in the
Purchase Agreement, as amended (see below), if the Company sold Equity Securities in a single transaction or series of related
transactions for cash of at least $1,000,000 (excluding the conversion of the Notes and excluding the shares of Common Stock to
be issued upon exercise of the Warrants) on or before the Maturity Date (the  Equity Financing ), all of the unpaid
principal on the Notes plus accrued interest shall be automatically converted at the closing of the Equity Financing into a number
of shares of the same class or series of Equity Securities as are issued and sold by the Company in such Equity Financing (or a
class or series of Equity Securities identical in all respects to and ranking pari passu with the class or series of Equity Securities
issued and sold in such Equity Financing) as is determined by dividing (i) the principal and accrued and unpaid interest amount
of the Notes by (ii) 60% of the price per share at which such Equity Securities are issued and sold in such Equity Financing. The
Notes, if not converted, shall be due and payable in full on the Maturity Date.

         AUDIOEYE, INC.    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    September 30, 2016 (Unaudited)    

The Notes contained customary events of
default provisions. In connection with the issuance of the Notes, on October 9, 2015, the Company entered into a Security Agreement
with the Investors (the  Security Agreement ) pursuant to which the Company granted a security interest in all of its
assets to the Investors as collateral for the Company s obligations under the Notes. As noted below, on April 18, 2016, the
parties agreed to remove the security interest feature from the form of convertible promissory note that may be issued in the future
under the Original Agreement. 

The Warrants are exercisable at $0.10 per
share and expire 60 months following the date of issuance. The Warrants are subject to anti-dilution protection, subject to certain
customary exceptions. 

During 2015, the Company issued notes under
this offering totaling $2,500,000. The fair value of the warrants issued in connection with the notes was determined to be $627,293
and was recognized as a discount to the debt being amortized to interest expense over the life of the loans. During three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016, aggregate amortization (and write-off) of $-0- and $600,301 was recognized against the discount. 

In connection with the transaction, the
Company also entered into amendments to certain agreements. On April 18, 2016, the Company entered into a First Amendment to Note
and Warrant Purchase Agreement (the  Purchase Agreement Amendment ) and an Omnibus Amendment to Secured Promissory
Notes (the  Note Amendment ), which collectively amend that certain Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement dated as of
October 9, 2015 (the  Original Agreement ) and the convertible promissory notes previously issued thereunder to, among
other things (i) remove the right of Anthion Partners II, LLC (together with its affiliates,  Anthion ) to designate
a member of the Board of Directors of the Company; (ii) amend the convertible promissory notes issued thereunder to provide that
if a change of control of the Company occurs prior to the maturity date or an equity financing (as defined therein), the convertible
promissory note shall be repaid in an amount equal to the product of (a) 1.4 and (b) the outstanding principal amount and all accrued
and unpaid interest thereunder; (iii) reduce the conversion threshold in the definition of  qualified financing  under
the convertible promissory notes from $2,000,000 to $1,000,000; (iv) remove the security interest feature from the form of convertible
promissory note that may be issued in the future under the Original Agreement, as amended, and (v) provide for optional conversion
into warrants containing  blocker  provisions ( Special Warrants ) instead of shares upon an equity financing.
The Company also made certain amendments to outstanding warrants to add similar  blocker  provisions. 

On April 18, 2016, the Company issued an
aggregate of 12,834,800 shares of its common stock to the Note holders other than Anthion, and 18,353,310 warrants to acquire its
common stock to Anthion in lieu of common stock. Collectively the common stock and warrants issued were in full settlement of $2,500,000
convertible notes and accrued interest of $119,801. The warrants issued to Anthion are exercisable at $0.001 per share for five
years from the date of issuance. 

At the date of conversion, the Company
determined that the conversion price of $0.84 per share did not exceed the fair value of Common Stock at note inception, therefore
there was no beneficial conversion feature upon conversion of $1,025,000 of convertible notes and accrued interest. However, the
Company determined that the estimated fair value of the 18,353,310 warrants of $3,205,959 exceeded the settlement of $1,541,678
of convertible notes and accrued interest and accordingly recorded a loss of settlement of debt of $1,664,281 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. The Company used the Black-Scholes Option Pricing model to estimate the fair value of the warrants at
the date of conversion using the following assumptions: the price of the Company stock of $0.175, volatility was estimated to be
178%, the risk free rate of 1.24% and the remaining term was 5 years.

NOTE 9: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  

Litigation  

In April 2015, two shareholder class
action lawsuits were filed against the Company and former officers Nathaniel Bradley and Edward O Donnell in the U.S. District
Court for the District of Arizona. The plaintiffs allege various causes of action against the defendants arising from our announcement
that our previously issued financial results for the first three quarters of 2014 and the guidance for the fourth quarter of 2014
and the full year of 2014 could no longer be relied upon.  The complaints sought among other relief, compensatory damages
and plaintiff s counsel s fees and experts  fees. The Court appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel,
and consolidated the actions. A consolidated amended complaint was filed under the caption  In re AudioEye, Inc. Sec. Litigation.
 The Company and individual defendants filed a motion to dismiss.  

On July 25, 2016, in connection with a
voluntary mediation, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle the consolidated actions. The settlement agreement
is subject to definitive documentation, shareholder notice, and court approval. The terms of the agreement include a settlement
payment to the class of $1,525,000 from the Company s insurer, with no admission of liability by any party. In 2015, the
Company paid a deductible under its D O insurance policy in the amount of $100,000 regarding this matter. 

On May 16, 2016, a shareholder derivative
complaint entitled  LiPoChing, Derivatively and on Behalf of AudioEye, Inc., v. Bradley, et al. , was filed in the
United States District Court for the District of Arizona. As a derivative complaint, the plaintiff-shareholder purports to act
on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company's current and former officers and directors (the    Named
Individuals   ).

         AUDIOEYE, INC.    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    September 30, 2016 (Unaudited)    

The Company is named as a nominal defendant.
The complaint asserts causes of action including breach of fiduciary duty and others, arising from the Company s restatement
of its financial results for the first three quarters of 2014. The complaint seeks, among other relief, compensatory damages, restitution
and attorneys  fees. No discovery has occurred. In October 2016, the Company and Named Defendants filed a motion to dismiss,
which remains pending. While the Company believes that its legal defense costs may be reimbursed by the Company s insurance
carrier, no reasonable estimate of the outcome of the litigation, the related legal fees, or the impact on the financial results
of the Company can be made as of the date of this statement. 

On July 26, 2016, a shareholder derivative complaint entitled  Denese M.
Hebert, derivatively on Behalf of Nominal Defendant AudioEye, Inc., v. Bradley, et al. , was filed in the State of Arizona
Superior Court for Pima County. The complaint generally asserts causes of action related to the Company s restatement of
its financial statements for the first three fiscal quarters of 2014.  As a derivative complaint, the plaintiff-shareholder
purports to act on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company's current and former officers and directors (the   Named
Individuals  ). The Company is named as a nominal defendant. The Company understands that the Named Individuals intend
to vigorously defend the lawsuit. While the Company believes that its legal defense costs may be reimbursed by the Company s
insurance carrier, no reasonable estimate of the outcome of the litigation, the related legal fees, or the impact on the financial
results of the Company can be made as of the date of this statement. 

We may become involved in various other
routine disputes and allegations incidental to our business operations. While it is not possible to determine the ultimate disposition

adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.

Intellectual Property  

Our technology development was initiated
at the University of Arizona Science   Technology Park in Tucson, Arizona. In 2006, we received technology development
venture funding from the Maryland Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO), which contributed to the development of our platform
strategy. Beginning in 2009, we engaged in a multi-year technology development program with the Eller College of Management s
Department of Management Information Systems at the University of Arizona.  In connection with our proprietary technology,
our company has been issued a number of U.S. patents in two distinct patent families.  Today, an experienced team of in-house
engineers, designers, and developers in our Atlanta, GA, and Tucson, AZ, offices develop the Company s technology  
software and are actively engaged in the expansion of the AudioEye IP Portfolio. 

Our patented technology was a 2013 Edison
Gold Award winner for innovation in the category of  Quality of Life.  

Our intellectual property is primarily
comprised of trade secrets, trademarks, issued and pending patents, copyrights and technological innovation. We have a patent portfolio
comprised of six patents issued in the United States, we have received a notice of allowance from the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office for a seventh patent, and we have several additional patents that are either pending or are being prepared for filing in
the United States and internationally. 

Our current patented invention relates
to a server-side method and apparatus that enables users to audibly navigate websites and hear high-quality streaming audio narration
and descriptions of websites.  This patented invention involves creating an audio-enabled web experience by utilizing voice
talent and automated text-to-speech conversion methods to read and describe web content. It involves the creation of audio files
for each section within a website, and then assigning a hierarchy and navigation system in line with the website design. 
To implement the system, a script is installed across the pages of the website and, when loaded, it plays an audible
tone upon a user s visit indicating that the website is enhanced with our proprietary technology.  Upon hearing the
tone, a user presses a key on the keyboard to enter the audible website.  Audible narration is played through the user s
computer, reading text and describing non-text information, such as images.  The narration includes menus for navigating the
site which have a hierarchy in line that of the original website.  Users navigate the website menus and move from webpage to
webpage by making keystrokes or using a mouse. 

Our current portfolio has established a
foundation for building unique technology solutions that contribute to the way in which we differentiate ourselves from other competitors
in the B2B Web Accessibility marketplace. We plan to continue to invest in research and development, and expand our portfolio of
proprietary intellectual property. 

Our Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended

Comparative for the Nine Months ended September 30,
2016 and September 30, 2015   

Results of Operations  

Revenue  

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, revenue was $594,237 and $314,146, respectively, consisting primarily of revenues from various levels of licensing,
website design and maintenance. Revenues increased due to a change of marketing focus. 

Cost of Sales  

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, cost of sales was $904,091 and $1,178,388, respectively, consisting primarily of sub-contracting to outside sources,
direct labor and direct technology costs. 

Gross Loss  

An increase in our implementation costs
resulted in a gross loss of $309,854 and $864,242 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Gross
loss decreased as a result of lower implementation costs as compared to the same period in 2015. 

Selling and Marketing Expenses  

Selling and marketing expenses were $510,448
and $747,990 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The decrease resulted from the reduction
primarily in staffing levels. 

21   

Research and Development Expenses  

Research and development expenses were
$255,805 and $293,877 for nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Research and development expenses declined
from period to period and reflect the material completion of our product. 

General and Administrative Expenses  

General and administrative expenses were
$1,894,964 and $4,161,269 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. General and administrative expenses
decreased as a result of employee staff reductions and the associated benefits costs as well as decrease in stock based compensation
year over year. 

Amortization and Depreciation  

Amortization and depreciation expenses
were $428,701 and $396,269 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in expense was primarily
related to added patent costs in later 2015 and 2016. 

Loss on change in Fair Value of Derivative
Liabilities  

In October 2015 and in 2016, we issued
warrants with an embedded reset provisions requiring us to fair value the derivatives each reporting period and mark to market
as a non-cash adjustment to our current period operations. This resulted in a loss of $2,990,096 on change in fair value of derivative
liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. None were issued as of September 30, 2015. 

Loss on settlement of Debt  

In April 2016, we issued common stock warrants
in settlement of convertible debt and accrued interest. As such, we incurred a non-cash loss on debt settlement between the estimated
fair value of the issued warrants and the carrying value of the debt and accrued interest of $1,664,281. 

Interest Income (Expense), net  

Interest income (expense), net during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $(676,181) compared to $3,345 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. For 2016,
Interest expense consists of amortization of debt discounts and interest incurred relating to our issued notes payable, as compared
to interest income of $3,264 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 

Contracts in Process/Revenue Recognition  

Under current accounting procedures, the
Company only recognizes revenue on new contracts for the actual services delivered in the period under the following criteria:
i) the contract has been signed and delivered to the Company; ii) the services have been performed or delivered; and iii) the client
has been billed for the services delivered. The Company does not record deferred revenues for new contracts until the first payment
for services has been received. The Company only records accounts receivable for the amount of revenue recognized as service is
rendered, even if the client has been billed for the entire contract value. The table below summarizes the amount of contract value
in excess of the revenue recognized of $644,334 and the deferred revenue recognized of $445,082, in the amount of $318,824. This
amount is expected to be recognized in future periods. The Company also receives contracts for service hours but whose total contract
value is uncertain. These  fee for service contracts  are recorded in the table below only if the services have been
delivered and the associated revenue has been recognized. 

22   

A summary of our contracts in process is
as follows: 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Working Capital  

The working capital (deficit)/surplus for
the periods ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $(2,742,006) and $913,741 respectively. The decrease in Working
Capital was primarily due to an increase in our non-cash derivative liability, accounts payable, deferred revenue and decrease
in cash. Adjusting for the non-cash derivative liability, Working Capital would have been $906,237 at September 30, 2016. In addition,
the Company used actual net cash in operations of $1,711,819 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company
has incurred net losses since inception. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. 

The Company expects that cash used in operations
will decrease significantly over the next several years as the Company executes its business plan. In the event that the Company
is not able to fully achieve its plan, the Company may need to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing. If the
Company is unsuccessful in raising additional financing, it will need to reduce costs and operations in the future. 

Cash Flows  

We had cash in the amount of $1,494,513
and $1,687,257 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

23   

On April 18, 2016 (the  Initial Closing
Date ), the Company entered into a Common Stock and Warrant Purchase Agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) with
certain investors for the issuance and sale of 11,714,285 shares of common stock of the Company and warrants to purchase up to
an aggregate of 1,312,000 shares of Common Stock, representing up to $1,640,000 of proceeds, in one or more closings within 30
days of the Initial Closing Date (the  Transaction ). The warrants are exercisable at $0.25 per share for five years
from the date of issuance and subject to anti-dilution protection as defined. As of July 23, 2016, the Company had received proceeds,
net of costs, of $1,579,082. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

The discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Preparing financial statements requires our management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates
and assumptions are affected by our management s application of accounting policies. We believe that understanding the basis
and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an understanding
of our financial statements. 

Our critical accounting policies, as described
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, relate to capitalized legal patent costs,
income taxes, goodwill, intangible assets, share-based payments, revenue recognition, and research and other accounting descriptions.
There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk  

Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 ,  as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive
Officer and Principal Financial Officer, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Our management carried
out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.  Based on that
evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective as of September 30, 2016 in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Please refer to our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 as filed with the SEC on July 10, 2015 for a complete discussion
relating to the foregoing evaluation of our controls and procedures. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings  

In April 2015, two shareholder class
action lawsuits were filed against the Company and former officers Nathaniel Bradley and Edward O Donnell in the U.S. District
Court for the District of Arizona. The plaintiffs allege various causes of action against the defendants arising from our announcement
that our previously issued financial results for the first three quarters of 2014 and the guidance for the fourth quarter of 2014
and the full year of 2014 could no longer be relied upon.  The complaints sought among other relief, compensatory damages
and plaintiff s counsel s fees and experts  fees. The Court appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel,
and consolidated the actions. A consolidated amended complaint was filed under the caption  In re AudioEye, Inc. Sec. Litigation.
 The Company and individual defendants filed a motion to dismiss.  

On July 25, 2016, in connection with a
voluntary mediation, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle the consolidated actions. The settlement agreement
is subject to definitive documentation, shareholder notice, and court approval. The terms of the agreement include a settlement
payment to the class of $1,525,000 from the Company s insurer, with no admission of liability by any party. In 2015, the
Company paid a deductible under its D O insurance policy in the amount of $100,000 regarding this matter. 

On May 16, 2016, a shareholder derivative
complaint entitled  LiPoChing, Derivatively and on Behalf of AudioEye, Inc., v. Bradley, et al. , was filed in the
United States District Court for the District of Arizona. As a derivative complaint, the plaintiff-shareholder purports to act
on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company's current and former officers and directors (the    Named
Individuals   ). The Company is named as a nominal defendant. The complaint asserts causes of action including breach
of fiduciary duty and others, arising from the Company s restatement of its financial results for the first three quarters
of 2014. The complaint seeks, among other relief, compensatory damages, restitution and attorneys  fees. No discovery has
occurred. In October 2016, the Company and Named Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which remains pending. While the Company
believes that its legal defense costs may be reimbursed by the Company s insurance carrier, no reasonable estimate of the
outcome of the litigation, the related legal fees, or the impact on the financial results of the Company can be made as of the
date of this statement. 

On July 26, 2016, a shareholder derivative
complaint entitled  Denese M. Hebert, derivatively on Behalf of Nominal Defendant AudioEye, Inc., v. Bradley,
et al. , was filed in the State of Arizona Superior Court for Pima County. The complaint generally asserts causes of action
related to the Company s restatement of its financial statements for the first three fiscal quarters of 2014.  As a
derivative complaint, the plaintiff-shareholder purports to act on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company's
current and former officers and directors (the   Named Individuals  ). The Company is named as a nominal defendant.
The Company understands that the Named Individuals intend to vigorously defend the lawsuit. While the Company believes that its
legal defense costs may be reimbursed by the Company s insurance carrier, no reasonable estimate of the outcome of the litigation,
the related legal fees, or the impact on the financial results of the Company can be made as of the date of this statement. 

We may become involved in various other
routine disputes and allegations incidental to our business operations. While it is not possible to determine the ultimate disposition
of these matters, our management believes that the resolution of any such matters, should they arise, is not likely to have a material
adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
