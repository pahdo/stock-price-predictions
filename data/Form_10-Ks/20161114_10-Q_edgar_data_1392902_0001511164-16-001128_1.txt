NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
 A summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements follows. 
   
  Description of Business  
   
 Endurance Exploration Group, Inc. (formerly Tecton Corporation) (the  Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on January 19, 2006, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hemis Corporation.  On December 1, 2006 Hemis declared a dividend of Tecton shares to all shareholders as of that date and concurrently cancelled its share ownership in the Company.  The effect of this dividend declaration and share cancellation was that Tecton was spun off as an independent company. 
   
 On November 8, 2013, the Board of Directors approved a change of the Company s fiscal year from January 31, to December 31. 
   
 On December 31, 2013, the Company acquired 100% of the membership interests of Endurance Exploration Group, LLC ( Endurance LLC ), a Florida limited liability company, in exchange for 20,550,539 shares of the Company s Common Stock being issued to the former members. Endurance LLC is now a wholly owned subsidiary with its operations being the Company s primary focus. 
   
  Endurance Exploration Group LLC    is engaged in the archaeologically sensitive exploration and recovery of deep-ocean shipwrecks throughout the world. We intend to recover bullion precious metals, numismatic-grade coinage, high-value non-ferrous metals and other valuable cargos from both historic and modern shipwrecks. 
   
 On January 2, 2014, the Company changed its name to Endurance Exploration Group, Inc. 
   
 Our corporate headquarters are located in Clearwater, Florida. 
   
  Principles of consolidation and basis of presentation  
   
 These consolidated financial statements include the assets and liabilities of the Endurance Exploration Group, Inc. (formerly Tecton Corporation) and its subsidiaries as of September 30, 2016.  The acquisition of the membership interests of Endurance LLC and its wholly owned Panamanian subsidiary formed to hold the registry of a research vessel occurred as of the close of its business on December 31, 2013. 
   
 The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ).  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such SEC rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading. It is suggested that these consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, included in the Company s latest Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
   
 In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the financial position at September 30, 2016 and the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been made.  All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated. 

8 

Use of Estimates  
   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
   
  Subsequent Events  
   
 The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the filing of this Form 10-Q, to assess the need for potential recognition or disclosure in this report. Based upon this evaluation, management determined that all subsequent events that require recognition in the financial statements have been included. 
   
  Cash and Cash Equivalents  
   
 For purposes of the Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity date of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 
   
  Fixed Assets  
   
 Fixed assets are stated at historical cost. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method at rates based on the assets  estimated useful lives which are normally between three and ten years.  When retired or otherwise disposed, the related carrying value and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and the net difference less any amount realized from disposition, is reflected in earnings. Leasehold improvements are amortized over their estimated useful lives or lease term, if shorter. Equipment and major overhaul items (such as engines or generators) that enhance or extend the useful life of vessel related assets qualify to be capitalized and depreciated over the useful life or remaining life of that asset, whichever is shorter. Certain major repair items required by industry standards to ensure a vessel s seaworthiness also qualify to be capitalized and depreciated over the period of time until the next scheduled planned major maintenance for that item. All other repairs and maintenance are accounted for under the direct-expensing method and are expensed when incurred. 
   
  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  
   
 The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.  Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending on the nature of the assets. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no impairment losses recognized for long-lived assets. 
   
  Income Taxes  
   
  The Company uses the liability method to record income tax activity. Deferred taxes are determined based upon the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities given the provisions of currently enacted tax laws.  
   
 The accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements uses the threshold of more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination for inclusion or exclusion. Measurement of the tax uncertainty occurs if the recognition threshold has been met. 
   
  Net Earnings (Losses) Per Common Share  
   
 The Company computes earnings (loss) per share by dividing net earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the year. Dilutive common stock equivalents may consist of shares issuable upon conversion of convertible preferred shares and the exercise of the Company's stock options (calculated using the treasury stock method).  As of September 30, 2016, there were 5,574,000 common stock equivalents that were anti-dilutive and were not included in the calculation. Common stock issuable is considered outstanding as of the original approval date for purposes of earnings per share computations.   

9 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  
   
 The fair value of financial instruments, which include cash, loans receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses and advances from related parties were estimated to approximate their carrying values due to the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. Management is of the opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising from financial instruments. 
   
   Comprehensive Income   
   
  The Company records comprehensive income as the change in equity of a business during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. It includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Other comprehensive income (loss) includes foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities. As of September 30, 2016 the Company had no items that represent comprehensive loss and, therefore, has not included a schedule of comprehensive loss in the financial statements.  
   
   Stock Based Compensation   
   
  Stock based compensation costs are measured at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. The Company determines the fair value of awards using the Black-Scholes valuation model.  
   
    New Accounting Pronouncements  
   
 The Company reviews new accounting standards as issued. No new standards had any material effect on these financial statements. The accounting pronouncements issued subsequent to the date of these financial statements that were considered significant by management were evaluated for the potential effect on these consolidated financial statements. Management does not believe any of the subsequent pronouncements will have a material effect on these consolidated financial statements as presented and does not anticipate the need for any future restatement of these consolidated financial statements because of the retro-active application of any accounting pronouncements issued subsequent to September 30, 2016 through the date these financial statements were issued. 
   
  NOTE B   GOING CONCERN MATTERS  
   
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying financial statements for the period January 19, 2006 (date of inception) to September 30, 2016, the Company incurred losses of $6,842,362. The Company has minimal liquid assets. These factors, among others, indicate that the Company will be unable to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. 
   
 The Company's existence is dependent upon management's ability to develop profitable operations and resolve its liquidity problems. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
   
  NOTE C   ACQUISITION OF ENDURANCE EXPLORATION GROUP LLC MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS  
   
 On December 31, 2013, the Company acquired 100% of the membership interests of Endurance Exploration Group, LLC, a Florida limited liability company ( Endurance LLC ) by issuing 20,550,539 shares of its common stock. 

10 

The majority shareholders of the Company also held a majority interest in Endurance LLC, and maintained controlling interests in both entities both before and after the transaction.  Accordingly, the acquisition has been accounted for as a corporate reorganization because of the common control.  The book value of Endurance LLC at the time of the acquisition was as follows: 

NOTE D   PREPAID EXPENSES  
   
 On May 15, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with Eclipse Group, Inc. to provide services, equipment and/or personnel in support of anticipated Endurance salvage projects, to inspect and recover one or more shipwreck cargoes located by Endurance.  The Company issued 2,000,000 common shares at $.25 per share with a value of $500,000.  These shares represent a prepayment for Eclipse services pursuant to a schedule of agreed upon costs and rates.  Eclipse will invoice the Company on a monthly basis as services are rendered.  During the year ended December 31, 2015, Eclipse rendered $150,000 of the services outlined in this agreement.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company has not received any additional invoices for services outlined in this agreement, and consequently the remaining balance of $350,000 is included in prepaid expenses at September 30, 2016. 
   
  NOTE E   FIXED ASSETS  
   
 Fixed assets consist of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Depreciation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $76,864 and $73,686 respectively. 

11 

NOTE F   ADVANCES FROM RELATED PARTIES AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

  On December 31, 2013, as a consequence of acquiring the membership interests of Endurance LLC, the Company assumed a liability of Endurance LLC to Micah Eldred under a demand promissory note, dated June 19, 2012, in the original principal amount of $60,000, bearing interest at 5%.

 On September 3, 2014, the Company entered into a contract with Overseas Marine Vessel Corp, LLC ( OMVC ) pursuant to which it will provide the Marine Vessel Manisee in support of an estimated 10-day mission to investigate, identify and recovery artifacts from one or more shipwrecks located in our search area off the coast of New England.

NOTE I   INCOME TAXES  
   
 There is no current or deferred income tax expense or benefit allocated to continuing operations for the period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company has not recognized an income tax benefit for its operating losses generated through September 30, 2016 based on uncertainties concerning the Company s ability to generate taxable income in future periods.  The tax benefit is offset by a valuation allowance established against deferred tax assets arising from operating losses and other temporary differences, the realization of which could not be considered more likely than not.  In future periods, tax benefits and related deferred tax assets will be recognized when management considers realization of such amounts to be more likely than not. 
   
 For income tax purposes the Company has available a net operating loss carry-forward of approximately $6,800,000 from inception to September 30, 2016, which will expire, unless used to offset future federal taxable income beginning in 2024.  The tax years ending December 31, 2013 through December 31, 2014 are open for inspection by both Federal and State Agencies. 
   
  NOTE J   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  
   
  On October 26, 2016, the Company filed a withdrawal of registration statement on S-1.

  Plan of Operation  
   
 Side-scan sonar survey operations on Project  Connaught  began in July of 2013. Over the course of this initial survey, approximately 700 square miles were digitally mapped. This sonar imagery was then post-processed and evaluated for potential targets. In October of 2014 we positively identified the target of Project  Sailfish,  the Steamship  Connaught  via video and sonar imagery.  We intend to return to the site of the  Connaught  in 2017 to recover its cargo. The cost of recovering the cargo of the  Connaught  is estimated to be $1,200,000.  The Company needs additional working capital to recover the cargo of the  Connaught .  There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in securing additional working capital and therefore cannot represent it will ever be in position to recover the cargo of the  Connaught . 
   
 In November 2013, Endurance LLC entered into a contract with the sovereign government of an island nation in the Indian Ocean. The contract provides us with a three-year period in which to operate within the territorial waters of the nation with full permission to survey for and recover the   Black Marlin   and her silver cargo.  We are currently pursuing an option to extend the existing contract. Net proceeds of our recovery efforts, after payment of the costs to transport, store and insure any recovered items, will be split between us (75%) and the island government (25%).  The cost of finding and recovering the cargo of the   Black Marlin   is estimated to be $2,000,000. The Company needs additional working capital to undertake the search for the   Black Marlin  .  There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in securing additional working capital and therefore cannot represent it will ever be in position to search for and recover the cargo of the   Black Marlin  . 
   
  Results of Operations  
   
 The following information represents our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

15 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   
   
   Revenue   
   
 Since inception through September 30, 2016, we have not generated any revenues.  However, during this period of time, the Company has acquired a ship, side scan sonar, topside computer processing of sonar images and a remotely operated vehicle with cameras that can visually inspect things located by the side scan sonar.  The Company, through contracted personnel, has also developed an operational capability for this ship and its equipment.  The Company can also access, on a contract basis, additional ships, equipment and personnel on a case-by-case basis when needed.  This capability allows the Company to offer aquatic research, survey, inspection and recovery, as well as maritime contract services and consulting to both the public and private sectors that contract for such equipment and services.  As of the time of this filing there are no agreement or contracts for the use of the Company equipment or the services described herein and the Company needs additional working capital to continue to offer said equipment and services.  Therefore, the Company cannot represent that, in the future, it will ever generate revenue from aquatic research, survey, inspection and recovery projects, as well as maritime contract services and consulting. 
   
   Expenses   
   
 We incurred operations and research expenses of $872 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $543,817 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $542,945.  The primary reason for this three month net decrease is due to the decreased spending on salvage operations. 
   
 We incurred marketing and promotion expenses of $9,716 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $21,969 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $12,253.  This decrease is primarily due to an overall decrease in both advertising and printing expenses. 
   
 We incurred general and administrative expenses of $59,910 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $157,023 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $97,113.  This decrease in general and administrative costs is a result of decreased operations. 
   
   Other Income (Expense)   
   
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, other income (expense) consisted only of interest expense of ($750) as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 which had interest expense of ($375). 
   
   Net Losses   
   
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred a net loss of $96,869 as compared to a net loss of $747,751 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
   
   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   
   
   Revenue   
   
 Since inception through September 30, 2016, we have not generated any revenues.  However, as stated above, during this period of time, the Company has acquired a ship, side scan sonar, topside computer processing of sonar images and a remotely operated vehicle with cameras that can visually inspect things located by the side scan sonar.  The Company, through contracted personnel, has also developed an operational capability for this ship and its equipment.  The Company can also access, on a contract basis, additional ships, equipment and personnel on a case-by-case basis when needed.  This capability allows the Company to offer aquatic research, survey, inspection and recovery, as well as maritime contract services and consulting to both the public and private sectors that contract for such equipment and services.  As of the time of this filing there are no agreement or contracts for the use of the Company equipment or the services described herein and the Company needs additional working capital to continue to offer said equipment and services.  Therefore, the Company cannot represent that, in the future, it will ever generate revenue from aquatic research, survey, inspection and recovery projects, as well as maritime contract services and consulting.

Expenses   
   
 We incurred operations and research expenses of $25,767 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $634,908 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $609,141.  The primary reason for this nine month net decrease is a result of the decreased spending on salvage operations. 
   
 We incurred marketing and promotion expenses of $16,403 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $41,535 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $25,132.  This increase is primarily due to a decrease in both advertising and printing expenses. 
   
 We incurred general and administrative expenses of $123,242 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $258,421 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $135,179.  This decrease in general and administrative costs is a result of decreased operations. 
   
   Other Income (Expense)   
   
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, other income (expense) consisted only of interest expense of ($2,246) as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 which had interest expense of ($1,125) offset by other income from a gain on cancelation of debt in the amount of $63,144. 
   
   Net Losses   
   
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred a net loss of $244,522 as compared to a net loss of $946,531 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
   
     Current Liquidity and Capital Resources   
   
 Since inception, we have funded our operations through the sale of equity securities and advances made to us by our officers and directors and their affiliated entities. 
   
 As of September 30, 2016, we had $3,919 in cash.  
   
 Net cash used by operating activities was $184,406 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
   
 There was no cash used by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
   
 Net cash provided by financing activities was $187,500 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which consisted solely of advances from related parties. 

17 

Other Recent Financings  
   
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Endeavour Cooperative Partners, LLC made net advances to the Company in the aggregate amount of $187,500, in order to provide the Company with funds to carry on its operations.  These advances do not bear interest, are unsecured and have no specific terms of repayment.  As of September 30, 2016, the aggregate amount of such advances outstanding was $283,000. Interest has not been imputed on this balance as management has deemed it to be immaterial. 
   
  Future Capital Requirements  
   
 Our current available cash and cash equivalents are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements.  Our capital requirements for 2016 will depend on numerous factors, including management s evaluation of the timing of projects to pursue. Subject to our ability to generate revenues and cash flow from operations and our ability to raise additional capital (including through possible joint ventures and/or partnerships), we expect to incur substantial expenditures to carry out our business plan, as well as costs associated with our capital raising efforts and being a public company. 
   
 Our plans to finance our operations include seeking equity and debt financing, alliances or other partnership agreements, or other business transactions, that would generate sufficient resources to ensure continuation of our operations. 
   
 The sale of additional equity or debt securities may result in additional dilution to our shareholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock, these securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations.  Any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. If we were unable to obtain additional financing, we may be required to reduce the scope of, delay or eliminate some or all of our planned activities and limit our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   
   
   Research and Development   
   
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred research and development expenses of $856 and $0 respectively. 
   
   Application of critical accounting policies   
   
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of our Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on the Company s audited Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and corresponding disclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we continue to evaluate our estimates which in large part are based on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
   
   Inflation   
   
 The amounts presented in the financial statements do not provide for the effect of inflation on our operations or financial position. The net operating losses shown would be greater than reported if the effects of inflation were reflected either by charging operations with amounts that represent replacement costs or by using other inflation adjustments. 
   
   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   
   
 As of September 30, 2016, we had no off balance sheet transactions that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

  Not applicable.  
   
   ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   
   
  As of September 30, 2016, under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in our SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified by the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level.  
   
  There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
