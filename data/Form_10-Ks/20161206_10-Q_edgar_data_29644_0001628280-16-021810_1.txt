NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 
   
  Note 1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Basis of Presentation    The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Donaldson Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP) and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of earnings, comprehensive income, financial position and cash flows have been included and are of a normal recurring nature.  Operating results for the   three   month periods ended   October 31, 2016  , are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for future periods.  The year-end condensed balance sheet data was derived from the Company's audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP.  For further information, refer to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   July 31, 2016  . 
  New Accounting Standards Recently Adopted   In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   (ASU 2015-03), which amended guidance requiring the issuance of debt costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts and premiums. This accounting guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 was applied retrospectively and resulted in a reclassification of   $1.6 million   of debt issuance costs from other long term assets to long term debt on the July 31, 2016 balance sheet.  The balance sheet as of October 31, 2016 is also presented in accordance with the guidance of this new standard.  
  In May 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-07,   Fair Value Measurement (Topic 850):     Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share   (ASU 2015-07), which amended guidance requiring a company to categorize investments for which fair values are measured using the net asset value (NAV) per share practical expedient. ASU 2015-07 also limits the disclosures to investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using the practical expedient. This accounting guidance was effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. ASU 2015-07 will only affect the Company's disclosures in the Annual Report on Form 10-K beginning with the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017. 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,   Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments  , which amends (Topic 805) Business Combinations (ASU 2015-16). This ASU requires that acquiring entities recognize measurement period adjustments in the reporting period the amounts are determined, including earnings adjustments that would have been recorded in previous periods if the adjustments were known at the acquisition date. Acquiring entities are no longer required to retrospectively adjust amounts in comparative periods. The adjustment amounts and reasons are still disclosed. This accounting guidance was effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.  The Company does not expect the application of ASU 2015-16 to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.  
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes   (ASU 2015-17), which amended the guidance requiring companies to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and non-current amounts in a classified statement of financial position. This accounting guidance simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes, such that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current in a classified statement of financial position. This accounting guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this accounting guidance prospectively beginning in the first quarter for fiscal 2017 which affected the Company's classification of deferred tax assets and liabilities at October 31, 2016. Consistent with the prospective method of adopting this new standard, the Company has not reclassified deferred tax assets and liabilities on its July 31, 2016 consolidated balance sheet.   
  New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted   In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   (ASU 2014-09)  ,   which amended revenue recognition guidance to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. The guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also requires expanded disclosures relating to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required about customer contracts, significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract.  In 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-11, and ASU 2016-12 to clarify, among other things, the implementation guidance related to principal versus agent considerations, identifying performance obligations, and accounting for licenses of intellectual property.  This accounting guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of   fiscal 2019  . Early application as of the original date is permitted. The amendments in this update are to be applied on a retrospective basis, either to each prior reporting period presented or by presenting the cumulative effect of applying the update recognized at the date of initial application. The Company is evaluating the impact that this will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  
   6 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,   Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory   (ASU 2015-11), which amended the guidance requiring companies not using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable rather than the lower of cost or market. This accounting guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of   fiscal 2018  . Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the application of ASU 2015-11 to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   (ASU 2016-02), which amends the guidance requiring companies to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than twelve months. The new guidance will require companies to record both capital and operating leases on the balance sheet. This accounting guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of   fiscal 2020   on a modified retrospective basis and early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   (ASU 2016-09). This update simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of   fiscal 2018  . Early application is permitted.  If early adopted, an entity must adopt all of the amendments during the same period. The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)   (ASU 2016-15).  The new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-15 is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of   fiscal 2019  .  Early adoption is permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period.  The guidance requires application using a retrospective transition method. The Company does not expect the application of ASU 2016-15 to have a significant impact on its statement of cash flows as the adoption of ASU 2016-15 will only impact the classification of certain transactions identified in the guidance. 
   
  Note 2.  Acquisitions 
  On August 31, 2016, the Company acquired the net assets of Industrias Partmo S.A. (Partmo) in Colombia. Partmo is a leading manufacturer of replacement air, lube and fuel filters in Colombia for medium and heavy duty engines. The total purchase price was approximately   $12.1 million   of which   $10.9 million   was paid at closing and   $1.2 million   will be paid in equal installments over the next   three   years subject to the satisfaction of certain representations and warranties. The acquisition of Partmo reinforces the Company s commitment to growth with a company that is an excellent strategic fit with its existing engine aftermarket business. The acquisition allows the Company to leverage Partmo s well-recognized brand of replacement filters in South America. The purchase price allocation is  preliminary pending the outcome of the final valuation. Pro forma financial results are not presented as the results of the acquisition are not material to the Company s financial results. 
  During the first quarter of 2017, the Company reached a   $6.8 million   favorable settlement of claims associated with amounts held in an escrow account that had been established in connection with the Company s acquisition of Northern Technical, L.L.C. during the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Because this settlement was related to claims associated with general representations and warranties and occurred subsequent to   one year   after the closing of the acquisition, the Company recorded the impact of the   $6.8 million   settlement as a component of  Other income, net  in its consolidated statement of operations for the quarter ended October 31, 2016. 
   
  Note 3.  Inventories 
  The components of inventory as of   October 31, 2016   and   July 31, 2016  , are as follows (in millions): 

Note 4.  Net Earnings Per Share 
  The Company s basic net earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares.  The Company s diluted net earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares and common share equivalents relating to stock options and stock incentive plans.  Certain outstanding options were excluded from the diluted net earnings per share calculations because their exercise prices were  
  
   7 

greater than the average market price of the Company s common stock during those periods.  For the   three   months ended   October 31, 2016   and   2015  , there were   1.5 million   and   3.4 million  , respectively, options excluded from the diluted net earnings per share calculation. 
  Basic and diluted net earnings per share were calculated using the following (in millions, except per share amounts): 

Note 5.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
  Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired.  The Company performed its annual impairment assessment during the third quarter of   fiscal 2016  . The results of this assessment showed that the estimated fair values of the reporting units to which goodwill is assigned continued to exceed the corresponding carrying values of the respective reporting units resulting in   no   goodwill impairment.   
  The following is a reconciliation of goodwill for the   three months ended October 31, 2016   (in millions): 

As of   October 31, 2016   and   July 31, 2016  , other intangible assets were   $41.8 million   and   $38.5 million  , respectively.  Intangible assets increased during the year due to the acquisition of Partmo which generated intangibles of   $4.9 million  , partially offset by amortization of existing assets of   $1.5 million  , and a   $0.1 million   foreign exchange translation decrease.  The Partmo intangibles acquired consisted primarily of customer relationships with a   20 years   useful life. Refer to Note 2 for further discussion of the Partmo acquisition. 
   
  Note 6.  Warranty 
  The Company estimates warranty expense using quantitative measures based on historical warranty claim experience and evaluation of specific customer warranty issues.  Following is a reconciliation of warranty reserves for the   three months ended October 31, 2016   and   2015   (in millions): 

While the current fiscal year period included increased warranty costs, there were no individually material specific warranty matters accrued for in the   three months ended October 31, 2016   or   2015  .  The Company s warranty matters are not expected to have a material impact on its results of operations, liquidity or financial position. 
  
   8 

Note 7.  Restructuring Charges 
  The Company incurred   $7.5 million   of restructuring charges during the three months ended October 31, 2015 with   $3.2 million   of these charges recorded in Cost of sales and the remaining   $4.3 million   recorded in Operating expenses. These charges consisted of one-time termination benefits from restructuring salaried and production workforce in all geographic regions, closing a production facility in Grinnell, Iowa and the abandonment and write-off of a partially completed facility in Xuzhou, China. As the Company s restructuring actions were mainly incurred and paid in the same period, there was   no   material liability balance as of October 31, 2016. 
   
  Note 8.  Equity Based Compensation 
  Stock-based compensation expense is recognized using the fair-value method for all awards.  The Company determines the fair value of its option awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.  Options granted are priced at the fair market value of the Company's stock on the date of grant.  There were   no   stock options awarded during the   three   months ended   October 31, 2016  . For the   three   months ended   October 31, 2016   and    October 31, 2015  , the Company recorded pre-tax stock-based compensation expense associated with stock options of   $1.1 million   and   $1.1 million  , respectively, and recorded   $0.3 million   and   $0.3 million  , respectively, of related tax benefits.  
  The following table summarizes stock option activity during the   three months ended October 31, 2016  : 

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the   three months ended October 31, 2016   and   2015   was   $3.4 million   and   $1.0 million  , respectively. 
  The following table summarizes information concerning outstanding and exercisable options as of   October 31, 2016  : 

At   October 31, 2016  , the aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and exercisable was   $46.5 million   and   $38.8 million  , respectively. 
  As of   October 31, 2016  , there was   $5.0 million   of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock options granted under the 2010 Master Stock Incentive Plan.  This unvested expense is expected to be recognized during fiscal years   2017  ,   2018   and   2019  . 
   
  Note 9.  Employee Benefit Plans 
  The Company and certain of its international subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans for many of their hourly and salaried employees.  There are   two   types of U.S. plans.  The first type of U.S. plan (Hourly Pension Plan) is a traditional defined benefit pension plan primarily for production employees.  The second is a plan (Salaried Pension Plan) for salaried workers that provides defined benefits pursuant to a cash balance feature whereby a participant accumulates a benefit comprised of a percentage of current salary that varies with years of service, interest credits and transition credits. Effective August 1, 2013, the Company no longer allowed entrants into the U.S. Salaried Pension Plan and employees in this plan will no longer continue to accrue  
  
   9 

Company contribution credits under the plan.  Employees will instead be eligible for a   3.0%   annual Company retirement contribution to their 401(k) in addition to the Company s 401(k) match. The international plans generally provide pension benefits based on years of service and compensation level. 
  Net periodic benefit costs for the Company s pension plans include the following components (in millions): 

The Company s general funding policy for its pension plans is to make at least the minimum contributions as required by applicable regulations.  Additionally, the Company may elect to make additional contributions up to the maximum tax deductible contribution.  For the   three   months ended   October 31, 2016  , the Company made contributions of   $0.6 million   to its non-U.S. pension plans and   $1.1 million   to its U.S. pension plans.  The minimum funding requirement for the Company s U.S. plans for   fiscal 2017   is   $9.7 million  .  Per the Pension Protection Act of 2006, this obligation can be met with existing credit balances that resulted from payments above the minimum obligation in prior years.  The Company plans to utilize existing credit balances to meet the minimum obligation for   fiscal 2017  .  The Company currently estimates that it will contribute an additional   $2.8 million   to its non-U.S. pension plans during the remainder of   fiscal 2017  . 
   
  Note 10.  Income Taxes 
  The effective tax rate for the   three   months ended   October 31, 2016   was   27.3%   compared to   27.9%   for the   three   months ended   October 31, 2015  .  The decrease in the Company s effective tax rate for the   three   months ended   October 31, 2016   was primarily due to a reduction in the Company's tax rate prior to discrete items, which was driven by the permanent reinstatement of the U.S. Research and Experimentation Credit during the second quarter of the prior year and a favorable shift in mix of earnings between tax jurisdictions. 
  The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions.  With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to state and foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2008.  The United States Internal Revenue Service has completed examinations of the Company s U.S. federal income tax returns through 2012. 
  At   October 31, 2016  , the total unrecognized tax benefits were   $16.2 million   and accrued interest and penalties on these unrecognized tax benefits were   $1.9 million  .  The Company recognizes accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.  If the Company were to prevail on all unrecognized tax benefits, substantially all of the unrecognized tax benefits would benefit the effective tax rate.  With an average statute of limitations of about   five   years, up to   $1.3 million   of the unrecognized tax benefits could potentially expire in the next   12   month period unless extended by an audit.  It is possible that quicker than expected settlement of either current audits, future audits or disputes would cause additional reversals of previously recorded reserves in the next 12 month period.  Quantification of an estimated range and timing of future audit settlements cannot be made at this time. 
   
  Note 11.  Shareholders  Equity 
  The Company s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to   14.0 million   shares of common stock on May 29, 2015. During the   three months ended October 31, 2016  , the Company repurchased   1.1 million   shares for   $41.4 million   at an average price of   $36.59   per share.  As of   October 31, 2016  , the Company had remaining authorization to repurchase up to   9.4 million   shares.  
  On November 18, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of   17.5 cents   per common share, payable to stockholders of record on December 6, 2016.  The dividend is payable on December 21, 2016. 
  
   10 

Note 12.  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
  Changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss by component for the   three months ended October 31, 2016   and   2015   are as follows (in millions): 

(a) 
    Taxes are not provided on cumulative translation adjustments as substantially all translation adjustments relate to earnings that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.   
              (b) 
    Primarily includes net amortization of prior service costs and actuarial losses included in net periodic benefit cost (see Note 9) that were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to operating expenses or cost of sales. 
              (c) 
    Relates to foreign currency cash flow hedges that were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to other income, net. 
      
  Note 13.  Guarantees 
  The Company and Caterpillar Inc. equally own the shares of Advanced Filtration Systems Inc. (AFSI), an unconsolidated joint venture, and guarantee certain debt of the joint venture.  As of   October 31, 2016  , AFSI had   $25.8 million   of outstanding debt, of which the Company guarantees half.  The Company recorded   $0.6 million   of earnings and a   $1.2 million   loss from this equity method investment during the three months ended   October 31, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. During the three months ended   October 31, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recorded royalty income of   $1.3 million   and   $1.8 million  , respectively, related to AFSI.  
  As of   October 31, 2016  , the Company had a contingent liability for standby letters of credit totaling   $9.1 million   that have been issued and are outstanding.  The letters of credit guarantee payment to third parties in the event the Company is in breach of insurance contract terms as detailed in each letter of credit.  At   October 31, 2016  , there were   no   amounts drawn upon these letters of credit. 
   
  Note 14.  Commitments and Contingencies 
  The Company records provisions with respect to identified claims or lawsuits when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Claims and lawsuits are reviewed quarterly and provisions are taken or adjusted to reflect the status of a particular matter. The Company believes the recorded reserves in its condensed  
  
   11 

consolidated financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable outcomes. The recorded liabilities were not material to the Company s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity, and the Company does not believe that any of the currently identified claims or litigation will materially affect its financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
   
  Note 15.  Segment Reporting 
  The Company reports its business in   two   segments: Engine Products and Industrial Products.  Segment determination was based on the internal organization structure, management of operations, and performance evaluation by management and the Company s Board of Directors.  Corporate and Unallocated includes corporate expenses determined to be non-allocable to the segments, such as interest income and interest expense.  The Company is an integrated enterprise, characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations, and sharing of assets.  Therefore, the Company does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating profit and other financial information shown below.  Segment detail is summarized as follows (in millions): 

There were   no   customers that accounted for over 10% of net sales for the   three   months ended   October 31, 2016   and   2015  .  There were   no   customers that accounted for over 10% of gross accounts receivable as of   October 31, 2016   and   2015  . 
   
  Note 16.  Fair Value Measurements 
  At   October 31, 2016  , the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivables, short-term borrowings and trade accounts payable approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments and are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. As of   October 31, 2016  , the estimated fair value of debt with fixed interest rates was   $384.3 million   compared to its carrying value of   $375.0 million  . The fair value is estimated by discounting the projected cash flows using the rate that similar amounts of debt could currently be borrowed, which is classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Item 2. 
    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Overview 
  The Company is a worldwide manufacturer of filtration systems and replacement parts. The Company s core strengths are leading filtration technology, strong customer relationships, and its global presence. Products are manufactured at 43 plants around the world and through   three   joint ventures. 
  The Company has   two   reporting segments: Engine Products and Industrial Products. Products in the Engine Products segment consist of air filtration systems, exhaust and emissions systems, liquid filtration systems, including hydraulics, fuel, and lube systems, replacement filters, and filter monitoring products. The Engine Products segment sells to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the construction, mining, agriculture, aerospace, defense, and truck markets, and to independent distributors, OEM dealer networks, private label accounts, and large equipment fleets. Products in the Industrial Products segment include dust, fume, and mist collectors, compressed air purification systems, air filtration systems for gas turbines, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane-based products, and specialized air and gas filtration systems for applications including computer hard disk drives and semi-conductor manufacturing. The Industrial Products segment sells to various industrial dealers, distributors, OEMs of gas-fired turbines, and OEMs and end-users requiring clean filtration solutions and replacement filters. 
  The following discussion of the Company s results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this report. 
   
  Results of Operations 
  Three months ended October 31, 2016   compared to   three months ended October 31, 2015    
  Operating results for the   three months ended October 31, 2016   and   2015  , are as follows (in millions): 

For the   three months ended October 31, 2016  , net sales increased   2.8%   to   $553.0 million   compared with the same period in the prior fiscal year. Sales increased   $7.3 million  , or   2.1%  , in the Engine Products segment and   $7.7 million  , or   4.1%  , in the Industrial Products segment compared with the same period in the prior fiscal year. The impact of foreign currency translation during the   first   quarter of   fiscal 2016   benefited net sales by   0.3%   compared to the prior year. The increase in Engine Products sales was driven by an increase in Aftermarket Products of   6.7%   and Aerospace and Defense Products of   4.2%   partially offset by a   25.8%   decrease in On-Road Products. The increase in Aftermarket Product sales was driven by an increase in sales through both the Company's OE and independent sales channels. In addition, the increase in Aftermarket Product sales included approximately $2.0 million of incremental sales from the Company's acquisition of Partmo and also reflected a recovery from a sharp sales decline in the first quarter of the prior year. On-Road Product sales decreased with a U.S. sales decline attributable to the slowing production of Class 8 trucks. The Industrial Products sales increase was driven by an increase of   34.3%   in the Gas Turbine Systems. Sales for Industrial Filtration Solutions and Special Application Products were approximately flat for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the same period of the prior year. Industrial Filtration Sales were flat compared to the prior year with an increase in replacement parts sales offset by a decrease of sales in first-fit. Special Applications Products sales decreased slightly due to a decline in disk drive sales partially offset by an increase in venting solutions sales. 
  Cost of sales for the   three months ended October 31, 2016  , was   $358.8 million   compared to   $359.9 million   for the   three months ended October 31, 2015  , a decrease of   $1.1 million  , or   0.3%  . The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales  
  
   13 

resulted primarily from higher fixed-cost absorption on a more stable base of sales. Also contributing to the favorability was the absence of any restructuring charges, compared to   $3.2 million   of restructuring related costs in the prior year period. There were no restructuring costs incurred for the three months ended October 31, 2016. 
  Operating expenses were   $117.8 million   for the quarter ended   October 31, 2016  , compared to   $122.6 million   in the prior year period. As a percent of net sales, operating expenses for the current year quarter were   21.3%  , compared to   22.8%   during the prior year quarter. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to approximately   $4.3 million   of costs associated with restructuring actions and $2.6 million of investigation related costs in the prior year quarter. There were no restructuring costs incurred for the three months ended October 31, 2016. The operating expense rate for the current quarter benefited from expense savings from previously taken restructuring actions and expense discipline across the Company, partially offset by increased variable compensation expense. 
  Other income, net was   $8.1 million   for the   three months ended October 31, 2016  , compared with   $2.9 million   in the same period of the prior year. The increase between the current year quarter compared to the prior year quarter was primarily due to a $6.8 million favorable settlement of claims in an escrow account associated with general representations and warranties that had been established in connection with the Company s acquisition of Northern Technical, L.L.C. (the "Settlement") during the first quarter of fiscal 2015. 
  The effective tax rate for the   three months ended October 31, 2016  , was   27.3%   as compared to   27.9%   during the same period in the prior fiscal year. The decrease in the Company s effective tax rate for the   three   months ended   October 31, 2016   was primarily due to a reduction in the Company's tax rate prior to discrete items, which was driven by the permanent reinstatement of the U.S. Research and Experimentation Credit during the second quarter of the prior year and a favorable shift in mix of earnings between tax jurisdictions. 
   
  Restructuring 
  The Company incurred   $7.5 million   of restructuring charges during the three months ended October 31, 2015 with   $3.2 million   of these charges recorded in Cost of sales and the remaining   $4.3 million   recorded in Operating expenses. These charges consisted of one-time termination benefits from restructuring salaried and production workforce in all geographic regions, closing a production facility in Grinnell, Iowa and the abandonment and write-off of a partially completed facility in Xuzhou, China. As the Company s restructuring actions were mainly incurred and paid in the same period, there was   no   material liability balance as of October 31, 2016. 
   
  Operations by Segment 
  Following is financial information for the Company s Engine and Industrial Products segments. Corporate and Unallocated includes corporate expenses determined to be non-allocable to the segments and interest income and expense.  
  The following summarizes net sales and earnings before income taxes for the Engine and Industrial Products segments (in millions):

Engine Products Segment   Following are net sales by product within the Engine Products segment (in millions): 

* 
    Includes replacement part sales to the Company s OEM Engine Products customers. 

For the   first   quarter of fiscal 2017, worldwide Engine Products sales were   $353.9 million  , an increase of   2.1%   from   $346.6 million   in the same quarter of the prior year. This increase was driven  by an increase in Aftermarket Products of   6.7%   and Aerospace and Defense Products of   4.2%   partially offset by a   25.8%   decrease in On-Road Products. Engine Products sales increased 8.6% in Asia and 2.4% in the Americas partially offset by a decline of 2.4% in Europe. The increase in Aftermarket Product sales was driven by an increase in sales through both the Company's OE and independent sales channels. In addition, the increase in Aftermarket Product sales included approximately $2.0 million of incremental sales from the Company's acquisition of Partmo and also reflected a recovery from a sharp sales decline in the first quarter of the prior year. On-Road Product sales decreased with a U.S. sales decline attributable to the slowing production of Class 8 trucks. 
  For the   three months ended October 31, 2016  , earnings before income taxes as a percentage of Engine Product segment sales were   12.8%  , an increase from   10.4%   in the prior year period. The percentage earnings increase for the three months ended   October 31, 2016  , was driven primarily from higher fixed-cost absorption on a more stable base of sales and the impact of restructuring charges included in the prior year period. The prior year earnings before income taxes included restructuring charges of   $5.0 million  .   
  Industrial Products Segment   Following are net sales by product within the Industrial Products segment (in millions): 

For the   first   quarter of fiscal 2017, worldwide sales in the Industrial Products segment were   $199.1 million  , an increase of   4.1%   from   $191.4 million   in the same quarter of the prior year. The increase was driven by an increase of   34.3%   in the Gas Turbine Systems. Sales for Industrial Filtration Solutions and Special Application Products were approximately flat for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the same period of the prior year. Industrial Product sales increased 15.1% in the Americas and 1.7% in Asia partially offset by a decline of 5.9% in Europe. Gas Turbine Systems sales are typically large systems and, as a result, the Company's shipments and revenues can fluctuate from period to period. Industrial Filtration Sales were flat compared to the prior year with an increase in replacement parts sales offset by a decrease of sales in first-fit. Special Applications Products sales decreased slightly due to a decline in disk drive sales partially offset by an increase in venting solutions sales. 
  For the   three months ended October 31, 2016  , Industrial Products' earnings before income taxes as a percentage of sales were   19.2%  , an increase from   12.5%   in the prior year period. The percentage earnings increase for the three months ended   October 31, 2016  , was driven by the $6.8 million benefit from the Settlement as well as benefits of previous restructuring actions and the impact of restructuring charges included in the prior year period. The prior year earnings before income taxes included restructuring charges of   $2.5 million  .

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  During the   three months ended October 31, 2016  ,   $99.7 million   of cash was generated from operating activities, compared to   $57.9 million   in the same period in the prior fiscal year. The increase in cash generated from operating activities of   $41.8 million   was primarily attributable to a   $19.5 million   increase in net earnings and a favorable year-over-year change in accounts payable.  
  The accounts receivable balance as of   October 31, 2016  , was   $415.0 million  , a decrease of   $37.4 million   from   $452.4 million   as of    July 31, 2016  . The decrease is a result of higher revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 as compared to the   three months ended October 31, 2016  . Days sales outstanding was   68   days as of   October 31, 2016   and   July 31, 2016  .  The Company s days sales outstanding is also impacted by the mix of foreign sales, particularly in countries where extended payment terms are required. Days sales outstanding is calculated using the count back method, which calculates the number of days of most recent revenue that is reflected in the net accounts receivable balance. 
  The inventory balance as of   October 31, 2016  , was   $249.2 million  , an increase of   $15.1 million   from   $234.1 million   as of   July 31, 2016   driven primarily by small increases at various distribution locations to meet customer demand with the largest single driver being the addition of $2.8 million from the acquisition of Partmo. Inventory turns were   4.4   times per year as of   October 31, 2016  , compared to   4.5   times per year as of   July 31, 2016  . Inventory turns are calculated  by taking the inventoriable portion of cost of goods sold for the trailing three month period divided by the average gross inventory value over the prior four month period. 
  During the first quarter of   fiscal 2017  , the Company repurchased   1.1 million   shares of treasury stock for   $41.4 million  , made   $12.4 million   in capital investments, paid   $23.2 million   in dividends and completed an acquisition for   $10.9 million  . 
  At the end of the   first   quarter, the Company held   $262.2 million   in cash and cash equivalents, up from   $243.2 million   at   July 31, 2016  . The amount of unused lines of credit as of   October 31, 2016  , was approximately $291.6 million. Long-term debt was   $324.7 million   at   October 31, 2016  , a decrease from   $350.2 million   at   July 31, 2016  . Long-term debt represented   29.3%   of total long-term capital as of   October 31, 2016  , defined as long-term debt plus total shareholders  equity, compared to 31.2% at   July 31, 2016  . 
  The majority of the Company s cash and cash equivalents are held by its foreign subsidiaries, as more than half of the Company s earnings occur outside the U.S. Most of these funds are considered permanently reinvested outside the U.S., and will only be repatriated when it is tax effective to do so, as the cash generated from U.S. operations and the Company s access to liquidity is anticipated to be sufficient for the U.S. operation's cash needs. If additional cash was required for the Company's operations in the U.S., it may be subject to additional U.S. taxes if funds were repatriated from certain foreign subsidiaries. 
  During the quarter, credit in the global credit markets was accessible and market interest rates remained relatively low. The Company believes that its current financial resources, together with cash generated by operations, are sufficient to continue financing its operations for the next twelve months. There can be no assurance, however, that the cost or availability of future borrowings will not be impacted by future capital market disruptions. 
  The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, with the exception of the guarantee of   50%   of certain debt of its joint venture, AFSI, as further discussed in Note 13 of the Company s Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

                 Item 2. 
    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
   
 Repurchases of Equity Securities 
  The following table sets forth information in connection with purchases made by, or on behalf of, the Company or any affiliated purchaser of the Company, of shares of the Company s common stock during the   three months ended October 31, 2016  : 

(1)   On May 29, 2015, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 14.0 million shares of common stock.  This repurchase authorization, which is effective until terminated by the Board of Directors, replaced the existing authority for repurchase of 15.0 million shares of common stock that was authorized on September 27, 2013.  There were no repurchases of common stock made outside of the Company's current repurchase authorization during the   three months ended October 31, 2016  .  However, the "Total Number of Shares Purchased" column of the table above includes   16,300   previously owned shares tendered by option holders in payment of the exercise price of options during the quarter.  While not considered repurchases of shares, the Company does at times withhold shares that would otherwise be issued under equity-based awards to cover the withholding of taxes due as a result of exercising stock options or payment of equity-based awards.

Exhibit 31-A 
  Certification of Chief Executive Officer 
  Pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
    
  I, Tod E. Carpenter, certify that: 
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Donaldson Company, Inc.; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;
