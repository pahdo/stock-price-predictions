ABOUT THIS COMBINED QUARTERLY REPORT 
  This combined quarterly report on Form 10-Q is filed by Extended Stay America, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the  Corporation ), and its controlled subsidiary, ESH Hospitality, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( ESH REIT ). Both the Corporation and ESH REIT have securities that have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), which are publicly traded and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the  NYSE ) as Paired Shares, as defined herein. As further discussed herein, unless otherwise indicated or the context requires, the terms  Company,   Extended Stay,   Extended Stay America,   we,   our  and  us  refer to the Corporation, ESH REIT and their subsidiaries considered as a single enterprise. 
  We believe combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of the Corporation and ESH REIT into this single report results in the following benefits: 

Enhances investors  understanding of the Corporation and ESH REIT by enabling investors, whose ownership of Paired Shares gives them an ownership interest in our hotel properties through ESH REIT and in the operation of the hotels and other aspects of our business through the Corporation, to view the business as a whole; 
                
    Eliminates duplicative and potentially confusing disclosure and provides a more streamlined presentation, since a substantial amount of our disclosure applies to the Corporation and ESH REIT; and 
                
    Creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports. 
     This combined quarterly report on Form 10-Q presents the following sections or portions of sections separately for each of the Company, on a consolidated basis, and ESH REIT, where applicable: 

Part I Item 1   Unaudited Financial Statements. 
                
    Part I Item 2   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
                
    Part I Item 3   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
     As required by Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 810, Consolidations, due to the Corporation s controlling financial interest in ESH REIT, the Corporation consolidates ESH REIT s financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows with those of the Corporation. The Corporation s stand-alone financial condition and related information is discussed herein where applicable. In addition, with respect to other financial and non-financial disclosure items required by Form 10-Q, any material differences between the Corporation and ESH REIT are discussed herein. 
  This report also includes separate Part I Item 4   Controls and Procedures sections and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications for each of Extended Stay America, Inc. and ESH Hospitality, Inc. in order to establish that the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of each registrant has made the requisite certifications and that Extended Stay America, Inc. and ESH Hospitality, Inc. are compliant with Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), and 18 U.S.C.  1350.

1. BUSINESS, ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION 
  Extended Stay America, Inc. (the  Corporation ) was incorporated in the state of Delaware on July 8, 2013. ESH Hospitality, Inc. ( ESH REIT ) was formed as a limited liability company in the state of Delaware on September 16, 2010 and was converted to a corporation on November 5, 2013. On November 18, 2013, the Corporation and ESH REIT completed an initial public offering of   32.5 million   Paired Shares. A "Paired Share" consists of   one   share of common stock, par value   $0.01   per share, of the Corporation, that is attached to and trades as a single unit with   one   share of Class B common stock, par value   $0.01   per share, of ESH REIT. The Corporation owns, and is expected to continue to own, all of the issued and outstanding Class A common stock of ESH REIT, which currently represents approximately   55%   of the outstanding common stock of ESH REIT. Due to its controlling interest in ESH REIT, the Corporation consolidates the financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows of ESH REIT. The term,  the Company,  as used herein refers to the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, including ESH REIT. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company owned and operated   626   hotel properties in   44   U.S. states, consisting of approximately   68,900   rooms, and   three   hotels in Canada consisting of   500   rooms. The hotel properties are owned by wholly-owned subsidiaries of ESH REIT and are operated by wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Corporation (the  Operating Lessees ) pursuant to leases between ESH REIT and the Operating Lessees. The hotels are managed by ESA Management LLC ( ESA Management ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation. The substantial majority of the hotels are operated under the core brand, Extended Stay America. The   three   hotels in Canada are operated under the brand Extended Stay Canada. The brands are owned by ESH Hospitality Strategies LLC ( ESH Strategies ), also a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation. 
  In December 2015, the Boards of Directors of the Corporation and ESH REIT authorized a combined Paired Share repurchase program for up to   $100 million   of Paired Shares. In February 2016, the Boards of Directors of the Corporation and ESH REIT authorized an increase of the combined Paired Share repurchase program from   $100 million   to up to   $200 million   of Paired Shares. The program expires on December 31, 2016. Repurchases may be made at management's discretion from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means (including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans). Depending on market conditions and other factors, these repurchases may be commenced or suspended without prior notice. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Corporation and ESH REIT repurchased and retired approximately   4.6 million   Corporation common shares and ESH REIT Class B common shares for approximately   $42.6 million   and   $27.0 million  , respectively. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   the Corporation had approximately   200.2 million   shares of common stock outstanding, approximately   35.6%   of which were owned by the public and approximately   64.4%   of which were owned by Centerbridge Partners, L.P., Paulson   Co. Inc. and the Blackstone Group, L.P. and their affiliates (collectively, the  Sponsors ) and senior management, including certain directors.  As of   September 30, 2016  , ESH REIT s common equity consisted of the following: (i) approximately   250.5 million   shares of Class A common stock outstanding (approximately   55%   of its common equity), all of which were owned by the Corporation, and (ii) approximately   200.2 million   shares of Class B common stock outstanding (approximately   45%   of its common equity), approximately   35.6%   of which were owned by the public and approximately   64.4%   of which were owned by the Sponsors and senior management, including certain directors.   
    
  As of December 31, 2015, the Corporation had approximately   204.6 million   shares of common stock outstanding, approximately   36.9%   of which were owned by the public and approximately   63.1%   of which were owned by the Sponsors and senior management, including certain directors.  As of December 31, 2015, ESH REIT s common equity consisted of the following: (i) approximately   250.5 million   shares of Class A common stock outstanding, all of which were owned by the Corporation, and (ii) approximately   204.6 million   shares of Class B common stock outstanding, approximately   36.9%   of which were owned by the public and approximately   63.1%   of which were owned by the Sponsors and senior management, including certain directors.   
  Basis of Consolidation 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( U.S. GAAP ), and include the financial position, results of operations,  
  
   9 

     Table of Contents  

comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.  Third party equity interests in consolidated subsidiaries are presented as noncontrolling interests.  Despite the fact that each share of Corporation common stock is paired on a one-for-one basis with each share of ESH REIT Class B common stock, the Corporation does not own the ESH REIT Class B common stock; therefore, ESH REIT Class B common stock represents a third party equity interest.  As such, the rights associated with the ESH REIT Class B common stock, along with other third party equity interests in ESH REIT, which include   125   shares of preferred stock, are presented as noncontrolling interests in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.  Changes in ownership interests in a consolidated subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Interim Presentation   Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company believes the disclosures made are adequate to prevent the information presented from being misleading. However, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended   December 31, 2015   included in the combined annual report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on February 23, 2016. 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal and recurring items) necessary to present fairly the Company s financial position as of   September 30, 2016  , the results of the Company s operations and comprehensive income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and changes in equity and cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Interim results are not necessarily indicative of full year performance because of the impact of seasonal and short-term variations, including the impact of our hotel renovation program. 
  Use of Estimates   The preparation of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management used significant estimates to estimate the useful lives of tangible assets as well as the assessment of tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment, estimated liabilities for insurance reserves and the grant-date fair value of certain equity-based awards. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Property and Equipment   Property and equipment additions are recorded at cost. Major improvements that extend the life or utility of property or equipment are capitalized and depreciated over a period equal to the shorter of the estimated useful life of the improvement or the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are recorded on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives which range from   three   to   49 years  . 
  Management assesses the performance of long-lived assets for potential impairment at least annually, as well as when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of property and equipment is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of a hotel property to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by each hotel property. Impairment is recognized when estimated future undiscounted cash flows, including proceeds from disposition, are less than the carrying value of each hotel property. 
  To the extent that a hotel property is impaired, the excess carrying amount over its estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment charge and reduces income from operations. Fair value is determined based upon the discounted cash flows of the hotel property, quoted market prices or independent appraisals, as considered necessary. The Company recognized an impairment charge related to property and equipment of approximately $  2.8 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and $  9.0 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   (see Note 5). The estimation of future undiscounted cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies upon assumptions regarding current and future economic and market conditions. If such conditions change, then an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of a hotel property could occur in a future period in which conditions change. 
  Segments   The Company s hotel operations represent a single operating segment based on the way the Company manages its business. The Company s hotels provide similar services, use similar processes to sell those services and sell those  
  
   10 

     Table of Contents  

services to similar classes of customers. The amounts of long-lived assets and net revenues outside the U.S. are not significant for any period presented. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  Statement of Cash Flows   In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an accounting standards update which provides additional clarity on the classification of specific events on the statement of cash flows. These events include debt prepayment and extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from settlement of insurance claims, distributions received from equity method investees, and beneficial interests in securitization transactions. The update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods, with early application permitted. The adoption of this update will require cash outflows related to debt prepayment and extinguishment costs to be classified as financing activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, debt prepayment and extinguishment costs included within net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately   $3.9 million  . 
  Compensation Stock Compensation   In March 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, and certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. The update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods, with early application permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this update to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Derivatives and Hedging   In March 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as a hedging instrument does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. The update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods, with early application permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this update to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. 
  Leases    In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which introduces a lessee model that requires a right-of-use asset and lease obligation to be presented on the balance sheet for all leases, whether operating or financing. The update eliminates the requirement in current U.S. GAAP for an entity to use bright-line tests in determining lease classification. The update also requires lessors to increase the transparency of their exposure to changes in value of their residual assets and how they manage that exposure. This update will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, and must be applied using a modified retrospective approach, which will require adjustment to all comparative periods presented. The adoption of this update will require the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease obligation for the Company s ground leases and office lease (see Note 12). As of   September 30, 2016  , the future minimum lease payments under these operating leases totaled approximately   $95.0 million  . 
  Intangibles Goodwill and Other Internal-Use Software   In April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which clarifies the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement. This update provides guidance to customers regarding whether a cloud computing arrangement includes the sale or license of software or, alternatively, the sale of a service. The Company adopted this update on January 1, 2016. The adoption of this update did not have a material effect on the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
     Consolidation Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   In February 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which amends the consolidation requirements under U.S. GAAP, changing the analysis performed by a company to determine whether it has a variable interest in an entity and when to consolidate such entities. The Company adopted this update on January 1, 2016. The adoption of this update did not have a material effect on the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Income Statement-Extraordinary and Unusual Items   In January 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to simplify income statement presentation by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items. The Company adopted this update on January 1, 2016. The adoption of this update did not have a material effect on the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

Contractual Revenue   Since May 2014, the FASB has issued several accounting standards updates which amend existing revenue recognition accounting standards. These updates are based on the principle that revenue is recognized when an entity transfers goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. These updates also require more detailed disclosure to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. These updates are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently assessing the impact these updates will have on its consolidated financial statements.

3. NET INCOME PER SHARE 
  Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of the Corporation s unrestricted common stock outstanding. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders, as adjusted for potentially dilutive securities, by the weighted-average number of shares of the Corporation s unrestricted common stock outstanding plus other potentially dilutive securities. Dilutive securities include certain equity-based awards issued under long-term incentive plans (see Note 13) and are included in the calculation, provided that the inclusion of such securities is not anti-dilutive. 
  The calculations of basic and diluted net income per share, including a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators, are as follows:

  Outstanding Indebtedness 
  ESH REIT Credit Facilities 
  On August 30, 2016, ESH REIT entered into a new credit agreement providing for senior secured credit facilities (collectively the "2016 ESH REIT Credit Facilities") consisting of a   $1,300.0 million   senior secured term loan facility (the "2016 Term Facility") and a   $350.0 million   senior secured revolving credit facility (the "2016 ESH REIT Revolving Credit Facility"). Subject to the satisfaction of certain criteria, borrowings under the 2016 ESH REIT Credit Facilities may be increased by an amount of up to   $600.0 million  , plus additional amounts, so long as, after giving effect to the incurrence of such incremental facility and the application of proceeds thereof, its pro-forma senior loan-to-value ratio is less than or equal to   45%  . 
  Obligations under the 2016 ESH REIT Credit Facilities are guaranteed by certain existing and future material domestic subsidiaries of ESH REIT, other than those owning real property, subject to customary exceptions. Obligations under the 2016 ESH REIT Credit Facilities are secured, subject to certain exceptions, including an exception for real property, by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of ESH REIT and the guarantors. 
    
  The 2016 ESH REIT Credit Facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, limit ESH REIT s ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to incur additional debt, modify existing debt, create certain liens, pay dividends and distributions, make certain investments and other restricted payments, enter into affiliate transactions, amend or modify certain material operating leases and management agreements, sell assets or merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of their assets.

As of September 30, 2016, ESH REIT was in compliance with all covenants under the 2016 ESH REIT Credit Facilities. 
  2016 Term Facility     ESH REIT borrowed   $1,300.0 million   under the 2016 Term Facility upon the closing of the 2016 ESH REIT Credit Facilities. The 2016 Term Facility bears interest at a rate equal to (i) LIBOR (subject to a floor of   0.75%  ) plus a spread which is applicable at such time by reference to the Rating Level Period, as defined, or (ii) base rate (determined by reference to the highest of (A) the prime lending rate, (B) the overnight federal funds rate plus   0.50%   or (C) the one-month adjusted LIBOR rate (subject to a floor of   0.75%  ) plus   1.00%  ) plus a spread which is applicable at such time by reference to the Rating Level Period. Spreads range from   2.75%   to   3.00%   for LIBOR loans and   1.75%   to   2.00%   for base rate loans, and vary depending on ESH REIT's credit rating. The 2016 Term Facility amortizes in equal quarterly installments in annual amounts of   1.0%   of the principal amount outstanding, or   $13.0 million  , commencing on December 31, 2016, with the remaining balance payable at maturity.

   18 

     Table of Contents  

of a transformative transaction) are subject to a prepayment penalty equal to   1.00%   of the aggregate principal amount refinanced, substituted or replaced. Prepayments made after February 28, 2017 are not subject to a prepayment penalty. 
    
  2016 ESH REIT Revolving Credit Facility     ESH REIT borrowed   $50.0 million   upon the facility's closing. The 2016 ESH REIT Revolving Credit Facility provides for the issuance of up to   $50.0 million   of letters of credit. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate equal to (i) LIBOR plus a spread that ranges from   2.25%   to   2.75%   based on ESH REIT s Total Net Leverage Ratio, as defined, or (ii) base rate (determined by reference to the highest of (A) the prime lending rate, (B) the overnight federal funds rate plus  0.50%  , or (C) the one-month adjusted LIBOR rate plus   1.00%  ) plus a spread that ranges from   1.25%   to   1.75%   based on ESH REIT s Total Net Leverage Ratio, as defined. There is no scheduled amortization under the 2016 ESH REIT Revolving Credit Facility and the facility matures on August 30, 2021. 
    
  In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal, ESH REIT incurs a fee of   0.35%   or   0.175%   on the unutilized revolver balance, based on the amount outstanding under the facility. ESH REIT is also required to pay customary letter of credit fees and agency fees. As of   September 30, 2016  , ESH REIT had   no   letters of credit outstanding under the facility, an outstanding balance of   $25.0 million   and available borrowing capacity of   $325.0 million  . 
    
  The 2016 ESH REIT Revolving Credit Facility is subject to a springing financial covenant whereby the senior loan-to-value ratio may not exceed   45%   when the aggregate principal amount of borrowings and letters of credit under the 2016 ESH REIT Revolving Credit Facility, excluding up to   $30.0 million   of letters of credit, is equal to or greater than   25%   of the aggregate available principal amount of the 2016 ESH REIT Revolving Credit Facility on the applicable fiscal quarter end date. 
  ESH REIT Senior Notes Due 2025 
  On May 15, 2015, ESH REIT issued   $500.0 million   of its   5.25%   senior notes due in 2025 (the  2025 Notes ) under an indenture (the  Indenture ) with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee, at   100%   of par value in a private placement pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act ("Rule 144A"). On March 18, 2016, ESH REIT issued an additional   $800.0 million   of the 2025 Notes under the Indenture at   98.5%   of par value in a private placement pursuant to Rule 144A. The 2025 Notes mature on May 1, 2025 and bear interest at a fixed rate of   5.25%   per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year. 
  The 2025 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsecured basis by each of ESH REIT s subsidiaries that guarantee ESH REIT s obligations under the 2016 ESH REIT Credit Facilities. The 2025 Notes rank equally in right of payment with ESH REIT s existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness, and senior in right of payment to all future subordinated indebtedness, if any. The 2025 Notes are effectively junior to any of ESH REIT s secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. 
  ESH REIT may redeem the 2025 Notes at any time on or after May 1, 2020, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to   102.625%   of the principal amount, declining annually to   100%   of the principal amount from May 1, 2023 and thereafter, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Prior to May 1, 2020, ESH REIT may redeem the 2025 Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to   100%   of the principal amount, plus a "make-whole" premium, as defined in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Prior to May 1, 2018, subject to certain conditions, ESH REIT may redeem up to   35%   of the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes at a redemption price equal to   105.250%   of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings, provided   65%   of the original amount of the principal remains outstanding after the occurrence of each such redemption. Upon a Change of Control, as defined, holders of the 2025 Notes have the right to require ESH REIT to redeem the 2025 Notes at   101%   of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. 
  The Indenture contains a number of customary covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, limit ESH REIT s ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to incur additional debt, create certain liens, pay dividends or distributions, make certain investments and other restricted payments, enter into affiliate transactions, sell assets or merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of their assets. As of   September 30, 2016  , ESH REIT was in compliance with all covenants set forth in the Indenture. 
  Corporation Revolving Credit Facility 
  On August 30, 2016, the Corporation entered into a revolving credit facility (the "2016 Corporation Revolving Credit Facility") of   $50.0 million  ;   no   amounts were borrowed upon the facility's closing. The facility provides for the issuance of up to   $50.0 million   of letters of credit as well as borrowing on same day notice, referred to as swingline loans, in an amount up to  
  
   19 

     Table of Contents  

$20.0 million  . Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate equal to (i) LIBOR plus   3.00%   or (ii) base rate (determined by reference to the highest of (A) the prime lending rate, (B) the overnight federal funds rate plus   0.50%   or (C) the one-month adjusted LIBOR rate plus   1.00%  ) plus   2.00%  . There is no scheduled amortization under the 2016 Corporation Revolving Credit Facility and the facility matures on August 30, 2021. 
  In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal, the Corporation incurs a fee of   0.35%   or   0.175%   on the unutilized revolver balance, based on the amount outstanding under the facility. The Corporation is also required to pay customary letter of credit fees and agency fees. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Corporation had   one   letter of credit outstanding under this facility of   $1.8 million  , an outstanding balance drawn of   $0   and borrowing capacity available of   $48.2 million  . 
  Obligations under the 2016 Corporation Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by certain existing and future material domestic subsidiaries of the Corporation subject to customary exceptions. The facility is secured, subject to certain exceptions, by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Corporation and the guarantors. 
    
  If obligations are outstanding under the facility during any fiscal quarter, the 2016 Corporation Revolving Credit Facility requires that the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined, calculated as of the end of such fiscal quarter, be less than or equal to   8.75   to 1.00. The facility is also subject to a springing financial covenant whereby the senior loan-to-value ratio may not exceed   45%   when the aggregate principal amount of borrowings and letters of credit under the 2016 Corporation Revolving Credit Facility, excluding up to   $30 million   of letters of credit, is equal to or greater than   25%   of the aggregate available principal amount of the 2016 Corporation Revolving Credit Facility on the applicable fiscal quarter end date. 
    
  The 2016 Corporation Revolving Credit Facility contains a number of restrictive covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, limit the Corporation s ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to incur additional debt, modify existing debt, create certain liens, pay dividends or distributions, make certain restricted payments, enter into affiliate transactions, amend or modify certain material operating leases and management agreements, merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of its assets. The 2016 Corporation Revolving Credit Facility also contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default. If an event of default occurs, the administrative agent is entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the facility and additional actions that a secured creditor is permitted to take following a default. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Corporation was in compliance with all covenants under the 2016 Corporation Revolving Credit Facility. 
  Unsecured Intercompany Facility 
  On August 30, 2016, ESH REIT and the Corporation entered into an unsecured intercompany credit facility (the "Unsecured Intercompany Facility"), under which ESH REIT borrowed   $75.0 million   from the Corporation upon the facility's closing. Subject to certain conditions, the principal amount of the Unsecured Intercompany Facility may be increased up to an amount that shall not exceed the greater of (i)   $300.0 million   and (ii) an unlimited amount so long as the incremental loan-to-value ratio, determined on a pro-forma basis as of the last day of the most recently ended test period, as if any incremental loans available under such incremental commitments had been outstanding on the last day of such period, and, in each case, without netting the cash proceeds of any such incremental loans, does not exceed   5.0%  . Loans under the facility bear interest at   5.00%   per annum. There is no scheduled amortization under the facility and the facility matures on August 30, 2023. ESH REIT has the option to voluntarily prepay outstanding loans at any time upon   one   business day s prior written notice. 
    
  The Unsecured Intercompany Facility contains a number of restrictive covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, limit ESH REIT s ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to incur additional debt, modify existing debt, create certain liens, pay dividends or distributions, make certain investments and other restricted payments, enter into affiliate transactions, amend or modify certain material operating leases and management agreements, sell assets or merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of their assets.

  All receipts from the mortgaged properties were deposited into a domestic cash management account ( CMA ) for hotels in the U.S. and a Canadian CMA for hotels in Canada. Such CMAs were under the control of the loan service agent and were therefore classified as restricted cash on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.

8. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS 
  The Company from time to time uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risks. The Company s primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of cash flows and earnings associated with changes in interest rates. The Company s derivatives expose it to credit risk to the extent that counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. The Company seeks to mitigate such risks by limiting its counterparties to major financial institutions. In addition, the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored. Management does not expect material losses as a result of defaults by counterparties. 
  In September 2016, ESH REIT entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap at a fixed rate of   1.175%   to manage its exposure to interest rate risk on a portion of its variable rate debt. The notional amount of the interest rate swap as of September 30, 2016 was   $500.0 million  , which reduces by   $50.0 million   every six months until September 2021. The swap is designated and accounted for as an effective cash flow hedge, as the notional amount, interest rate and payment dates in the interest rate swap match those of the hedged cash flows. The fair value of the interest rate swap as of September 30, 2016 was approximately   $(0.6) million   and is reported in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. There were   no   interest rate derivatives outstanding as of December 31, 2015. 

9. MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK 
  The Corporation has authorized   350.0 million   shares of preferred stock, par value   $0.01   per share, of which   21,202   shares of mandatorily redeemable voting preferred stock were issued and outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Dividends on these preferred shares are payable quarterly in arrears at a rate of   8.0%   per year. With respect to dividend, distribution and liquidation rights, the   8.0%   voting preferred stock ranks senior to the Corporation s common stock. Holders of the   8.0%   voting preferred stock are generally entitled to   one   vote for each share and will vote together with the Corporation common stock as a single class on all matters that the Corporation s common shareholders are entitled to vote upon. On or after November 15, 2018, a holder of the   8.0%   voting preferred stock has the right to require the Corporation to redeem in cash the   8.0%   voting preferred stock at   $1,000   per share plus any accumulated unpaid dividends. On November 15, 2020, the Corporation shall mandatorily redeem all of the   8.0%   voting preferred stock at   $1,000   per share plus any accumulated unpaid dividends. 
  Due to the fact that the outstanding   8.0%   voting preferred stock is mandatorily redeemable by the Corporation, it is classified as a liability on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. Dividends on these preferred shares are classified as net interest expense on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
  Fair Value of Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock   As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the estimated fair value of the   8.0%   voting preferred stock was approximately   $21.4 million   and   $21.2 million  , respectively. The estimated fair value of the   8.0%   voting preferred stock is determined by comparing current borrowing rates and risk spreads offered in the market to the stated interest rates and spreads (Level 2 fair value measures). 

10. INCOME TAXES 
  The Company s taxable income includes the taxable income of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and distribution income related to its ownership of approximately   55%   of ESH REIT. 
  ESH REIT has elected to be taxed and expects to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code. A REIT is a legal entity that holds real estate assets and is generally not subject to federal and state income taxes. In order to maintain qualification as a REIT, ESH REIT is required to distribute at least   90%   of its taxable income, excluding net capital gain, to its shareholders each year. In addition, ESH REIT must meet a number of complex organizational and operational requirements. If ESH REIT were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it would be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) and generally would be precluded from qualifying as a REIT for the subsequent four taxable years following the year during which it lost its REIT qualification. Even in qualifying as a REIT, ESH REIT may be subject to state and local taxes in certain jurisdictions, and is subject to federal income and excise taxes on undistributed income. 
  ESH REIT intends to distribute its taxable income to the extent necessary to optimize its tax efficiency including, but not limited to, maintaining its REIT status, while retaining sufficient capital for its ongoing needs. Accordingly, ESH REIT expects to distribute approximately   100%   of its taxable income for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2015, the expectation was to distribute approximately   95%   of ESH REIT s taxable income. As a result of this change, during the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company recognized a benefit of approximately   $(1.8) million   with respect to the reversal of net deferred  
  
   23 

     Table of Contents  

tax liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2015, which represented the previously estimated   5%   of taxable income to be retained by ESH REIT.  
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized a benefit of approximately   $(0.8) million   and   $(8.5) million  , respectively, attributable to a December 2015 statutory law change in the way earnings and profits are computed at ESH REIT. The effect of the change was the reversal of a deferred tax liability related to the Corporation s anticipated receipt of future ESH REIT nontaxable distributions. 
  In January 2016, ESH REIT paid a special distribution of approximately   $86.5 million  . Approximately   $77.4 million   of the special distribution was deductible in 2015; the remaining approximately   $9.1 million   is deductible in 2016. The special distribution is subject to current taxation to the Corporation as a distribution in 2016 at the time of receipt. 
  In   2015  , ESH REIT distributed approximately   95%   of its taxable income and utilized its federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately   $18.6 million  . As a result, in 2015, ESH REIT incurred minimal current federal income tax in the form of alternative minimum tax. 
  The Company recorded a provision for federal, state and foreign income taxes of approximately   $15.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , an effective rate of approximately   21.8%  , as compared with a provision of approximately   $21.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , an effective rate of approximately   26.8%  . The Company recorded a provision for federal, state and foreign income taxes of approximately   $26.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , an effective rate of approximately   16.4%  , as compared with a provision of approximately   $48.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , an effective rate of approximately   24.2%  . The Company s effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate of   35%   primarily due to ESH REIT s status as a REIT under the provisions of the Code. For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company s effective rate was impacted by the approximate   $(0.8) million   benefit discussed above; in addition to discrete provision to return adjustments of approximately   $(2.0) million   recognized upon the filing of an income tax return. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the effective rate was impacted by the approximate   $(1.8) million   and   $(8.5) million   benefits discussed above; in addition to discrete provision to return adjustments of approximately   $(2.0) million   recognized upon the filing of an income tax return and   $0.8 million   of expense related to restricted stock units settled during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  The Company s income tax returns for the years 2013 to present are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities.

  In March 2016, in connection with ESH REIT's     $800.0 million     issuance of its 2025 Notes discussed in Note 7, an affiliate of one of the Sponsors acted as an initial purchaser and purchased     $24.0 million     of the 2025 Notes. As such, the affiliate of one of the Sponsors earned approximately     $0.4 million     in fees related to the transaction for the     nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 

12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

  Legal Contingencies   The Company is not a party to any litigation or claims, other than routine matters arising in the ordinary course of business that are incidental to the operation of the business of the Company. The Company believes that the results of all claims and litigation, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on its business or unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

13. EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION 
  The Corporation and ESH REIT each maintain a long-term incentive plan ( LTIP ), as amended and restated in 2015,  approved by their shareholders. Under the LTIPs, the Corporation and ESH REIT may issue to eligible employees or directors restricted stock awards ( RSAs ), restricted stock units ( RSUs ) or other equity-based awards, in respect of Paired Shares, with service, performance or market vesting conditions. The aggregate number of Paired Shares that may be the subject of awards under the LTIPs shall not exceed   8,000,000  , of which no more than   4,000,000   may be granted as incentive stock options. Each of the Corporation s and ESH REIT s LTIP has a share reserve of an equivalent number of shares of Corporation common stock and ESH REIT Class B common stock. As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   4,052,000   Paired Shares were available for future issuance under the LTIPs. 
  Equity-based compensation expense is recognized by amortizing the grant-date fair value of the equity-based awards, less estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of each award. A portion of the grant-date fair value of all equity-based awards is allocated to a share of common stock of the Corporation and a portion is allocated to a share of ESH REIT Class B common stock. Equity-based compensation expense was approximately   $3.0 million   for each of the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and approximately   $8.6 million   and   $7.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and is included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , unrecognized compensation expense related to outstanding equity-based awards and the related weighted-average period over which it is expected to be recognized subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , is presented in the following table. Total unrecognized compensation expense will be adjusted for actual forfeitures.

     Service-Based Awards 
  The Corporation granted approximately   517,000   service-based awards during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , with a weighted-average grant-date fair value per award of   $14.09  . ESH REIT granted approximately   15,000   service-based awards during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , with a grant-date fair value per award of   $14.08  . The grant-date fair value of awards with service vesting conditions is based on the closing price of a Paired Share on the date of grant. Service-based awards vest over a period of   two   to   four years  , subject to the grantee s continued employment or service. 
  Performance-Based Awards 
  The Corporation granted approximately   166,000   awards with performance vesting conditions during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , with a grant-date fair value per award of   $14.07  . The grant-date fair value of awards with performance vesting conditions is based on the closing price of a Paired Share on the date of grant. Equity-based compensation expense with respect to these awards is adjusted over the remainder of the fiscal year to reflect the probability of achievement of performance targets defined in the award agreements. These awards vest over the remainder of the fiscal year, subject to the grantee s continued employment, with the ability to earn Paired Shares in a range of   0%   to   200%   of the awarded number of RSUs based on the achievement of defined performance targets. As of   September 30, 2016  , all awards with performance vesting conditions are expected to be satisfied at less than   100%   of their target level. 
  The Corporation granted approximately   441,000   awards with market vesting conditions during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , with a grant-date fair value per award of   $12.03  . These awards vest at the end of a   three  -year period, subject to the grantee s continued employment, with the ability to earn Paired Shares in a range of   0%   to   150%   of the awarded number of RSUs based on the total shareholder return of a Paired Share relative to the total shareholder return of other publicly traded lodging companies identified in the award agreements. The grant-date fair value of awards with market vesting conditions is based on an independent third-party valuation. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the grant-date fair value of awards with market vesting conditions was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model with the following key assumptions:  

14. DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS 
  ESA Management has a savings plan that qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Code for all employees meeting the eligibility requirements of the plan. Through December 31, 2015, the plan had an employer-matching contribution of   50%   of the first   6%   of an employee s contribution, which vested over an employee s initial   five  -year service period. For the period from January 1, 2016 through September 9, 2016, the plan had an employer-matching contribution of   100%   of the first   3%   of an employee's contribution and   50%   of the next   2%   of an employee's contribution, which vested immediately. The plan also

provides for contributions up to   100%   of eligible employee pretax salary, subject to the Code s annual deferral limit of   $18,000   during   2016   and   2015  . Employer contributions, net of forfeitures, totaled approximately   $0.8 million   and   $0.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and approximately   $2.6 million   and   $1.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Effective June 9, 2016, ESA Management established a non-qualified deferred compensation plan to allow certain eligible employees an option to defer a portion of their compensation on a tax-deferred basis. At this time, ESA Management does not offer a matching contribution. The plan is fully funded in a Rabbi Trust, which is subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency, but the assets held in the Rabbi Trust are not available for general corporate purposes. As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $0.1 million   was deferred.   

15. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
  On October 4, 2016, certain selling stockholders (the "Selling Stockholders") sold     13.0 million     Paired Shares as part of a secondary offering.     The Selling Shareholders consisted solely of entities affiliated with the Sponsors and did not include officers or directors of the Corporation or ESH REIT. Neither the Corporation nor ESH REIT sold Paired Shares in the secondary offering and neither received proceeds from the secondary offering. The Corporation and ESH REIT did, however, incur professional fees in connection with the secondary offering. For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , total incurred expenses were approximately   $0.4 million  . 
  In connection with the secondary offering, and also on October 4, 2016, the Corporation and ESH REIT repurchased   1.95 million   Corporation common shares and ESH REIT Class B common shares from the Selling Stockholders for approximately   $17.1 million   and   $10.5 million  , respectively, pursuant to that certain share repurchase agreement, dated September 26, 2016, by and among the Corporation and ESH REIT and the Selling Stockholders. The share repurchase was funded from cash on hand. After completion of these transactions, the Sponsors owned approximately   57.0%   of the total Paired Shares outstanding. 
  On   October 6, 2016  , ESH REIT executed a purchase and sale agreement to divest   one   property for approximately $  44.8 million  . The Company expects to lease and continue to operate the property for   18   to   24   months and expects to receive all operating income from this hotel in 2017. This transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions.  
  On   October 21, 2016  , the Corporation and ESH REIT executed a purchase and sale agreement to divest   three   Extended Stay Canada hotels for $  76.0 million   Canadian dollars. This transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions. Upon or prior to closing, approximately   $12.9 million   of foreign currency translation loss included in accumulated other comprehensive loss and noncontrolling interests on the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of changes in equity as of September 30, 2016 will be recorded as a charge against earnings. 
  On   October 25, 2016  , the Board of Directors of the Corporation declared a cash distribution of   $0.16   per share for the   third   quarter of   2016   on its common stock. The distribution is payable on   November 22, 2016   to shareholders of record as of   November 8, 2016  . Also on   October 25, 2016  , the Board of Directors of ESH REIT declared a cash distribution of   $0.03   per share for the   third   quarter of   2016   on its Class A and Class B common stock. This distribution is also payable on   November 22, 2016   to shareholders of record as of   November 8, 2016  .

1. BUSINESS, ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION 
  ESH Hospitality, Inc. ( ESH REIT ) was formed as a limited liability company in the state of Delaware on September 16, 2010 and was converted to a corporation on November 5, 2013. Extended Stay America, Inc. (the  Corporation ) was incorporated in the state of Delaware on July 8, 2013. On November 18, 2013, the Corporation and ESH REIT completed an initial public offering of   32.5 million   Paired Shares. A "Paired Share" consists of   one   share of common stock, par value   $0.01   per share, of the Corporation, that is attached to and trades as a single unit with   one   share of Class B common stock, par value   $0.01   per share, of ESH REIT. The Corporation owns, and is expected to continue to own, all of the issued and outstanding Class A common stock of ESH REIT, which currently represents approximately   55%   of the outstanding common stock of ESH REIT. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , ESH REIT and its subsidiaries owned   626   hotel properties in   44   U.S. states, consisting of approximately   68,900   rooms, and   three   hotels in Canada consisting of   500   rooms. The hotels are operated by wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Corporation (the  Operating Lessees ) pursuant to leases between ESH REIT and the Operating Lessees. The hotels are managed by ESA Management LLC ( ESA Management ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation. The substantial majority of the hotels are operated under the core brand, Extended Stay America. The   three   hotels in Canada are operated under the brand Extended Stay Canada. The brands are owned by ESH Hospitality Strategies LLC ( ESH Strategies ), also a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation. 
  In December 2015, the Boards of Directors of the Corporation and ESH REIT authorized a combined Paired Share repurchase program for up to   $100 million   of Paired Shares. In February 2016, the Boards of Directors of the Corporation and ESH REIT authorized an increase of the combined Paired Share repurchase program from   $100 million   to up to   $200 million   of Paired Shares. The program expires on December 31, 2016. Repurchases may be made at management's discretion from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means (including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans). Depending on market conditions and other factors, these repurchases may be commenced or suspended without prior notice. As of   September 30, 2016  , ESH REIT repurchased and retired approximately   4.6 million   ESH REIT Class B common shares for approximately   $27.0 million  .  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , ESH REIT s common equity consisted of the following: (i) approximately   250.5 million   shares of Class A common stock outstanding (approximately   55%   of its common equity), all of which were owned by the Corporation, and (ii) approximately   200.2 million   shares of Class B common stock outstanding (approximately   45%   of its common equity), approximately   35.6%   of which were owned by the public and approximately   64.4%   of which were owned by Centerbridge Partners, L.P., Paulson   Co. Inc. and the Blackstone Group, L.P. and their affiliates (collectively, the  Sponsors ) and senior management, including certain directors. 
    As of December 31, 2015, ESH REIT s common equity consisted of the following: (i) approximately   250.5 million   shares of Class A common stock outstanding, all of which were owned by the Corporation, and (ii) approximately   204.6 million   shares of Class B common stock outstanding, approximately   36.9%   of which were owned by the public and approximately   63.1%   of which were owned by the Sponsors and senior management, including certain directors.   
  Basis of Consolidation 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( U.S. GAAP ). All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Interim Presentation   Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. ESH REIT believes the disclosures made are adequate to prevent the information presented from being misleading. However, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited  
  
   34 

     Table of Contents  

consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended   December 31, 2015   included in the combined annual report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on February 23, 2016. 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal and recurring items) necessary to present fairly ESH REIT s financial position as of   September 30, 2016  , the results of ESH REIT s operations and comprehensive income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and changes in equity and cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Interim results are not necessarily indicative of full year performance because of the impact of accounting for contingent rental payments under lease arrangements. 
  Use of Estimates   The preparation of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management used significant estimates to estimate the useful lives of tangible assets as well as the assessment of tangible assets and goodwill for impairment and estimated liabilities for insurance reserves. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Property and Equipment   Property and equipment additions are recorded at cost. Major improvements that extend the life or utility of property or equipment are capitalized and depreciated over a period equal to the shorter of the estimated useful life of the improvement or the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are recorded on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives which range from   three   to   49 years  . 
  Management assesses the performance of long-lived assets for potential impairment at least annually, as well as when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of a group of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of property and equipment is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of a group of hotel properties (groups of hotel properties align with hotels as they are grouped under ESH REIT s operating leases) to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by each group of hotel properties. Impairment is recognized when estimated future undiscounted cash flows, including proceeds from disposition, are less than the carrying value of each group of hotel properties. 
  To the extent that a group of hotel properties is impaired, their excess carrying amount over their estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment charge and reduces income from operations. Fair value is determined based upon the discounted cash flows of a group of hotel properties, quoted market prices or independent appraisals, as considered necessary. No impairment charges were recognized during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015   (see Note 5). The estimation of future undiscounted cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies upon assumptions regarding current and future economic and market conditions. If such conditions change, then an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of a group of hotel properties could occur in a future period in which conditions change. 
  Revenue Recognition   ESH REIT s sole source of revenues is rental revenue derived from leases with the Operating Lessees. ESH REIT records rental revenues on a straight-line basis as they are earned during the lease terms. Rents receivable from Extended Stay America, Inc. on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets represent rental amounts contractually due from the Operating Lessees. Deferred rents receivable from Extended Stay America, Inc. on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets represent the cumulative difference between straight-line rental revenues recognized and rental revenues contractually due. As scheduled rent payments begin to exceed straight-line rental revenue, this amount, approximately   $40.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , will gradually decrease through the remainder of the lease terms until it is zero at the end of the lease terms in October 2018. Lease rental payments received prior to rendering services are included in unearned rental revenues from Extended Stay America, Inc. on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. Contingent rental revenues, specifically percentage rental revenues related to hotel revenues of the Operating Lessees, are recognized when such amounts are fixed and determinable (i.e., only when percentage rental revenue thresholds have been achieved). 
  Segments   ESH REIT s business represents a single operating segment based on the way ESH REIT manages its business. ESH REIT s hotels provide similar services, use similar processes to sell those services and sell those services (i.e., lease the hotel properties) to similar classes of customers. The amounts of long-lived assets and net revenues outside the U.S. are not significant for any period presented.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  Statement of Cash Flows   In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an accounting standards update which provides additional clarity on the classification of specific events on the statement of cash flows. These events include debt prepayment and extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from settlement of insurance claims, distributions received from equity method investees, and beneficial interests in securitization transactions. The update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods, with early application permitted. The adoption of this update will require cash outflows related to debt prepayment and extinguishment costs to be classified as financing activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, debt prepayment and extinguishment costs included within net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately   $3.9 million  . 
    
  Compensation Stock Compensation   In March 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, and certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. The update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods, with early application permitted. ESH REIT does not expect the adoption of this update to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Derivatives and Hedging   In March 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as a hedging instrument does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. The update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods, with early application permitted. ESH REIT does not expect the adoption of this update to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. 
  Leases    In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which introduces a lessee model that requires a right-of-use asset and lease obligation to be presented on the balance sheet for all leases, whether operating or financing. The update eliminates the requirement in current U.S. GAAP for an entity to use bright-line tests in determining lease classification. The update also requires lessors to increase the transparency of their exposure to changes in value of their residual assets and how they manage that exposure. This update will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, and must be applied using a modified retrospective approach, which will require adjustment to all comparative periods presented. The adoption of this update will require the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease obligation for ESH REIT s ground leases (see Note 10). As of   September 30, 2016  , the future minimum lease payments under these operating leases totaled approximately   $84.9 million  . 
  Intangibles Goodwill and Other Internal-Use Software   In April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which clarifies the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement. This update provides guidance to customers regarding whether a cloud computing arrangement includes the sale or license of software or, alternatively, the sale of a service. ESH REIT adopted this update on January 1, 2016. The adoption of this update did not have a material effect on ESH REIT s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
     Consolidation Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   In February 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which amends the consolidation requirements under U.S. GAAP, changing the analysis performed by a company to determine whether it has a variable interest in an entity and when to consolidate such entities. ESH REIT adopted this update on January 1, 2016. The adoption of this update did not have a material effect on ESH REIT s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Income Statement-Extraordinary and Unusual Items   In January 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to simplify income statement presentation by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items. ESH REIT adopted this update on January 1, 2016. The adoption of this update did not have a material effect on ESH REIT s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

3. NET INCOME PER SHARE 
  Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income available to Class A and Class B common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of ESH REIT s unrestricted Class A and Class B common stock outstanding, respectively. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income available to Class A and Class B common shareholders, as adjusted for potentially dilutive securities, by the weighted-average number of shares of ESH REIT s unrestricted Class A and Class B common stock outstanding, respectively, plus other potentially dilutive securities. Dilutive securities include certain equity-based awards issued under long-term incentive plans (see Note 11) and are included in the calculation, provided that the inclusion of such securities is not anti-dilutive. 
  The calculations of basic and diluted net income per share, including a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators, are as follows:

4. HOTEL DISPOSITIONS 
  On December 8, 2015, ESH REIT sold a portfolio of   53   hotel properties,   47   of which operated under the Crossland Economy Studios brand and   six   of which operated under the Extended Stay America brand, for gross proceeds of   $273.0 million  . ESH REIT's carrying value of the portfolio, including net working capital and approximately   $2.1 million   of allocable goodwill, was approximately   $148.4 million  , resulting in a gain, net of closing costs and adjustments, of approximately   $116.6 million  , which was reported in gain on sale of hotel properties in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015. This disposition was not reported as a discontinued operation. 
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , these hotel properties contributed rental revenues, total operating expenses and income before income tax expense as follows (in thousands):

7. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS 
  ESH REIT from time to time uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risks. ESH REIT s primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of cash flows and earnings associated with changes in interest rates. ESH REIT s derivatives expose it to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. ESH REIT seeks to mitigate such risks by limiting its counterparties to major financial institutions. In addition, the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored. Management does not expect material losses as a result of defaults by counterparties. 
  In September 2016, ESH REIT entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap at a fixed rate of   1.175%   to manage its exposure to interest rate risk on a portion of its variable rate debt. The notional amount of the interest rate swap as of September 30, 2016 was   $500.0 million  , which reduces by   $50.0 million   every six months until September 2021. The swap is designated

     Table of Contents  

and accounted for as an effective cash flow hedge, as the notional amount, interest rate and payment dates in the interest rate swap match those of the hedged cash flows. The fair value of the interest rate swap as of   September 30, 2016   was approximately   $(0.6) million   and is reported in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. There were   no   interest rate derivatives outstanding as of December 31, 2015.  

8. INCOME TAXES 
  ESH REIT has elected to be taxed and expects to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code. A REIT is a legal entity that holds real estate assets and is generally not subject to federal and state income taxes. In order to maintain qualification as a REIT, ESH REIT is required to distribute at least   90%   of its taxable income, excluding net capital gain, to its shareholders each year. In addition, ESH REIT must meet a number of complex organizational and operational requirements. If ESH REIT were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it would be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) and generally would be precluded from qualifying as a REIT for the subsequent four taxable years following the year during which it lost its REIT qualification. Even in qualifying as a REIT, ESH REIT may be subject to state and local taxes in certain jurisdictions, and is subject to federal income and excise taxes on undistributed income. 
  ESH REIT intends to distribute its taxable income to the extent necessary to optimize its tax efficiency including, but not limited to, maintaining its REIT status, while retaining sufficient capital for its ongoing needs. Accordingly, ESH REIT expects to distribute approximately   100%   of its taxable income for the foreseeable future.  As of December 31, 2015, the expectation was to distribute approximately   95%   of ESH REIT s taxable income. As a result of this change, during the three months ended March 31, 2016, ESH REIT recognized a benefit of approximately   $(2.3) million   with respect to the reversal of net deferred tax liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2015, which represented the previously estimated   5%   of taxable income to be retained by ESH REIT. 
  In January 2016, ESH REIT paid a special distribution of approximately   $86.5 million  . Approximately   $77.4 million   of the special distribution was deductible in 2015; the remaining approximately   $9.1 million   is deductible in 2016. The special distribution is subject to current taxation to ESH REIT as a distribution in 2016 at the time of payment. 
  In 2015, ESH REIT distributed approximately   95%   of its taxable income and utilized its federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately   $18.6 million  . As a result, in 2015, ESH REIT incurred minimal current federal income tax in the form of alternative minimum tax.  
  ESH REIT recorded a provision for state and foreign income taxes of approximately   $0.7 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , an effective rate of approximately   2.8%  , as compared with a provision of approximately   $0.4 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , an effective rate of approximately   0.9%  . ESH REIT recorded a benefit for state and foreign income taxes of approximately   $(3.1) million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , an effective rate of approximately   (18.5)%  , as compared with a provision of approximately   $0.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an effective rate of approximately   0.8%  . ESH REIT s effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate of   35%   primarily due to ESH REIT s status as a REIT under the provisions of the Code. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , ESH REIT recognized a discrete provision to return adjustment of approximately   $0.5 million  . During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , in addition to an approximate   $(0.8) million   provision to return adjustment, ESH REIT also recognized the approximate   $(2.3) million   benefit discussed above. 
  ESH REIT s income tax returns for the years 2013 to present are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities.

  Legal Contingencies   ESH REIT is not a party to any litigation or claims, other than routine matters arising in the ordinary course of business that are incidental to the operation of the business of ESH REIT. ESH REIT believes that the results of all claims and litigation, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on its business or unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

11. EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION 
  The Corporation and ESH REIT each maintain a long-term incentive plan ( LTIP ), as amended and restated in 2015, approved by their shareholders. Under the LTIPs, the Corporation and ESH REIT may issue to eligible employees or directors restricted stock awards ("RSAs"), restricted stock units ("RSUs") or other equity-based awards, in respect of Paired Shares, with service, performance or market vesting conditions. The aggregate number of Paired Shares that may be the subject of awards under the LTIPs shall not exceed   8,000,000  , of which no more than   4,000,000   may be granted as incentive stock options. Each of the Corporation s and ESH REIT s LTIP has a share reserve of an equivalent number of shares of Corporation common stock and ESH REIT Class B common stock. As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   4,052,000   Paired Shares were available for future issuance under the LTIPs. 
  Equity-based compensation expense is recognized by amortizing the grant-date fair value of the equity-based awards, less estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of each award. The fair value of equity-based awards is based on the closing price of a Paired Share on the date of grant. A portion of the grant-date fair value of all equity-based awards is allocated to a share of Corporation common stock and a portion is allocated to a share of ESH REIT Class B common stock. Expense related to the portion of the grant-date fair value with respect to a share of Corporation common stock is recorded as a payable due to the Corporation. Expense related to the portion of the grant-date fair value with respect to a share of Class B common stock of ESH REIT is recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital.

During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , ESH REIT incurred approximately   $0.6 million   and   $1.5 million  , respectively, of equity-based compensation expense (which included approximately   $0.5 million   and   $1.4 million   paid to the Corporation). During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , ESH REIT incurred approximately   $0.3 million   and   $1.0 million  , respectively, of equity-based compensation expense (which included approximately   $0.2 million   and   $0.6 million   paid to the Corporation). Equity-based compensation expense is included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was approximately   $0.3 million   of unrecognized compensation expense related to outstanding equity-based awards, which is expected to be recognized subsequent to   September 30, 2016   over a weighted-average period of approximately   2.9   years. Total unrecognized compensation expense will be adjusted for actual forfeitures. 
    
  ESH REIT will have to pay more or less for a share of the Corporation common stock than it would have otherwise paid at the time of grant as the result of regular market changes in the value of a Paired Share between the time of grant and the time of settlement. An increase in the value allocated to a share of Corporation common stock due to market changes in the value of a Paired Share between the time of grant and the time of settlement is recorded as a distribution to the Corporation. A decrease in the value allocated to a share of Corporation common stock due to market changes in the value of a Paired Share between the time of grant and the time of settlement is recorded as additional paid in capital from the Corporation. 
    
  The Corporation accounts for awards issued under its LTIP in a manner similar to that of ESH REIT. As such, for all LTIP awards granted by the Corporation, ESH REIT will receive compensation for the fair value of the Class B shares on the date of settlement of such Class B shares by ESH REIT. As of   September 30, 2016  , ESH REIT is expected to issue, and be compensated in cash for, approximately   1,918,000   shares of Class B common stock of ESH REIT in future periods for RSUs issued by the Corporation, assuming performance-based awards vest at less than   100%   of their target level and no additional forfeitures. 
  RSA/RSU activity during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , was as follows: 

12. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
  On October 4, 2016, certain selling stockholders (the "Selling Stockholders") sold     13.0 million     Paired Shares as part of a secondary offering.     The Selling Shareholders consisted solely of entities affiliated with the Sponsors and did not include officers or directors of the Corporation or ESH REIT. ESH REIT did not sell Class B common shares in the secondary offering and did not receive proceeds from the secondary offering. ESH REIT did, however, incur professional fees in connection with the secondary offering.

The share repurchase was funded from cash on hand. After completion of these transactions, the Sponsors owned approximately   57.0%   of the ESH REIT Class B common shares. 
  On   October 6, 2016  , ESH REIT executed a purchase and sale agreement to divest   one   property for approximately   $44.8 million  . A subsidiary of the Corporation expects to lease back the property at nominal rent. This transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions.

Overview 
  We are the largest integrated owner/operator of company-branded hotels in North America. Our business operates in the extended stay lodging industry, and as of   September 30, 2016  , we owned and operated 629 hotel properties comprising approximately 69,400 rooms located in 44 states across the United States and in Canada. We own and operate the substantial majority of our hotels under our core brand, Extended Stay America, which serves the mid-price extended stay segment, and accounts for approximately 45% of the segment by number of rooms in the United States. In addition, we own and operate three Extended Stay Canada hotels.  
  Our extended stay hotels are designed to provide an affordable and attractive alternative to traditional lodging or apartment accommodations and are targeted toward self-sufficient, value-conscious guests. Our hotels feature fully-furnished rooms with in-room kitchens, complimentary grab-and-go breakfast, free WiFi, flat screen TVs and on-site guest laundry. Our guests include business travelers, leisure travelers, professionals on temporary work or training assignments, persons relocating, temporarily displaced or purchasing a home and anyone else in need of temporary housing. Our guests generally rent accommodations on a weekly or longer term basis. For the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  , approximately 34.9%, 22.9% and 42.2% of our total revenues were derived from guests with stays from 1-6 nights, from 7-29 nights and 30 or more nights, respectively. 
  In December 2015, we sold a portfolio of 53 hotel properties, 47 of which operated under our former Crossland Economy Studios brand and six of which operated under our Extended Stay America brand, and certain intellectual property of Crossland Economy Studios (the "Portfolio Sale"). We no longer own, operate or manage these hotel properties, nor do we own intellectual property related to Crossland Economy Studios. See Note 4 to each of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Extended Stay America, Inc. and ESH Hospitality, Inc., both of which are included in Item 1 in this combined quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

Understanding Our Results of Operations The Company 
  Revenues and Expenses.   The Company s revenues are derived from hotel ownership and operations. Hotel operating expenses account for the largest portion of the Company s operating expenses and reflect ongoing expenses associated with the ownership and operation of our hotels.  
  The following table presents the components of the Company s revenues as a percentage of our total revenues for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 
                   
    Percentage of 
  2016 Year to 
  Date 
  Revenues 
              Room revenues  . Room revenues are driven primarily by ADR and occupancy. Pricing policy and customer mix are significant drivers of ADR. Due to our relatively high occupancy levels, our primary focus is on increasing RevPAR by increasing ADR. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we experienced RevPAR growth of approximately     7.5%   compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. On a Comparable Hotel basis, we experienced RevPAR growth of approximately 3.9%, mainly     due to a shift in our customer mix to a greater number of high yield, shorter-stay business and leisure guests, the collective impact of our hotel renovation program and a focus on service excellence. 
    98.5% 
              Other hotel revenues  . Other hotel revenues include ancillary revenues such as laundry revenues, vending commissions, additional housekeeping fees and pet charges. Occupancy and customer mix, as well as the number and percentage of guests that have longer-term stays, are the key drivers of other hotel revenues.

  Operating 
  Expenses 
              Hotel operating expenses  . Hotel operating expenses have both fixed and variable components. Operating expenses that are relatively fixed include personnel expense, real estate tax expense and property insurance premium expense. Occupancy is a key driver of expenses that have a high degree of variability such as housekeeping services and amenity costs. Other variable expenses include marketing costs, reservation costs, property insurance claims expense and repairs and maintenance expense. We experienced a decrease in hotel operating expenses of approximately $6.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. On a Comparable Hotel basis, we experienced an increase in hotel operating expenses of approximately $24.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, mainly due to increases in personnel expense, reservation costs, loss on disposal of assets, real estate tax expense and credit card fees, partially offset by decreases in utilities expense and amenity costs. 
    64.9% 
              General and administrative expenses  . General and administrative expenses include expenses associated with corporate overhead. These costs consist primarily of compensation expense of our corporate staff, which includes equity-based compensation, and professional fees, including audit, tax, legal and consulting fees. 
    10.7% 
              Depreciation and amortization  . Depreciation and amortization is a non-cash charge that relates primarily to the acquisition and related usage of hotels and other property and equipment, including capital expenditures incurred with respect to our hotel renovations. 
    24.0% 
             Impairment of long-lived assets.   Impairment of long-lived assets is a non-cash charge recognized when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an individual asset, or group of assets, may not be recoverable.

Results of Operations 
  Results of Operations discusses each of the Company s and ESH REIT s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, each of which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those relating to property and equipment, goodwill, revenue recognition, income taxes, equity-based compensation and investments. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. 
  Results of Operations The Company 
  Comparison of Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015    
  As of   September 30, 2015  , we owned and operated 682 hotels consisting of 76,000 rooms. On December 8, 2015, we completed the Portfolio Sale. Therefore, as of   September 30, 2016  , we owned and operated 629 hotels consisting of approximately 69,400 rooms.

     Room revenues  . Room revenues decreased by approximately $6.4 million, or 1.8%, to approximately $349.1 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to approximately $355.4 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , due to the Portfolio Sale.  On a Comparable Hotel basis, room revenues increased by approximately $12.6 million, or 3.8%, primarily due to a 2.4% increase in ADR as well as a 100 bps increase in occupancy, resulting in a 3.7% increase in RevPAR, primarily a result of a shift in our customer mix to a greater number of high yield, shorter-stay business and leisure guests, the collective impact of our hotel renovation program and a focus on service excellence. 
  Other hotel revenues  . Other hotel revenues increased by approximately $0.4 million, or 7.4%, to approximately $5.4 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to approximately $5.1 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . On a Comparable Hotel basis, other hotel revenues increased by approximately $0.7 million, or 15.5%, to approximately $5.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately $4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
  Hotel operating expenses.   Hotel operating expenses decreased by approximately $9.2 million, or 5.8%, to approximately $149.9 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to approximately $159.0 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , due to the Portfolio Sale. On a Comparable Hotel basis, hotel operating expenses increased by approximately $1.7 million, or 1.2%, partly due to an increase in personnel expense of approximately $2.0 million and reservation costs of approximately $1.4 million, which related to an increase in commissionable bookings through online travel agents. This increase was also driven by an increase in loss on disposal of assets of approximately $1.0 million as a result of our hotel renovation program, real estate tax expense of approximately $0.9 million and property insurance claims expense of approximately $0.6 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases in repairs and maintenance expense of approximately $1.8 million, amenity costs of approximately $1.3 million and marketing costs of approximately $1.2 million. 
  General and administrative expenses  . General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $0.2 million, or 1.0%, to approximately $24.6 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to approximately $24.4 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was driven by an increase in overhead personnel expense of approximately $0.7 million as well as legal and other professional fees of approximately $0.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in travel expenses of approximately $0.5 million.

Depreciation and amortization.   Depreciation and amortization increased by approximately $3.7 million, or 7.1%, to approximately $56.0 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to approximately $52.3 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , which was primarily due to an increase in investment in hotel assets as a result of our hotel renovation program, partially offset by the Portfolio Sale. 
  Impairment of long-lived assets.   Asset impairments are recorded as required based on an evaluation of property and equipment and intangible assets for impairment.  During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized impairment charges of approximately $2.8 million and $9.0 million, respectively. 
  Other non-operating (income) expense.   During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized a non-cash foreign currency transaction gain of approximately $0.3 million, related to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar at one of our Canadian currency-based entities which had U.S. dollar denominated debt. During the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recognized a non-cash foreign currency transaction loss of approximately $1.1 million, related to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar. 
  Interest expense, net.   Excluding debt extinguishment costs of approximately $14.1 million incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2016 related to the full repayment of the balance of approximately $1,497.6 million outstanding on ESH REIT s $2.52 billion mortgage loan entered into in November 2012 (the "2012 Mortgage Loan"), consisting of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs of approximately $12.8 million and other costs of approximately $1.3 million, net interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased approximately $0.5 million, or 1.4%, to approximately $34.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately $35.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The Company s weighted average interest rate increased to approximately 4.6% as of September 30, 2016 compared to approximately 4.4% as of September 30, 2015. However, the Company s total debt outstanding decreased to approximately $2.6 billion, net of unamortized deferred financing costs and debt discount, as of September 30, 2016, compared to approximately $2.8 billion, net of unamortized deferred financing costs and debt discount, as of September 30, 2015.  
  Income tax expense.   Our effective income tax rate decreased by approximately 5.0 percentage points to approximately 21.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately 26.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The Company s effective tax rate is lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% due to ESH REIT s status as a REIT under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). The decrease in our effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is due to the recognition of a discrete provision to return income tax benefit of approximately $(2.0) million upon the filing of an income tax return.  In addition, we recognized an income tax benefit of approximately $(0.8) million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 related to the reversal of a deferred tax liability associated with the Company's anticipated receipt of future ESH REIT nontaxable distributions. ESH REIT intends to distribute its taxable income to the extent necessary to optimize its tax efficiency including, but not limited to, maintaining its REIT status, while retaining sufficient capital for its ongoing needs. Accordingly, ESH REIT expects to distribute approximately 100% of its taxable income for the foreseeable future. ESH REIT will incur federal and state income tax at statutory rates on its taxable income not distributed.

     Room revenues  . Room revenues decreased by approximately $14.1 million, or 1.4%, to approximately $960.0 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to approximately $974.1 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , due to the Portfolio Sale.  On a Comparable Hotel basis, room revenues increased by approximately $39.7 million, or 4.3%, primarily due to a 4.0% increase in ADR partially offset by a 10 bps decrease in occupancy, mainly driven by an increase in the number of room nights displaced from renovation, resulting in a 3.9% increase in RevPAR, primarily a result of a shift in our customer mix to a greater number of high yield, shorter-stay business and leisure guests, the collective impact of our hotel renovation program and a focus on service excellence. 
  Other hotel revenues  . Other hotel revenues increased by approximately $0.5 million, or 3.7%, to approximately $14.8 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to approximately $14.3 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . On a Comparable Hotel basis, other hotel revenues increased by approximately $1.5 million, or 11.4%, to approximately $14.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately $13.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
  Hotel operating expenses.   Hotel operating expenses decreased by approximately $6.0 million, or 1.3%, to approximately $444.5 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to approximately $450.5 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , due to the Portfolio Sale. On a Comparable Hotel basis, hotel operating expenses increased by approximately $24.7 million, or 5.9%, partly due to an increase in personnel expense of approximately $12.3 million and reservation costs of approximately $7.0 million, which related to an increase in commissionable bookings through online travel agents. This increase was also driven by an increase in loss on disposal of assets of approximately $4.2 million as a result of our hotel renovation program, real estate tax expense of approximately $3.1 million, partially due to the receipt of a $2.1 million refund in the prior year as a result of the appeal of real estate taxes in certain jurisdictions, and credit card fees of approximately $2.5 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases in utilities expense of approximately $1.9 million as well as amenity costs of approximately $1.1 million. 
  General and administrative expenses  . General and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $0.3 million, or 0.5%, to approximately $73.6 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to approximately $73.9 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  ,   mainly driven by a decrease in legal and other professional fees of approximately $2.1 million. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of approximately $1.5 million in expenses related

     Table of Contents  

to future growth initiatives as well as overhead personnel expense of approximately $1.4 million, including equity-based compensation expense for awards granted to employees during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
  Depreciation and amortization.   Depreciation and amortization increased by approximately $12.3 million, or 8.1%, to approximately $164.3 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to approximately $152.0 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , which was primarily due to an increase in investment in hotel assets as a result of our hotel renovation program, partially offset by the Portfolio Sale. 
    
  Impairment of long-lived assets.   Asset impairments are recorded as required based on an evaluation of property and equipment and intangible assets for impairment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized impairment charges of approximately $2.8 million and $9.0 million, respectively. 
  Other non-operating (income) expense.   During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized a non-cash foreign currency transaction gain of approximately $1.1 million, related to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar at one of our Canadian currency-based entities which had U.S. dollar denominated debt. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recognized a non-cash foreign currency transaction loss of approximately $2.0 million, related to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar. 
  Interest expense, net.   Excluding debt extinguishment costs of approximately $26.2 million incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 related to the full repayment of the 2012 Mortgage Loan and ESH REIT's former term loan facility, which consisted of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and debt discount of approximately $21.2 million and prepayment penalties and other costs of approximately $5.0 million, and excluding debt extinguishment costs of approximately $2.3 million incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 related to the partial repayment of the 2012 Mortgage Loan, which consisted of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs of approximately $1.7 million and other costs of approximately $0.6 million, net interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $5.6 million, or 5.6%, to approximately $105.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately $99.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to an increase in the Company s weighted-average interest rate. The Company s weighted average interest rate increased to approximately 4.6% as of September 30, 2016 compared to approximately 4.4% as of September 30, 2015. However, the Company s total debt outstanding decreased to approximately $2.6 billion, net of unamortized deferred financing costs and debt discount, as of September 30, 2016, compared to approximately $2.8 billion, net of unamortized deferred financing costs and debt discount, as of September 30, 2015. 
  Income tax expense.   Our effective income tax rate decreased by approximately 7.8 percentage points to approximately 16.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately 24.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company s effective tax rate is lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% due to ESH REIT s status as a REIT under the provisions of the Code. The decrease in our effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is due to the recognition of an income tax benefit of approximately $(1.8) million with respect to the reversal of net deferred tax liabilities reported as of December 31, 2015, which represented the previously estimated 5% of taxable income to be retained by ESH REIT. In addition, we recognized an income tax benefit of approximately $(8.5) million related to the reversal of a deferred tax liability associated with the Company s anticipated receipt of future ESH REIT nontaxable distributions. Further, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized a discrete provision to return adjustment of approximately $(2.0) million upon the filing of an income tax return. ESH REIT intends to distribute its taxable income to the extent necessary to optimize its tax efficiency including, but not limited to, maintaining its REIT status, while retaining sufficient capital for its ongoing needs.  Accordingly, ESH REIT expects to distribute approximately 100% of its taxable income for the foreseeable future. ESH REIT will incur federal and state income tax at statutory rates on its taxable income not distributed.

Results of Operations ESH REIT 
  ESH REIT s sole source of revenues is lease rental revenues and its hotel operating expenses reflect only those hotel operating expenses that are incurred directly related to its ownership of the hotels. Administrative costs reimbursed to ESA Management are reflected as a component of general and administrative expenses.  
  Comparison of Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015 
  As of   September 30, 2015  , ESH REIT owned 682 hotels consisting of 76,000 rooms. On December 8, 2015, ESH REIT sold a portfolio of 53 hotels, 47 of which operated under the Crossland Economy Studios brand and six of which operated under the Extended Stay America brand. Therefore, as of   September 30, 2016  , ESH REIT owned 629 hotels consisting of approximately 69,400 rooms. See Note 4 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of ESH Hospitality, Inc., which are included in Item 1 in this combined quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 
  The following table presents ESH REIT s consolidated results of operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , including the amount and percentage change in these results between the periods (in thousands):  

Rental revenues from Extended Stay America, Inc.   Rental revenues decreased by approximately $3.7 million, or 2.4%, to approximately $153.1 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to approximately $156.8 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Rental revenues consist of fixed minimum rental payments recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the lease plus specified percentages of total hotel revenues over designated thresholds. Percentage rental revenues of approximately $36.8 million and $33.7 million were recognized during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The decrease in rental revenues was mainly due to the sale of the portfolio of 53 hotels in December 2015, offset by the improved performance of the leased hotels and the depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar. 
  Hotel operating expenses  . Hotel operating expenses increased by approximately $2.0 million, or 10.2%, to approximately $22.2 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to approximately $20.1 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . This increase was due to an increase in property related costs that were obligations of ESH REIT due to its ownership of the hotels, including property insurance claims and other related expenses of approximately $1.2 million, as well as loss on disposal of assets of approximately $1.1 million as a result of ESH REIT s hotel renovation program.   
  General and administrative expenses.   General and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $0.4 million, or 10.7%, to approximately $3.5 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to approximately $3.9 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in equity-based compensation expense of approximately $0.3 million as well as a decrease in legal and other professional fees of approximately $0.2 million. These decreases were offset by an increase in costs incurred related to the October 2016 secondary offering and the June 2015 registration statement of approximately $0.2 million.

  Other non-operating (income) expense.   During the three months ended September 30, 2016, ESH REIT recognized a non-cash foreign currency transaction gain of approximately $0.1 million, related to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar at one of its Canadian currency-based entities which had U.S. dollar denominated debt. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, ESH REIT recognized a non-cash foreign currency transaction loss of approximately $1.2 million related to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar. 
  Interest expense, net.   Excluding debt extinguishment costs of approximately $14.1 million incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2016 related to the full repayment of the balance of approximately $1,497.6 million outstanding on the 2012 Mortgage Loan, consisting of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs of approximately $12.8 million and other costs of approximately $1.3 million, net interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased approximately $0.1 million, or 0.2%, to approximately $34.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately $34.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. ESH REIT s weighted average interest rate increased to approximately 4.6% as of September 30, 2016 compared to approximately 4.3% as of September 30, 2015. However, ESH REIT s total debt outstanding decreased to approximately $2.6 billion, net of unamortized deferred financing costs and debt discount, as of September 30, 2016, compared to approximately $2.8 billion, net of unamortized deferred financing costs and debt discount, as of September 30, 2015. 
  Income tax expense.   ESH REIT s effective income tax rate increased by approximately 1.9 percentage points to approximately 2.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately 0.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. ESH REIT s effective tax rate is lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% due to its status as a REIT under the provisions of the Code. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, ESH REIT recognized a discrete provision to return adjustment of approximately $0.5 million upon the filing of an income tax return. 
  Comparison of   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015 
  As of   September 30, 2015  , ESH REIT owned 682 hotels consisting of 76,000 rooms.

The following table presents ESH REIT s consolidated results of operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , including the amount and percentage change in these results between the periods (in thousands):   

  Rental revenues from Extended Stay America, Inc.   Rental revenues decreased by approximately $17.8 million, or 4.4%, to approximately $385.9 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to approximately $403.6 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Rental revenues consist of fixed minimum rental payments recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the lease plus specified percentages of total hotel revenues over designated thresholds. Percentage rental revenues of approximately $37.0 million and $34.1 million were recognized during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The decrease in rental revenues was mainly due to the sale of the portfolio of 53 hotels in December 2015, offset by the improved performance of the leased hotels and the depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar. 
  Hotel operating expenses  . Hotel operating expenses increased by approximately $3.3 million, or 5.0%, to approximately $68.8 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to approximately $65.5 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was due to an increase in loss on disposal of assets of approximately $4.0 million as a result of ESH REIT s hotel renovation program as well as an increase in real estate tax expense of approximately $0.5 million, partially due to the receipt of a $2.1 million refund in the prior year as a result of the appeal of real estate taxes in certain jurisdictions. These increases were offset by decreases in property-related costs that were obligations of ESH REIT due to the sale of the 53 hotels in December 2015, including property insurance claims and other related expenses of approximately $1.2 million. 
  General and administrative expenses.   General and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $1.6 million, or 12.8%, to approximately $10.7 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to approximately $12.3 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in equity-based compensation expense of approximately $0.9 million as well as a decrease in reimbursable costs of approximately $0.5 million to ESA Management for administrative services performed on ESH REIT s behalf (including executive management, accounting, financial analysis, training and technology). These decreases were offset by an increase in legal and other professional fees of approximately $0.4 million  .  
   Depreciation.   Depreciation increased by approximately $12.2 million, or 8.2%, to approximately $160.5 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to approximately $148.4 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , which was primarily due to an increase in investment in hotel assets as a result of ESH REIT's hotel renovation program, partially offset by the sale of the portfolio of 53 hotels in December 2015. 
  Other non-operating (income) expense.   During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , ESH REIT recognized a non-cash foreign currency transaction gain of approximately $0.9 million, related to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar at one of its Canadian currency-based entities which had U.S. dollar denominated debt.

ended   September 30, 2015  , ESH REIT recognized a non-cash foreign currency transaction loss of approximately $2.3 million, related to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar at one of its Canadian currency-based entities which had U.S. dollar denominated debt.  
  Interest expense  , net. Excluding debt extinguishment costs of approximately $26.2 million incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 related to the full repayment of the 2012 Mortgage Loan and ESH REIT's former term loan facility, which consisted of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and debt discount of approximately $21.2 million and prepayment penalties and other costs of approximately $5.0 million, and excluding debt extinguishment costs of approximately $2.3 million incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 related to the partial repayment of the 2012 Mortgage Loan, which consisted of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs of approximately $1.7 million and other costs of approximately $0.6 million, net interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $6.3 million, or 6.5%, to approximately $103.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately $97.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to an increase in ESH REIT s weighted-average interest rate. ESH REIT s weighted-average interest rate increased to approximately 4.6% as of September 30, 2016 compared to approximately 4.3% as of September 30, 2015. However, ESH REIT s total debt outstanding decreased to approximately $2.6 billion, net of unamortized deferred financing costs and debt discount, as of September 30, 2016, compared to approximately $2.8 billion, net of unamortized deferred financing costs and debt discount, as of September 30, 2015. 
  Income tax (benefit) expense.   ESH REIT s effective income tax rate decreased by approximately 19.3 percentage points to a benefit of approximately 18.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a provision of approximately 0.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. ESH REIT s effective tax rate is lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% due to its status as a REIT under the provisions of the Code. The decrease in ESH REIT's effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is due to the recognition of an income tax benefit of approximately $(2.3) million with respect to the reversal of net deferred tax liabilities for ESH REIT, which related to the previously estimated 5% of taxable income expected to be retained by ESH REIT. In addition, ESH REIT recognized a discrete provision to return adjustment of approximately $(0.8) million. ESH REIT intends to distribute its taxable income to the extent necessary to optimize its tax efficiency including, but not limited to, maintaining its REIT status, while retaining sufficient capital for its ongoing needs. Accordingly, ESH REIT expects to distribute approximately 100% of its taxable income for the foreseeable future. ESH REIT will incur federal and state income tax at statutory rates on its taxable income not distributed. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
  EBITDA is defined as net income excluding: (1) net interest expense; (2) income tax expense; and (3) depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. The Company believes that EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance as it helps us and investors evaluate the ongoing performance of our hotels after removing the impact of our capital structure, primarily net interest expense, our corporate structure, primarily income tax expense, and our asset base, primarily depreciation and amortization. We believe that the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging companies, hotel owners and capital-intensive companies. Additionally, EBITDA is a measure that is widely used by management in our annual budgeting and compensation planning processes. 
  The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA when evaluating our performance because we believe the adjustment for certain additional items, described below, provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance and that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with the U.S. GAAP presentation of net income, net income per common share and cash flow provided by operating activities, is beneficial to the overall understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We adjust EBITDA for the following items and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDA: 

Non-cash equity-based compensation   We exclude non-cash charges related to the amortization of equity-based compensation awards to employees and directors. 
                
    Other non-operating (income) expense    We exclude the effect of other non-operating income or expense, as we believe non-cash foreign currency transaction gain or loss is not reflective of ongoing or future operating performance. 
                
    Impairment of long-lived assets    We exclude the effect of impairment losses recorded on property and equipment and intangible assets, as we believe they are not reflective of ongoing or future operating performance. 
     
   64 

     Table of Contents  

Other expenses   We exclude the effect of other expenses that we do not consider reflective of ongoing or future operating performance including the following: loss on disposal of assets, costs incurred in connection with secondary offerings and the preparation of registration statements and transaction costs associated with the sale of hotel properties. 
     EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to similar measures calculated by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income, net income per common share, cash flow from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Cash expenditures for real estate or hotel assets such as capital expenditures, interest expense and other items have been and will continue to be incurred and are not reflected in EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions and assessments of operating performance. The Company s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and cash flows include capital expenditures, net interest expense and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, in addition to our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not solely be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including unit growth or our ability to pay distributions. 
  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not meaningful or useful measures for ESH REIT on a stand-alone basis due to the fact that a Paired Share represents an investment in the Company, as a single, consolidated enterprise, which is reflected in the consolidated Company results of operations; therefore, we believe these performance measures are meaningful for the Company only.  
  The following table provides a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the Company for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands):

    Includes loss of disposal of assets of approximately $3.3 million, $0.2 million of which relates to hotels not owned for the entirety of periods presented, and costs incurred in connection with the preparation of the registration statement filed in June 2015 of approximately $0.7 million. 
     Hotel Operating Profit and Hotel Operating Margin 
  Hotel Operating Profit and Hotel Operating Margin measure hotel-level operating results prior to debt service, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and general and administrative expenses. The Company believes that Hotel Operating Profit and Hotel Operating Margin are useful measures to investors regarding our operating performance as they help us and investors evaluate aggregate hotel-level profitability, specifically hotel operating efficiency and effectiveness. Further, these measures allow us and our investors to analyze period over period operating margin flow-through (the change in Hotel Operating Profit divided by the change in total hotel revenues). 
  We define Hotel Operating Profit as the sum of room and other hotel revenues less hotel operating expenses (excluding loss on disposal of assets) and Hotel Operating Margin as the ratio of Hotel Operating Profit divided by total hotel revenues. Hotel Operating Profit and Hotel Operating Margin are not meaningful or useful measures for ESH REIT on a stand-alone basis due to the fact that a Paired Share represents an investment in the Company, as a single, consolidated enterprise, which is reflected in the consolidated Company results of operations; therefore, we believe these performance measures are meaningful for the Company only.

     Paired Share Income, Adjusted Paired Share Income and Adjusted Paired Share Income per Paired Share 
  We present Paired Share Income, Adjusted Paired Share Income and Adjusted Paired Share Income per Paired Share as supplemental measures of the Company s operating performance. We believe that these are useful measures for investors since our Paired Shares, directly through the common stock of the Corporation and Class B common stock of ESH REIT, and indirectly through the Corporation s ownership of the Class A common stock of ESH REIT, entitle holders of our Paired Shares to participate in 100% of the common equity and earnings of both the Corporation and ESH REIT. As required by U.S. GAAP, net income attributable to common shareholders excludes earnings attributable to ESH REIT s Class B common shares, a noncontrolling interest. Based on the limitation on transfer provided for in each of the Corporation s and ESH REIT s charters, shares of common stock of the Corporation and shares of Class B common stock of ESH REIT are transferrable and tradable only in combination as units, each unit consisting of one share of the Corporation s common stock and one share of ESH REIT Class B common stock. As a result, we believe that Paired Share Income, Adjusted Paired Share Income and Adjusted Paired Share Income per Paired Share represent useful measures to holders of our Paired Shares. 
  
   67 

     Table of Contents  

Paired Share Income is defined as the sum of net income attributable to common shareholders and noncontrolling interests attributable to Class B common shares of ESH REIT. Adjusted Paired Share Income is defined as Paired Share Income adjusted for items that, net of income taxes, we believe are not reflective of our ongoing or future operating performance. We adjust Paired Share Income for the following items, net of income taxes, and refer to this measure as Adjusted Paired Share Income: debt extinguishment costs, other non-operating (income) expense (including foreign currency transaction gain or loss), impairment of long-lived assets and other expenses, such as loss on disposal of assets, costs incurred in connection with secondary offerings and the preparation of registration statements and transaction costs associated with the sale of hotel properties. With the exception of equity-based compensation, an ongoing charge, and debt extinguishment costs, these adjustments (other than the effect of income taxes) are the same as those used in the reconciliation of EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA. 
  Adjusted Paired Share Income per Paired Share is defined as Adjusted Paired Share Income divided by the number of Paired Shares outstanding on a diluted basis. Until such time as the number of outstanding common shares of the Corporation and Class B common shares of ESH REIT differ, we believe Adjusted Paired Share Income per Paired Share is useful to investors, as it represents the economic risks and rewards related to an investment in our Paired Shares. We believe that Paired Share Income, Adjusted Paired Share Income and Adjusted Paired Share Income per Paired Share provide meaningful indicators of the Company s operating performance in addition to separate and/or individual analyses of net income attributable to common shareholders of the Corporation and net income attributable to Class B common shareholders of ESH REIT, each of which is impacted by specific U.S. GAAP requirements, including the recognition of contingent lease rental revenues and the recognition of lease rental revenues on a straight-line basis, and may not necessarily reflect how cash flows are generated on an individual entity or total enterprise basis. Paired Share Income, Adjusted Paired Share Income and Adjusted Paired Share Income per Paired Share should not be considered as an alternative to net income of the Company, net income of the Corporation, net income of ESH REIT, net income per share of common stock of the Corporation, net income per share of Class A or Class B common stock of ESH REIT or any other operating measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
  Paired Share Income, Adjusted Paired Share Income and Adjusted Paired Share Income per Paired Share are not meaningful or useful measures for ESH REIT on a stand-alone basis due to the fact that a Paired Share represents an investment in the Company, as a single, consolidated enterprise, which is reflected in the consolidated Company results of operations; therefore, we believe these performance measures are meaningful for the Company only.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Company Overview 
  On a consolidated basis, we have historically generated significant cash flow from operations and have financed our ongoing business primarily with existing cash and cash flow generated from operations. We generated cash flow from operations of approximately $335.0 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Our current liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for operating expenses associated with our hotels, recurring maintenance and capital expenditures necessary to maintain our hotels, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, income taxes, Paired Share repurchases, Corporation distributions, required ESH REIT distributions, growth initiatives, and the repayment of outstanding amounts under our revolving credit facilities. In addition to recurring maintenance and capital expenditures necessary to maintain our hotels, we are also performing, and expect to continue to perform, renovations to our hotels. See       Capital Expenditures     Hotel Renovation Program.  We expect to fund our hotel renovation program from a combination of cash on hand, cash flow generated from operations and/or borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, as needed.  
  Long-term liquidity requirements are expected to include the need to (i) obtain funds to acquire, develop or construct additional hotels, and (ii) refinance (including prior to or in connection with debt maturity payments) ESH REIT s 2016 Term Facility (as defined below) and 5.25% senior notes due 2025 (the "2025 Notes") maturing in August 2023 and May 2025, respectively. See Note 7 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Extended Stay America, Inc. and Note 6 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of ESH Hospitality, Inc., both of which are included in Item 1 in this combined quarterly report on Form 10-Q. We cannot assure you that the Corporation and/or ESH REIT will be able to refinance any of its debt on attractive terms at or before maturity, or on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or the timing of any such refinancing. 
  We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, including future debt financings or equity issuances by the Corporation and/or ESH REIT, existing working capital and cash flow generated from operations. However, there are a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to access these capital sources, including the current and future state of overall capital and credit markets, our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions imposed by existing or prospective lenders, general market conditions for the lodging industry, our operating performance and liquidity and market perceptions about us. The success of our business strategies will depend, in part, on our ability to access these various capital sources. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. 
  The Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $149.8 million at   September 30, 2016  . Based upon the current level of operations, management believes that cash flow from operations, together with our cash balances and available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, will be adequate to meet our anticipated funding requirements and business objectives for the foreseeable future. We regularly review our capital structure and at any time may refinance or repay existing indebtedness, incur new indebtedness or issue debt or equity securities.  
  In August 2016, ESH REIT entered into a new credit agreement providing for senior secured credit facilities (collectively, the "2016 ESH REIT Credit Facilities, ) consisting of a $1,300.0 million senior secured term loan facility (the  2016 Term Facility ) and a $350 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the  2016 ESH REIT Revolving Credit Facility ). ESH REIT borrowed $1,300.0 million at 99.5% of par value under the 2016 Term Facility and $50.0 million under the 2016 ESH REIT Revolving Credit Facility. Also in August 2016, the Corporation and ESH REIT entered into an agreement providing for an unsecured intercompany credit facility (the "Unsecured Intercompany Facility"), under which ESH REIT borrowed $75.0 million from the Corporation upon closing of the facility. ESH REIT used the proceeds from the 2016 Term Facility, the 2016 ESH REIT Revolving Credit Facility and the Unsecured Intercompany Facility, together with cash on hand, to fully repay the outstanding balance of approximately $1,497.6 million under its 2012 Mortgage Loan. For a description of the 2016 ESH REIT Credit Facilities, Unsecured Intercompany Facility and new Corporation revolving credit facility see Note 7 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Extended Stay America, Inc. and Note 6 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of ESH Hospitality, Inc., both of which are included in Item 1 in this combined quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

In March 2016, ESH REIT issued $800.0 million of additional 2025 Notes at 98.5% of par value. ESH REIT received net proceeds of approximately $772.8 million, which, together with cash on hand, were used to fully repay the balance of approximately $366.5 million outstanding under its former term loan facility and repay approximately $433.5 million of the outstanding balance under its 2012 Mortgage Loan. 
  In December 2015, the Boards of Directors of the Corporation and ESH REIT authorized a combined Paired Share repurchase program for up to $100 million of Paired Shares. In February 2016, the Boards of Directors of the Corporation and ESH REIT authorized an increase of the combined Paired Share repurchase program from $100 million to up to $200 million of Paired Shares. The program expires on December 31, 2016. Repurchases may be made at management s discretion from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means (including Rule 10b5-1 trading plans). Depending on market conditions and other factors, these repurchases may be commenced or suspended without prior notice. As of September 30, 2016, the Corporation and ESH REIT repurchased and retired their respective portion of approximately 4.6 million Paired Shares for approximately $69.6 million. Subsequent to September 30, 2016, the Corporation and ESH REIT repurchased and retired their respective portion of 1.95 million additional Paired Shares for approximately $27.6 million. 
  On October 25, 2016, the Board of Directors of ESH REIT declared a cash distribution of $0.03 per Class A and Class B common share for the third quarter of 2016. Additionally, the Board of Directors of the Corporation declared a cash distribution of $0.16 per common share for the third quarter of 2016. These distributions, which total $0.19 per Paired Share, are payable on November 22, 2016 to shareholders of record as of November 8, 2016. 
    
  The following table outlines distributions declared or paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

__  _________________ 
  (1) Special distribution. 
  In the future, we intend to maintain our current distribution of $0.19 per Paired Share per quarter unless our consolidated results of operations, net income, Adjusted EBITDA, liquidity, cash flows, financial condition or prospects, economic conditions or other factors differ materially from our current assumptions. We intend to make a significant portion of our expected total annual distributions in respect of the Class B common stock of ESH REIT.  In the event distributions in respect of the Class B common stock of ESH REIT are not sufficient to meet our expected Paired Share distributions and/or additional tax efficiency opportunities exist, the expected Paired Share distributions may be completed through distributions in respect of the common stock of the Corporation using funds distributed to the Corporation in respect of the Class A common stock of ESH REIT, after allowance for tax, if any, on those funds. See  Market for Registrants  Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities-Distribution Policies  in our combined annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 23, 2016 for a description of our distribution policies. 
  The Corporation 
  The Corporation s primary source of liquidity is distribution income it receives in respect of its ownership of approximately 55% of the common stock of ESH REIT. Other sources of liquidity include income from the operations of the Operating Lessees, ESA Management and ESH Strategies. 
  The Corporation has accumulated, and we expect that it will continue to accumulate, cash. We expect that it will continue to distribute cash to its common shareholders, and that from time to time it will continue to return cash to ESH REIT in order to fund the renovation, acquisition, development or construction of new hotels, the repayment of debt and for other corporate purposes. The Corporation may transfer cash to ESH REIT through the purchase of additional shares of Class A common stock, which would increase its ownership of ESH REIT and therefore reduce the Company s overall tax efficiency.

In August 2016, the Corporation loaned $75.0 million to ESH REIT through the Unsecured Intercompany Facility. The Corporation may in the future loan additional funds to ESH REIT through the Unsecured Intercompany Facility or an additional intercompany facility, subject to the conditions contained in the 2016 ESH REIT Credit Facilities, the 2025 Notes and the Unsecured Intercompany Facility. The Corporation s long-term liquidity requirements will also include the repayment of any outstanding amounts under the 2016 Corporation Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 7 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Extended Stay America, Inc., which is included in Item 1 in this combined quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 
  The Corporation is expected to continue to pay distributions on its common stock to meet a portion of our expected distribution rate on our Paired Shares. The Corporation's ability to pay distributions is dependent upon its results of operations, net income, liquidity, cash flows, financial condition or prospects, economic conditions, the ability to effectively execute certain tax planning strategies, compliance with applicable law, the receipt by the Corporation of distributions from ESH REIT in respect of the Class A common stock, level of indebtedness, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions in any existing and future debt agreements of the Corporation and ESH REIT and other factors. The payment of distributions in the future will be at the discretion of the Corporation s Board of Directors.  
  Based upon the current level of operations, management believes that the Corporation s cash position, cash flow generated from operations and available borrowings under the Corporation's revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet all of the Corporation s funding requirements and business objectives for the foreseeable future.  
  ESH REIT 
  ESH REIT s primary source of liquidity is rental revenues derived from leases with the Operating Lessees. ESH REIT s primary uses of liquidity are fixed costs associated with ownership of the hotel properties, including interest expense, scheduled principal payments on its outstanding indebtedness, real estate tax expense, property insurance premium and claims expense, general and administrative expenses (including administrative costs reimbursed to the Corporation), capital expenditures, including those capital expenditures related to our hotel renovation program, and the payment of distributions. Other long-term liquidity requirements are expected to include the need to obtain funds to acquire, develop or construct additional hotels. In order to qualify and maintain its status as a REIT, ESH REIT must distribute annually to its shareholders an amount at least equal to: 

90% of its REIT taxable income, computed without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain; plus 
                
    90% of the excess of its net income, if any, from foreclosure property over the tax imposed on such income by the Code; less 
                
    the sum of certain items of non-cash income that exceeds a percentage of ESH REIT s income. 
     ESH REIT intends to distribute its taxable income to the extent necessary to optimize its tax efficiency, including, but not limited to, maintaining its REIT status, while retaining sufficient capital for its ongoing needs. Accordingly, ESH REIT expects to distribute approximately 100% of its taxable income for the foreseeable future. ESH REIT is subject to income tax on its taxable income that is not distributed and to an excise tax to the extent that certain percentages of its taxable income are not distributed by specified dates.  
  To the extent distributions in respect of the Class B common stock of ESH REIT are not sufficient to meet our expected Paired Share distributions, expected Paired Share distributions are expected to be completed through distributions in respect of the common stock of the Corporation using funds distributed to the Corporation in respect of the Class A common stock of ESH REIT, after allowance for tax, if any, on those funds.     
  Due to REIT distribution requirements, ESH REIT has historically not accumulated significant amounts of cash. As a result and as discussed above, we expect that ESH REIT will need to refinance all or a portion of its debt, including the 2016 ESH REIT Credit Facilities and the 2025 Notes, on or before maturity. ESH REIT s current liquidity requirements also include the repayment of any outstanding amounts under the 2016 ESH REIT Credit Facilities and the Unsecured Intercompany Facility. See Note 6 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of ESH Hospitality, Inc., which is included in Item 1 in this combined quarterly report on Form 10-Q. We cannot assure you that ESH REIT will be able to refinance any of its debt on attractive terms at or before maturity, on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

Based upon the current level of operations, management believes that ESH REIT s cash position, cash flow generated from operations and available borrowings under the 2016 ESH REIT Revolving Credit Facility and Unsecured Intercompany Facility will be adequate to meet all of ESH REIT s funding requirements and business objectives for the foreseeable future. 
  Sources and Uses of Cash   The Company 
  The following cash flow table and comparisons are provided for the Company: 
  Comparison of   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015    
  We had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of approximately $149.8 million and $107.5 million at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The following table summarizes the changes in our cash and cash equivalents as a result of operating, investing and financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands):   

  Cash Flows provided by Operating Activities 
  Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled approximately $336.0 million for the   nine   months ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately $365.2 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of approximately $29.2 million. Cash flows provided by operating activities decreased during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   mainly due to the Portfolio Sale and an increase in interest expense, which included approximately $5.0 million in prepayment penalties and other costs in connection with the repayment of ESH REIT's former term loan facility, as well as an increase in the use of short-term working capital. The decrease was partially offset by the positive impact related to improved Comparable Hotel operating performance.  
  Cash Flows used in Investing Activities 
  Cash flows used in investing activities totaled approximately $100.8 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to approximately $256.7 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of approximately $155.9 million. Cash flows used in investing activities decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to a decrease in restricted cash as a result of the repayment of ESH REIT s 2012 Mortgage Loan. Under the 2012 Mortgage Loan, substantially all hotel revenues were deposited into cash management accounts under the control of the loan service agent and were therefore classified as restricted cash on the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2015. The decrease was offset by an increase in purchases of property and equipment due to additional hotel renovation activity.  The increased hotel renovation activity is evidenced by the fact that approximately 243,000 room nights, or 1.3% of total available room nights, were displaced from renovation during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately 231,000 room nights, or 1.1% of total available room nights, displaced from renovation during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
    
  Cash Flows used in Financing Activities 
  Cash flows used in financing activities totaled approximately $458.6 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to approximately $122.3 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an increase of approximately $336.3 million. Cash flows used in financing activities increased due to an increase in net loan repayments of approximately $202.4 million, the repurchase of approximately $69.6 million of Paired Shares as well as an increase in distributions paid to holders of Paired Shares of approximately $62.2 million.

Sources and Uses of Cash   ESH REIT 
  The following cash flow table and comparisons are provided for ESH REIT: 
  Comparison of   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015    
  ESH REIT had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of approximately $36.4 million and $33.4 million at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The following table summarizes the changes in ESH REIT s cash and cash equivalents as a result of operating, investing and financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands): 

Cash Flows provided by Operating Activities 
  Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled approximately $375.3 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to approximately $361.1 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an increase of approximately $14.2 million. Cash flows provided by operating activities increased due to a decrease in the use of short-term working capital offset by an increase in interest expense, which included approximately $5.0 million in prepayment penalties and other costs in connection with the repayment of ESH REIT s former term loan facility, and the sale of the portfolio of 53 hotels in December 2015. 
    
  Cash Flows used in Investing Activities 
  Cash flows used in investing activities totaled approximately $100.9 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to approximately $251.3 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of approximately $150.5 million. Cash flows used in investing activities decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to a decrease in restricted cash as a result of the repayment of ESH REIT s 2012 Mortgage Loan. Under the 2012 Mortgage Loan, substantially all hotel revenues were deposited into cash management accounts under the control of the loan service agent and were therefore classified as restricted cash on ESH REIT s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2015. The decrease was offset by an increase in purchases of property and equipment due to additional hotel renovation activity.   
  Cash Flows used in Financing Activities 
  Cash flows used in financing activities totaled approximately $461.2 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to approximately $110.1 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an increase of approximately $351.1 million. Cash flows used in financing activities increased due to an increase in net loan repayments of approximately $127.2 million, an increase in distributions paid to holders of Class A and Class B common shares of approximately $63.0 million and the repurchase of approximately $27.0 million of shares of ESH REIT Class B common stock. 
  Capital Expenditures 
  We maintain each of our hotels in good repair and condition and in conformity with applicable laws and regulations. The cost of all improvements and significant alterations are generally made with cash flows from operations. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we incurred capital expenditures of approximately $166.5 million and $141.2 million, respectively. These capital expenditures were primarily made as a result of our hotel renovation program, which remains ongoing. Funding for future capital expenditures is expected to be provided primarily from cash flows generated from operations or, to the extent necessary, the Corporation or ESH REIT revolving credit facilities, including the Unsecured Intercompany Facility. In   2016  , we expect to incur capital expenditures between $220.0 million and $235.0 million, including amounts spent through the third quarter.

Hotel Renovation Program 
  Since 2011, we have been performing a significant number of hotel renovations and have been executing a phased capital investment program across our portfolio in order to seek to drive increases in ADR and incremental market share gains. We have developed a methodology for selecting specific hotels for our renovation program by evaluating potential returns based on multiple market and property specific variables. Prior to undertaking capital investment at a hotel, management determines whether, in its view, the investment is likely to result in incremental revenues and profits and achieve a return on investment that management believes would meet our return criteria. 
  A hotel renovation generally requires approximately $1.0 million in capital spend per hotel. Hotel renovations typically include remodeling of common areas, new paint, carpet, signage, tile or vinyl flooring and counters in bathrooms and kitchens, as well as the refurbishment of furniture, replacement of aged mattresses and installation of new flat screen televisions, artwork, lighting and bedspreads. 
  We have undertaken our hotel renovation program in phases. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have substantially completed renovations at 547 hotels, with total incurred costs of approximately $542.3 million. Also, as of   September 30, 2016  , we are in the process of implementing renovations at an additional 31 hotels and will begin renovations at an additional 15 hotels during the fourth quarter of   2016  , with combined estimated total costs of approximately $51.1 million. Renovations for all remaining Extended Stay America-branded hotels are expected to be completed by early 2017, with estimated total costs of approximately $38.9 million. 
  Our Indebtedness 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s total indebtedness was approximately $2.6 billion, including approximately $21.2 million of Corporation mandatorily redeemable preferred stock and ESH REIT indebtedness of approximately $2.6 billion. For a detailed discussion of our indebtedness during the periods presented, see Notes 7 and 9 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Extended Stay America, Inc. and Note 6 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of ESH Hospitality, Inc., both of which are included in Item 1 in this combined quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

  Neither the Corporation nor ESH REIT have off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. See Note 12 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Extended Stay America, Inc. and Note 10 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of ESH Hospitality, Inc., both of which are included in Item 1 in this combined quarterly report on Form 10-Q, for additional information with respect to lease and other commitments. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
  Our discussion and analysis of our historical financial condition and results of operations is based on the Company s and ESH REIT s historical unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions. We believe the following accounting policies, which are described in detail in Note 2 to each of the consolidated and combined financial statements of Extended Stay America, Inc. and the consolidated financial statements of ESH Hospitality, Inc., both of which are included in Item 8 in our combined annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 23, 2016, require material subjective or complex judgments and have the most significant impact on the Company s and ESH REIT s financial condition and results of operations: property and equipment, goodwill, revenue recognition, income taxes, equity-based compensation and investments. We evaluate estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis, based on information that is then available to us, our experience and various matters that we believe are reasonable and appropriate for consideration under the circumstances.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  For a discussion of recently issued accounting standards, see Note 2 to each of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Extended Stay America, Inc. and ESH Hospitality, Inc., both of which are included in Item 1 in this combined quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  Both the Corporation and ESH REIT may seek to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices by entering into financial arrangements to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility, when applicable. We will continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged. We enter into derivative financial arrangements to the extent they meet the foregoing objectives. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. 
  The Corporation 
           As of   September 30, 2016  , the Corporation had minimal exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates because it had no variable rate debt as there were no outstanding amounts drawn on the Corporation's revolving credit facility. The Corporation s exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates will increase in future periods should the Corporation incur variable rate debt, including draws on the Corporation's revolving credit facility. 
  ESH REIT 
            As of September 30, 2016, approximately $1.3 billion of ESH REIT s outstanding debt of approximately $2.6 billion had a variable interest rate. ESH REIT is a counterparty to a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap at a fixed rate of 1.175% with a $500.0 million amortizing notional amount and a maturity date of September 30, 2021. The remaining outstanding variable debt of approximately $825.0 million remains subject to interest rate risk (subject to a LIBOR floor of 0.75%). If market rates of interest on ESH REIT s variable rate debt fluctuate by 1.0%, interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately $6.4 million annually, assuming that the amount outstanding under ESH REIT s variable rate debt remains at approximately $825.0 million. 
       
            As of September 30, 2016, less than 1.5% of the book value of ESH REIT's hotels are owned outside the United States. ESH REIT has exposure to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates for its Canadian hotels. A fluctuation of 1.0% in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar would result in a foreign currency transaction gain or loss of approximately $0.2 million. As noted in Note 12 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of ESH Hospitality, Inc., which are included in Item 1 in this combined quarterly report on Form 10-Q, ESH REIT executed a purchase and sale agreement to divest its three Extended Stay Canada hotels for $76.0 million Canadian dollars. Until the transaction's expected closing in the first quarter of 2017, ESH REIT has exposure to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates for an amount up to the purchase price. Approximately $11.2 million is included in other comprehensive loss on the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of changes in equity as of September 30, 2016. Upon or prior to closing, this amount will be recorded as a charge against earnings.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, without prejudice to the other rights provided to Lessee under this Agreement, the Management Parties agree to: (i) permit Lessee and Parent to visit and inspect the Hotels and inspect and copy the books and records of the Management Parties, at such times as Lessee shall reasonably request; (ii) periodically (at least quarterly) provide Lessee and Parent with information and reports regarding the Management Parties  operation and management of the Hotels and the performance of its duties under this Agreement and with respect to renovations, alterations, general maintenance, repairs and development activities that the Management Parties have engaged in or intends to engage in with respect to the Hotels and their surroundings; (iii) periodically (at  
  
   -26- 

least quarterly) consult with Lessee and Parent in advance with respect to any significant leasing, management and development matters, as appropriate, including, without limitation, with respect to matters relating to renovations, alterations, general maintenance, repairs and development activities with respect to the Hotels and their surroundings and the management, participatory and development rights retained by Lessee under this Agreement; and (iv) to provide Lessee and Parent with such other rights as may reasonably be determined by Lessee to be necessary to enable Parent to qualify as a REOC, provided the rights described in clauses (i)-(iv) above do not materially adversely affect (X) the Management Parties  ability to perform their duties under this Agreement or the economic benefits enjoyed by the Management Parties under this Agreement or (Y) the status of ESH Hospitality as a real estate investment trust under the Code. The Management Parties agree to consider, in good faith, the recommendations of Lessee in connection with the matters on which it is consulted as described above.

At the expiration or sooner termination of the Term, Landlord may, in its sole and absolute discretion, elect either (a) to give Tenant Notice that Tenant shall be required, within 10 Business Days after such expiration or termination, to remove all Tenant s Personal Property from the Leased Property or (b) to buy Tenant s Personal Property by paying Tenant the book value of such property. Failure of Landlord to make such election shall be deemed an election to proceed in accordance with clause (b) of this Section 5.5. 
   
  5.6      Yield Up.    (a)  Upon the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease, Tenant shall vacate and surrender the Leased Property to Landlord in substantially the same condition in which the Leased Property was in on the Commencement Date, except as repaired, replaced, rebuilt, restored, altered, or added to as permitted or required by the provisions of this Lease, reasonable wear and tear and Condemnation (and casualty damage, in the event that this Lease is terminated following a casualty in accordance with Article 10) excepted.

  5.7      Management Agreement.    Except as otherwise provided below, Tenant shall not amend or modify the Management Agreement or replace the Manager without Landlord s prior written consent, which consent may be given or withheld by Landlord in its sole and absolute discretion. The terms of the Management Agreement (a) shall not, in Landlord s and its counsel s reasonable opinion, cause the Rent to fail to qualify as  rents from real property  within the meaning of Section 856(d) of the Code, and (b) shall expressly provide that if Landlord and its counsel reasonably conclude that the terms of the Management Agreement will have such an effect, then the terms of the Management Agreement will be modified so that the Management Agreement, in the reasonable opinion of Landlord and its counsel, does not cause the Rent to be so characterized under the Code; provided, that no such modifications shall affect the amount of the Management Fees (as defined in the Management Agreement) or the practical realization of the rights and benefits of the Manager thereunder. 
   
  5.8      Trademark License Agreements.    (a)  Tenant shall not operate, or permit Manager to operate, any Hotel under a trade name other than the trade names licensed to Tenant under the Trademark License Agreements, without the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent may be given or withheld by Landlord in its sole and absolute discretion. 
  (b)    To the extent any of the provisions of any Trademark License Agreement impose a greater obligation on Tenant than the corresponding provisions of this Lease, then Tenant shall be obligated to comply with, and to take all reasonable actions necessary to prevent breaches or defaults under, the provisions of such Trademark License Agreement. It is the intent of the parties hereto that, except as otherwise specifically provided by this Lease, Tenant shall comply in every respect with the provisions of any Trademark License Agreement to which Tenant is a party so as to avoid any default thereunder during the term of this Lease. Landlord and Tenant agree to cooperate fully with each other in the event it becomes necessary to obtain a trademark license extension or modification or a new trademark license for the Leased Property; provided, that Landlord shall pay the entire cost of any upgrades required by any licensor. 
   
  Article 6      IMPROVEMENTS, ETC. 
   
  6.1      Improvements to the Leased Property.    Tenant shall not finance the cost of any construction by the granting of a lien on, or security interest in, the Leased Property, or Tenant s interest therein, without the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent may be withheld by Landlord in Landlord s sole discretion. Any such improvements shall, upon the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease, remain or pass to and become the property of Landlord, free and clear of any encumbrance permitted to be created by Landlord. 
   
  6.2      Equipment Leases.    Landlord shall enter into such leases of equipment and personal property as Tenant may reasonably request from time to time; provided, that the form and substance thereof shall be reasonably satisfactory to Landlord.

Tenant shall, throughout the Term, be responsible for performing all of Landlord s obligations under all such documents and agreements. 
   
  Article 7      LIENS 
  Subject to Article 8, Tenant shall not, and Tenant shall ensure that Manager does not, directly or indirectly, create or allow to remain, and each shall promptly discharge, at its expense, any lien, encumbrance, attachment, title retention agreement, or claim upon the Leased Property or Tenant s leasehold interest therein or any attachment, levy, claim, or encumbrance in respect of the Rent, other than (a) restrictions, liens, and other encumbrances which are consented to in writing by Landlord, (b) liens for those taxes of Landlord which Tenant is not required to pay hereunder, (c) subleases permitted by Article 16, (d) liens for Impositions or for sums resulting from noncompliance with Legal Requirements so long as (i) the same are not yet due and payable, or (ii) are being contested in accordance with Article 8, (e liens of mechanics, laborers, materialmen, suppliers, or vendors incurred in the ordinary course of business that are not yet due and payable (but will be paid in full by Tenant or Manager) or are for sums that are being contested in accordance with Article 8, (f) any Mortgage or other liens which are the responsibility of Landlord, and (g) Landlord Liens. 
   
  Article 8      PERMITTED CONTESTS 
  Tenant, or Manager at Tenant s direction, shall have the right to contest the amount or validity of any Imposition, Legal Requirement, Insurance Requirement, lien, attachment, levy, encumbrance, charge, or claim (collectively,    Claims   ) as to the Leased Property, by appropriate legal proceedings, conducted in good faith and with due diligence; provided, that (a) the foregoing shall in no way be construed as relieving, modifying, or extending Tenant s obligation to pay any Claims required hereunder to be paid by Tenant as finally determined, (b) such contest shall not cause Landlord or Tenant to be in default under any mortgage, deed of trust, or other agreement encumbering the Leased Property or any part thereof (Landlord agreeing that any such mortgage, deed of trust, or other agreement shall permit Tenant to exercise the rights granted pursuant to this Article 8) or any interest therein or result in a lien attaching to the Leased Property, unless such lien is fully bonded or is otherwise secured to the reasonable satisfaction of Landlord, (c) no part of the Leased Property nor any Rent therefrom shall be in any immediate danger of sale, forfeiture, attachment, or loss, and (d) Tenant hereby indemnifies and holds harmless Landlord from and against any cost, claim, damage, penalty, or reasonable expense, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys  fees, incurred by Landlord in connection therewith or as a result thereof.

Tenant or Manager, as applicable, shall be entitled to any refund of any Claims and such charges and penalties or interest thereon which have been paid by Tenant or paid by Landlord to the extent that Landlord has been reimbursed by Tenant. If Tenant shall fail to pay or cause to be paid any Claims when finally determined, to provide reasonable security therefor, or to prosecute or cause to be prosecuted any such contest diligently and in good faith, then Landlord may, upon Notice to Tenant, pay such charges, together with interest and penalties due with respect thereto, and Tenant shall reimburse Landlord therefor, upon demand, as Additional Charges. 
   
  Article 9      INSURANCE 
   
  9.1      General Insurance Requirements.    (a)    Coverages by Landlord.    During the Term, Landlord shall at its expense, without reimbursement from Tenant, at all times keep the Leased Property insured (except to the extent such insurance is required to be kept by Tenant pursuant to Section 9.1(b)).  
  (b)      Coverages by Tenant.    During the Term, Tenant shall at its expense keep the insurance described in Sections 9.1(b)(i) through (v). This insurance shall be written by companies authorized to issue insurance in the applicable state and otherwise acceptable to Landlord. If required by Landlord, the policies must name Landlord as an additional named insured. 
  (i)    Fidelity bonds with limits and deductibles as may be reasonably required by Landlord, covering Tenant s employees in job classifications normally bonded under prudent hotel management practices in the United States or otherwise required by law.

  9.2      Waiver of Subrogation.    All insurance policies carried by Landlord or Tenant covering the Leased Property, the FF E, the Hotels, or Tenant s Personal Property, including, without limitation, contents, fire, and casualty insurance, shall expressly waive any right of subrogation on the part of the insurer against the other party. The parties hereto agree that their policies will include such waiver clause or endorsement so long as the same are obtainable without extra cost, and in the event of such an extra cost the other party, at its election, may pay the same, but shall not be obligated to do so. Each party agrees to seek recovery from any applicable insurance coverage prior to seeking recovery against the other. 
   
  9.3      Form Satisfactory, Etc.    All of the policies of insurance referred to in this Article 9 shall be written in a form, with deductibles and by insurance companies reasonably satisfactory to Landlord and also shall meet and satisfy the requirements of any ground lessor, lender, or franchisor having any interest in the Leased Property. Tenant shall deliver to Landlord policies or certificates of the insurance required under Section 9.1(b) as of their effective date (and, with respect to any renewal policy, upon or prior to the expiration of the existing policy), and in the event of the failure of Tenant either to obtain such insurance as herein called for or to pay the premiums therefor, or to deliver such policies or certificates thereof to Landlord at the times required, Landlord shall be entitled, but shall have no obligation, to obtain such insurance and pay the premiums therefor, and Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for any premium or premiums paid by Landlord for the coverages required under Section 9.1(b) upon written demand therefor, and repay the same within 30 days after Notice of such failure from Landlord shall constitute an Event of Default. Each insurer mentioned in this Article 9 shall agree, by endorsement to the policy or policies issued by it, or by independent instrument furnished to Landlord, to provide 30 days  written notice to Landlord before the policy or policies in question shall be materially altered, allowed to expire, or canceled. 
   
  9.4      Blanket Policy.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article 9, Tenant or Landlord may bring the insurance provided for herein within the coverage of a so-called blanket policy or policies of insurance carried and maintained by Tenant or Landlord; provided, that the coverage afforded to Landlord and Tenant will not be reduced or diminished or otherwise be different from that which would exist under a separate policy meeting all other requirements of this Lease by reason of the use of such blanket policy of insurance; and provided further, that the requirements of this Article 9 are otherwise satisfied. 
   
  9.5      Separate Insurance.    Tenant shall not on Tenant s own or pursuant to the request or requirement of any third party, take out separate insurance concurrent in form or contributing in the event of loss with that required in this Article 9 to be furnished, or increase the amount of any then existing insurance by securing an additional policy or additional policies, unless all parties having an insurable interest in the subject matter of the insurance, including, without limitation, and in all cases, Landlord, are each included therein as an additional insured, and the loss is payable under such additional separate insurance in the same manner as losses are payable under this Lease. Tenant shall immediately provide Notice to Landlord that Tenant has obtained any such separate insurance or of the increasing of any of the amounts of the then existing insurance. 
   
  9.6      Reports on Insurance Claims.    Tenant shall promptly investigate and make a complete and timely written report to the appropriate insurance company as to all accidents, claims for damage relating to the ownership, operation, and maintenance of any Hotel, any damage or destruction to any Hotel, and the estimated cost of repair thereof, and shall prepare any and all reports required by any insurance company in connection therewith. All such reports shall be timely filed with the insurance company as required under the terms of the insurance policy involved, and a final copy of such report shall be furnished to Landlord. 
   
  9.7      Indemnification of Landlord.    Except as expressly provided herein, Tenant shall protect, indemnify, and hold harmless Landlord for, from, and against all liabilities, obligations, claims, damages, penalties, causes of action, costs, and reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys  fees), to the maximum extent permitted by law, imposed upon or incurred by or asserted against Landlord by reason of: (a) any accident, injury to, or death of persons, or loss of or damage to property of third parties, occurring during the Term on or about the Leased Property or adjoining sidewalks or rights of way under Tenant s control, and (b) any use, misuse, condition, management, maintenance, or repair by Tenant or anyone claiming under Tenant of the Leased Property or Tenant s Personal Property during the Term, or any litigation, proceeding, or claim by governmental entities to which Landlord is made a party or participant relating to such use, misuse, condition, management, maintenance, or repair; provided, that Tenant s obligations hereunder shall not apply to any liability, obligation, claim, damage, penalty, cause of action, cost, or expense arising from any gross negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord, its employees, agents, contractors, or invitees. Tenant, at its expense, shall defend any such claim, action, or proceeding asserted or instituted against Landlord covered under this indemnity (and shall not be responsible for any duplicative attorneys  fees incurred by Landlord) or may compromise or otherwise dispose of the same. The obligations of Tenant under this Section 9.7 shall survive the termination of this Lease for a period of one year. 
   
  Article 10      DAMAGE, REPAIR, AND CONDEMNATION 
   
  10.1      Damage and Repair.    (a)  If, during the Term, a Hotel is damaged by a Minor Casualty, then Tenant shall proceed, or cause Manager to proceed, with all reasonable diligence, to process the claim with the applicable insurance carriers, including, without limitation, settling such claim, and to make the necessary arrangements with appropriate contractors and suppliers to repair and/or replace the damaged portion of such Hotel. Landlord s consent shall not be needed for Tenant or Manager to perform any of the foregoing, all of which shall be performed in accordance with Tenant s reasonable judgment; provided, that all such work shall be undertaken (i) in a workmanlike manner, (ii) in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.3, and (iii) in accordance with plans and specifications approved by Landlord (which approval or disapproval shall be made within 10 Business Days after Landlord receives the applicable plans or specifications and, if applicable, within 10 Business Days after Landlord receives any modifications of said plans or specifications to accommodate Landlord s comments); provided, that the parties agree that the standard for such repair and/or replacement shall be to repair and/or replace the damaged portion of such Hotel to levels of quality and quantity that are equal to those that existed with respect to such portion of such Hotel prior to the occurrence of the damage at issue. Landlord agrees to sign promptly any documents which are necessary to process and/or adjust the claim with the insurance carriers, as well as any contracts with such contractors and/or suppliers. 
  (b)    If, during the Term, a Hotel suffers a Total Casualty, then Landlord shall, at its cost and expense and with all reasonable diligence, repair and/or replace the damaged portion of such Hotel to the same condition as existed previously. Such damage or destruction shall not terminate this Lease. Notwithstanding any provisions of this Article 10 to the contrary, if a Hotel suffers a Total Casualty during the last 24 months of the Term, then either party shall have the right to terminate this Lease with respect to such Hotel by giving Notice to the other within 30 days after the date of damage or destruction, whereupon all accrued Rent with respect to such Hotel shall be paid immediately, this Lease shall automatically terminate with respect to such Hotel five (5) days after the date of such Notice and, upon such termination, Minimum Rent payable hereunder shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Minimum Rent allocated to the applicable Hotel set forth in Exhibit A and the Thresholds shall be reduced by the applicable Threshold Allocation.    Threshold Allocation    means (only for purposes of this Article 10), with respect to any applicable Hotel and as applied to the Thresholds, an amount calculated by multiplying the Thresholds by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Minimum Rent allocated to the applicable Hotel as set forth in Exhibit A, and the denominator of which is the aggregate Minimum Rent for all of the Hotels as set forth in Exhibit A. 
  (c)    If, during the Term, a Hotel is damaged by fire, casualty, or other cause to a greater extent than a Minor Casualty, but not to the extent of a Total Casualty, then Landlord shall, at its cost and expense and with all reasonable diligence, repair and/or replace the damaged portion of such Hotel to the same condition as existed previously. Tenant shall have the right to discontinue operating, or cause Manager to discontinue operating, the Hotel to the extent Tenant deems necessary to comply with applicable Legal Requirements or as necessary for the safe and orderly operation of such Hotel. To the extent available, proceeds from the insurance described in Section 9.1 of this Lease shall be applied to such repairs and/or replacements. The parties agree that Landlord s obligations to repair and/or replace pursuant to the provisions of this Section 10.1(c) shall be limited to the extent of available insurance proceeds (plus the amount of any applicable deductibles). The parties further agree that if Landlord is obligated to utilize such available insurance proceeds to repay any obligations pursuant to any Mortgage, then Landlord shall be entitled to an equitable extension of time (in which Landlord has to fulfill its obligations pursuant to the provisions of this Section 10.1(c)) that is sufficient to allow Landlord to obtain the necessary funding to replace such spent insurance proceeds and to make the repairs and/or replacements required hereunder. The parties further agree that Landlord s obligations to repair and/or replace pursuant to the provisions of this Section 10.1(c) shall be subject to Landlord s ability to obtain such entitlements and/or other governmental approvals as may be necessary to undertake such repair and/or replacement; provided, that Landlord shall undertake good faith efforts to obtain such entitlements and/or approvals. 
  (d)    All insurance proceeds payable by reason of any loss of or damage to any of Tenant s Personal Property shall be paid to Tenant, and, to the extent necessary to repair or replace Tenant s Personal Property in accordance with this Section 10.1(d), Tenant shall hold such proceeds to pay the cost of repairing or replacing damaged Tenant s Personal Property and, if this Lease terminates, pay the same over to Landlord. If Landlord undertakes to restore the Leased Property as hereinabove provided, then Tenant shall either (i) restore all of Tenant s Personal Property, if any, or (ii) replace Tenant s Personal Property, if any, with items of the same or better quality and utility to the operation of the Leased Property. 
   
  10.2      Condemnation.    (a)  In the event all or substantially all of a Hotel shall be taken in any eminent domain, condemnation, compulsory acquisition, or similar proceeding by any competent authority for any public or quasi-public use or purpose, or in the event a portion of a Hotel shall be so taken, but the result is that it is unreasonable to continue to operate such Hotel in accordance with the standards required by this Lease, this Lease shall terminate with respect to such Hotel as of the date of the taking and, upon such termination, Minimum Rent payable hereunder shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Minimum Rent allocated to the applicable Hotel set forth in Exhibit A and the Thresholds shall be reduced by the applicable Threshold Allocation. Landlord and Tenant shall each have the right to initiate such proceedings as they deem advisable to recover any compensation to which they may be entitled. 
  (b)    In the event a portion of a Hotel shall be taken by the events described in Section   10.2(a)  , or an entire Hotel is affected but on a temporary basis, and the result is not to make it unreasonable to continue to operate such Hotel, this Lease shall not terminate, but the Rent due hereunder shall be equitably abated taking into consideration, among other relevant factors, the number of useable rooms, the amount of square footage, or revenues affected or taken by such events. However, so much of any Award for any such partial taking or condemnation as shall be necessary to render the Hotel equivalent to its condition prior to such event shall be used for such purpose and Tenant shall have the right to discontinue operating, or to cause Manager to discontinue operating, the Hotel or portion of the Hotel to the extent it deems necessary for the safe and orderly operation of the Hotel. 
   
  Article 11      CC Rs, LIENS, ETC. 
   
  11.1      No Covenants, Conditions, or Restrictions.    (a)  Landlord covenants that after the Commencement Date and during the Term, there will not be (unless Tenant has given its prior consent thereto) any covenants, conditions, or restrictions, including, without limitation, reciprocal easement agreements or cost-sharing arrangements (individually or collectively referred to as    CC R(s)   ) affecting the Leased Property (i) which would prohibit Manager s operation of the Hotels in accordance with the terms of this Lease and the Management Agreement, including, without limitation, related amenities proposed for the Hotels; (ii) which would allow the Hotels  facilities (for example, parking spaces) to be used by persons other than guests, invitees, or employees of the Hotels except as approved by Tenant; (iii) which would allow the Hotels  facilities to be used for specified charges or rates which have not been approved by Manager; or (iv) which would subject the Hotels to exclusive arrangements regarding food and beverage operation or retail merchandise. 
  (b)    Tenant shall cause Manager to manage and operate the Hotels in compliance with all obligations imposed on Landlord or the Hotels pursuant to any CC Rs to the extent (i) such obligations are known to Manager (ii) such CC Rs relate to the management and operation of the Hotels and (iii) the CC Rs are not inconsistent with the Management Agreement. 
   
  11.2      Liens; Credit.    Tenant shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent any liens from being filed against the Hotels which arise from any maintenance, repairs, alterations, improvements, renewals, or replacements in or to the Hotels, and shall cooperate fully in obtaining the release of any such liens. 
   
  11.3      Amendments Requested by Mortgagee.    If requested by any Mortgagee or prospective Mortgagee, Tenant agrees to execute and deliver any amendment of this Lease that is reasonably required by such Mortgagee or prospective Mortgagee; provided, that Tenant shall be under no obligation to amend this Lease if the result of such amendment would be to materially and adversely increase Tenant s obligations or to materially and adversely affect Tenant s rights under this Lease or to amend Article 5. Any such amendment shall be in effect only for the period of time in which such Mortgage is outstanding. 
   
  Article 12      DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES 
   
  12.1      Events of Default.    The occurrence of any one or more of the following events shall constitute an    Event of Default    hereunder: 
  (a)    should Tenant fail to make any payment of Minimum Rent or Percentage Rent within 5 Business Days after Notice thereof, or fail to make payment of any other Rent or any other sum payable hereunder when due and such failure shall continue for a period of 30 days after Notice thereof; 
  (b)    should Tenant fail to maintain the insurance coverages required under Article 9 and such failure shall continue for 10 Business Days after Notice thereof; 
  (c)    subject to Article 8 relating to permitted contests, should Tenant default in the due observance or performance of any of the terms, covenants, or agreements contained herein to be performed or observed by it (other than as specified in clauses (a) and (b) above) and such default shall continue for a period of 30 days after Notice thereof from Landlord to Tenant; provided, that if such default is susceptible of cure but such cure cannot be accomplished with due diligence within such period of time, and if, in addition, Tenant commences to cure or cause to be cured such default within 30 days after Notice thereof from Landlord and thereafter prosecutes the curing of such default with all due diligence, then such period of time shall be extended to such period of time (not to exceed 90 days) as may be necessary to cure such default with all due diligence; 
  (d)    should Tenant generally not be paying its debts as they become due or should Tenant make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; 
  (e)    should any petition be filed by or against Tenant under the Federal bankruptcy laws, or should any other proceeding be instituted by or against Tenant seeking to adjudicate it a bankrupt or insolvent, or seeking liquidation, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, or composition of it or its debts under any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization or relief of debtors, or seeking the entry of an order for relief or the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, or other similar official for Tenant or for any substantial part of the property of Tenant and such proceeding is not dismissed within 60 days after institution thereof, or should Tenant take any action to authorize any of the actions set forth above in this paragraph; 
  (f)    should Tenant cause or institute any proceeding for its dissolution or termination; 
  (g)    unless Tenant shall be contesting such lien or attachment in good faith in accordance with Article 8, should the estate or interest of Tenant in the Leased Property or any part thereof be levied upon or attached in any proceeding and the same shall not be vacated, discharged, or fully bonded or otherwise secured to the reasonable satisfaction of Landlord within the later of (i) 60 days after such attachment or levy, unless the amount in dispute is less than $100,000.00 (as adjusted each year by increases or decreases in the Index), in which case Tenant shall give notice to Landlord of the dispute but Tenant may defend in any suitable way, and (ii) 30 days after receipt by Tenant of Notice thereof from Landlord; it being understood and agreed that Tenant may commence a contest of such matter pursuant to Article 8 above following such Notice from Landlord; or 
  (h)    should Tenant be in default under the Management Agreement beyond any applicable cure period, 
  then, and in any such event, Landlord, in addition to all other remedies available to it, may terminate this Lease by giving Notice thereof to Tenant and upon the expiration of the time fixed in such Notice, this Lease shall terminate and all rights of Tenant under this Lease shall cease. Landlord shall have and may exercise all rights and remedies available at law and in equity to Landlord as a result of Tenant s breach of this Lease, including, without limitation, the right of re-entry upon the Leased Property upon and at any time after the occurrence of an Event of Default. 
   
  12.2      Damages.    Neither the termination of this Lease, the repossession of the Leased Property, the failure of Landlord to relet the Leased Property, nor the reletting of all or any portion thereof shall relieve Tenant of its liability and obligations hereunder, all of which shall survive any such termination, repossession, or reletting to the maximum extent permitted by law. In the event of any such termination, Tenant shall forthwith pay to Landlord all Rent due and payable with respect to the Leased Property to and including the date of such termination. In addition, Tenant shall forthwith pay to Landlord, at Landlord s option, as and for liquidated and agreed current damages for Tenant s default, either: 
  (a)    Without termination of Tenant s rights to possession of the Leased Property, each installment of Rent (including Default Rent as determined below) and other sums payable to Tenant by Landlord under this Lease as the same becomes due and payable, which Rent and other sums shall bear interest at the Interest Rate from the date due until paid or otherwise discharged, and Landlord may enforce, by action or otherwise, any other term or covenant of this Lease; or 
  (b)    the sum of: 
  (i)    the unpaid Rent which had been earned at the time of termination, repossession, or reletting, and 
  (ii)    the worth at the time of termination, repossession, or reletting of the amount by which the unpaid Rent for the balance of the Term after the time of termination, repossession, or reletting, exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves could be reasonably avoided and as reduced for rentals received after the time of termination, repossession, or reletting, if and to the extent required by applicable law (the  worth at the time of termination, repossession, or reletting  of the amount referred to in this subparagraph (ii) is computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at the time of award plus 1%), and 
  (iii)    any other amount necessary to compensate Landlord for all the detriment proximately caused by Tenant s failure to perform its obligations under this Lease or which, in the ordinary course, would be likely to result therefrom. 
     Default Rent    for the purposes of this Section 12.2 shall be a sum equal to (A) the average of the annual amounts of the Percentage Rent for the three Fiscal Years immediately preceding the Fiscal Year in which the termination, re-entry, or repossession takes place, or (B) if three Fiscal Years shall not have elapsed, the average of the Percentage Rent during the preceding Fiscal Years during which this Lease was in effect, or (C) if one Fiscal Year has not elapsed, the amount derived by annualizing the Percentage Rent from the Commencement Date. 
   
  12.3      Waiver of Jury Trial.    Landlord and Tenant hereby waive, to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Laws, trial by jury in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim brought by either of the parties hereto against the other or in respect of any matter whatsoever arising out of or in any way connected with this Lease, the relationship of Landlord and Tenant hereunder, Tenant s occupancy of the Leased Property, and/or any claim for injury or damage. 
   
  12.4      Application of Funds.    Any payments received by Landlord under any of the provisions of this Lease during the existence or continuance of any Event of Default (and any payment made to Landlord rather than Tenant due to the existence of any Event of Default) shall be applied to Tenant s current and past due obligations under this Lease in such order as Landlord may determine or as may be required by Applicable Laws. 
   
  12.5      Landlord s Right to Cure Tenant s Default.    If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, then Landlord, after Notice to Tenant with a courtesy copy to Manager (which Notice shall not be required if Landlord shall reasonably determine immediate action is necessary to protect person or property), without waiving or releasing any obligation of Tenant and without waiving or releasing any Event of Default, may (but shall not be obligated to), at any time thereafter, make such payment or perform such act for the account and at the expense of Tenant, and may, to the maximum extent permitted by law, enter upon the Leased Property or any portion thereof for such purpose and take all such action thereon as, in Landlord s sole and absolute discretion, may be necessary or appropriate therefor. No such entry shall be deemed an eviction of Tenant. All reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys  fees) incurred by Landlord in connection therewith, together with interest thereon (to the extent permitted by law) at the Interest Rate from the date such sums are paid by Landlord until repaid, shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord, on demand. 
   
  12.6      Good Faith Dispute.    If Tenant shall in good faith dispute the occurrence of any Default, then Tenant, before the expiration of the applicable cure period, shall give Notice thereof to Landlord, setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor and (provided Tenant shall escrow disputed amounts, if any, pursuant to an escrow arrangement reasonably acceptable to Landlord and Tenant) no Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred; provided, that in the event of any eventual adverse determination, Tenant shall pay to Landlord interest on any disputed funds at the Interest Rate, from the date demand for such funds was made by Landlord until the date of final adverse determination and, thereafter, at the Interest Rate until paid. 
   
  Article 13      HOLDING OVER 
  Any holding over by Tenant after the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease shall be treated as a daily tenancy at sufferance at a rate equal to twice the Rent and other charges herein provided (prorated on a daily basis). Tenant shall also pay to Landlord all damages (direct or indirect) sustained by reason of any such holding over. Otherwise, such holding over shall be on the terms and conditions set forth in this Lease, to the extent applicable. Nothing contained herein shall constitute the consent, express, or implied, of Landlord to the holding over of Tenant after the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease. 
   
  Article 14      LANDLORD S NOTICE OBLIGATIONS; LANDLORD S DEFAULT 
   
  14.1      Landlord s Notice Obligation.    Landlord shall give prompt Notice to Tenant and the Manager of any materially adverse matters affecting the Leased Property of which Landlord receives written notice or actual, conscious, present knowledge, and, to the extent Tenant and/or Manager otherwise has no notice or actual knowledge thereof, Landlord shall be liable for any liabilities, costs, damages, or claims (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys  fees) arising from the failure to deliver such Notice to Tenant. As used in this Lease,  Landlord s knowledge  or words of similar import shall mean the actual (and not constructive or imputed), conscious, present knowledge, without independent investigation or inquiry of William D. Rahm, Vivek Melwani, A.J. Agarwal, Tyler Henritze, Michael Barr, and Daniel Kamensky. 
   
  14.2      Landlord s Default.    (a)  It shall be a breach of this Lease if Landlord fails to observe or perform any term, covenant, or condition of this Lease on its part to be performed and such failure continues for a period of 30 days after Notice thereof from Tenant, unless such failure cannot with due diligence be cured within a period of 30 days, in which case such failure shall not be deemed a breach if Landlord proceeds within such 30 day period, with due diligence, to commence to cure the failure and thereafter diligently completes the curing thereof. The time within which Landlord shall be obligated to cure any such failure also shall be subject to extension of time due to the occurrence of any Unavoidable Delay. If Landlord does not cure any such failure within the applicable time period as aforesaid, then Tenant may declare the existence of a    Landlord Default    by a second Notice to Landlord. Thereafter, Tenant may forthwith cure the same. Tenant shall have no right to terminate this Lease for any Landlord Default and no right, for any such Landlord Default, to offset or counterclaim against any Rent or other charges due hereunder. 
  (b)    If Landlord shall in good faith dispute the occurrence of a Landlord Default and Landlord, before the expiration of the applicable cure period, shall give Notice thereof to Tenant setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor, then no Landlord Default shall be deemed to have occurred and Landlord shall have no obligation with respect thereto until final adverse determination thereof, whether through arbitration or otherwise; provided, that in the event of any such adverse determination, Landlord shall pay to Tenant interest on any disputed funds at the Interest Rate, from the date demand for such funds was made by Tenant until the date of final adverse determination and, thereafter, at the Interest Rate until paid. If Tenant and Landlord shall fail, in good faith, to resolve any such dispute within 30 days after Landlord s Notice of dispute, then either may submit the matter for determination by arbitration, but only if such matter is required to be submitted to arbitration pursuant to any provision of this Lease, or otherwise by a court of competent jurisdiction. 
   
  14.3      Tenant s Right to Cure.    Subject to the provisions of Section 14.2, if Landlord breaches any covenant to be performed by it under this Lease, then Tenant after Notice to and demand upon Landlord as provided in Section 14.2, without waiving or releasing any obligation hereunder, may (but shall be under no obligation at any time thereafter to) make such payment or perform such act for the account and at the expense of Landlord. All sums so paid by Tenant and all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys  fees) so incurred, together with interest thereon at the Interest Rate from the date on which such sums or expenses are paid or incurred by Tenant, shall be paid by Landlord, to Tenant on demand. The rights of Tenant hereunder to cure and to secure payment from Landlord in accordance with this Section 14.3 shall survive the termination of this Lease with respect to the Leased Property. 
   
  Article 15      TRANSFERS BY LANDLORD 
  Tenant acknowledges and agrees that Landlord has the unrestricted right to mortgage, encumber, convey and assign its interest in the Leased Property.  Tenant agrees and acknowledges that, at the request of Landlord and in consideration for the granting of the Leased Property to Tenant, Tenant shall enter into and execute certain documents, agreements or instruments to mortgage, encumber, convey and assign its interest in the Leased Property to further secure any financing obtained by Landlord.  If Landlord conveys the Leased Property in accordance with the terms hereof to a Mortgagee, or to a grantee or transferee that expressly assumes in writing all obligations of Landlord hereunder arising or accruing from and after the date of such conveyance or transfer, then Landlord shall thereupon be released from all future liabilities and obligations of Landlord under this Lease arising or accruing from and after the date of such conveyance or other transfer as to the Leased Property and all such future liabilities and obligations shall thereupon be binding upon the new owner. 
   
  Article 16      SUBLETTING AND ASSIGNMENT 
   
  16.1      Subletting and Assignment.    (a)  Except as provided in Section 16.3 and in this Section 16.1, Tenant shall not, without Landlord s prior written consent (which may be given or withheld by Landlord in its sole discretion), assign, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate, encumber, or otherwise transfer this Lease or sublease (which term shall be deemed to include the granting of concessions, licenses, and the like), all or any part of the Leased Property or suffer or permit this Lease or the leasehold estate created hereby or any other rights arising under this Lease to be assigned, transferred, mortgaged, pledged, hypothecated, or encumbered, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily, involuntarily, or by operation of law, or permit the use or operation of the Leased Property by anyone other than Tenant (but the foregoing is not to be construed to limit the Permitted Use or to restrict Tenant from engaging, or limit the requirement of Tenant to engage, Manager or other hotel manager), or the Leased Property to be offered or advertised for assignment or subletting. For purposes of this Section 16.1, an assignment of this Lease shall be deemed to include the following: without Landlord s consent, any direct or indirect transfer of any interest in Tenant or any transaction pursuant to which Tenant is merged or consolidated with another Entity or pursuant to which all or substantially all of Tenant s assets are transferred to any other Entity, as if such change in control or transaction were an assignment of this Lease but shall not include any involuntary liens or attachments contested by Tenant in good faith in accordance with Article 8. 
  (b)    If this Lease is assigned or if the Leased Property or any part thereof is sublet (or occupied by anybody other than Tenant hereunder), then Landlord may collect the rents from such assignee, subtenant, or occupant, as the case may be, and apply the net amount collected to the Rent herein reserved, but no such collection shall be deemed a waiver of the provisions set forth in the first paragraph of Section 16.1, the acceptance by Landlord of such assignee, subtenant, or occupant, as the case may be, as a tenant, or a release of Tenant from the future performance by Tenant of its covenants, agreements, or obligations contained in this Lease. 
  (c)    No subletting or assignment shall in any way impair the continuing primary liability of Tenant hereunder (unless Landlord and Tenant expressly otherwise agree that Tenant shall be released from all obligations hereunder), and no consent to any subletting or assignment in a particular instance shall be deemed to be a waiver of the prohibition set forth in Section 16.1. No assignment, subletting, or occupancy shall affect any Permitted Use. Any subletting, assignment, or other transfer of Tenant s interest under this Lease in contravention of Section 16.1 shall be voidable at Landlord s option. 
   
  16.2      Required Sublease Provisions.    Any sublease of any portion of the Leased Property entered into on or after the date hereof shall provide (a) that it is subject and subordinate to this Lease and to the matters to which this Lease is or shall be subject or subordinate; (b) that in the event of termination of this Lease or reentry or dispossession of Tenant by Landlord under this Lease, Landlord may, at its option, terminate such sublease or take over all of the right, title, and interest of Tenant, as sublessor under such sublease, and, except as provided below, such subtenant shall, at Landlord s option, attorn to Landlord pursuant to the then executory provisions of such sublease, except that neither Landlord nor any Mortgagee, as holder of a mortgage or as Landlord under this Lease, if such Mortgagee succeeds to that position, shall (i) be liable for any act or omission of Tenant under such sublease, (ii) be subject to any credit, counterclaim, offset, or defense which theretofore accrued to such subtenant against Tenant, (iii) be bound by any previous prepayment of more than one Accounting Period, (iv) be bound by any covenant of Tenant to undertake or complete any construction of the Leased Property or any portion thereof, (v) be required to account for any security deposit of the subtenant other than any security deposit actually delivered to Landlord by Tenant, (vi) be bound by any obligation to make any payment to such subtenant or grant any credits, except for services, repairs, maintenance, and restoration provided for under the sublease that are performed after the date of such attornment; (vii) be responsible for any monies owing by Tenant to the credit of such subtenant, or (viii) be required to remove any Person occupying any portion of the Leased Property; and (c) in the event that such subtenant receives a written Notice from Landlord or any Mortgagee stating that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such subtenant shall thereafter be obligated to pay all rentals accruing under such sublease directly to the party giving such Notice or as such party may direct. All rentals received from such subtenant by Landlord or the Mortgagee, as the case may be, shall be credited against the amounts owing by Tenant under this Lease and such sublease shall provide that the subtenant thereunder shall, at the request of Landlord, execute a suitable instrument in confirmation of such agreement to attorn. An original counterpart of each such sublease duly executed by Tenant and such subtenant shall be delivered promptly to Landlord and Tenant shall remain liable for the payment of the Rent and for the performance and observance of all of the covenants and conditions to be performed by Tenant hereunder. The provisions of this Section 16.2 shall not be deemed a waiver of the provisions set forth in Section   16.1(a)  . No subtenant that is an Affiliate of Tenant shall be required to attorn to Landlord as set forth above in this Section 16.2. 
   
  16.3      Permitted Sublease and Assignment.    Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to the provisions of Section 16.4 and any other express conditions or limitations set forth herein, Tenant may, without Landlord s consent, sublease space at the Leased Property for any uses ancillary to the Permitted Use, so long as such subleases do not demise, in the aggregate, in excess of 3,000 square feet (exclusive of any parking garage subleases), and will not violate or affect any Legal Requirement or Insurance Requirement. 
   
  16.4      Sublease Limitation.    For so long as Landlord or any Affiliate of Landlord or any Member or beneficiary of Landlord or any direct or indirect constituent owner thereof shall seek to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Code, anything contained in this Lease to the contrary notwithstanding, Tenant shall not sublet the Leased Property on any basis such that the rental to be paid by any sublessee thereunder would be based, in whole or in part, on either (a) the income or profits derived by the business activities of such sublessee or (b) any other formula such that any portion of such sublease rental would fail to qualify as  rents from real property  within the meaning of Section 856(d) of the Code, or any similar or successor provision thereto. 
   
  Article 17      ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATES AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
   
  17.1      Estoppel Certificates.    At any time and from time to time, upon not less than 10 Business Days prior Notice by either party, the party receiving such Notice shall furnish to the other a certificate certifying that this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect (or that this Lease is in full force and effect as modified and setting forth the modifications), the date to which the Rent has been paid, that to its knowledge no Default or an Event of Default by the other party has occurred and is continuing or, if a Default or an Event of Default shall exist, specifying in reasonable detail the nature thereof, and the steps being taken to remedy the same, and such additional information as the requesting party may reasonably request. If such additional information reasonably requires more than 10 Business Days to provide, then the party furnishing such information shall be entitled to such additional period to respond to such request as may be reasonably required under the circumstances. Any such certificate furnished pursuant to this Section 17.1 may be relied upon by the requesting party, its lenders, and any prospective purchaser or mortgagee of the Leased Property or the leasehold estate created hereby. 
   
  17.2      Accounting and Annual Reconciliation.    (a)  Within 30 days after the close of each Accounting Period (or such earlier time period as required under the Management Agreement), Tenant shall cause Manager to deliver an interim accounting (the    Accounting Period Statement   ) to Landlord showing Gross Revenues, and applications and distributions thereof for the preceding Accounting Period. Tenant shall cause Manager to transfer to Tenant, with each Accounting Period Statement, any interim amounts due Tenant, subject to Working Capital needs, and shall retain any interim amounts due Manager. Calculations and payments of the Management Fees due Manager, and distributions to Tenant made with respect to each Accounting Period within a Fiscal Year shall be accounted for cumulatively. 
  (b)    Within 120 days after the end of each Fiscal Year (or such earlier time period as required under the Management Agreement), Tenant shall cause Manager to deliver to Tenant and Landlord a statement (the    Annual Operating Statement   ) in reasonable detail summarizing the operations of the Hotels for the immediately preceding Fiscal Year, audited and certified by a nationally recognized firm of certified public accountants having hotel accounting experience as described in the Management Agreement. The parties shall promptly after Landlord s receipt of such Annual Operating Statement, make any adjustments, by cash payment, in the amounts paid or retained for such Fiscal Year as are needed because of the final figures set forth in such Annual Operating Statement as reconciled by Manager and/or Tenant to the Accounting Period Statements. Such Annual Operating Statement shall be controlling over the preceding Accounting Period Statements. 
   
  17.3      Books and Records.    Books of control and account pertaining to operations at the Hotels shall be kept by Tenant, or by Manager on behalf of Tenant, on the accrual basis and in all material respects in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts and GAAP. Tenant, upon Landlord s reasonable request and at reasonable intervals during Manager s normal business hours, shall examine such records to seek to obtain such information therefrom as reasonably directed by Landlord. 
   
  17.4      Business Plan.    (a)  Tenant shall cause Manager to deliver to Landlord and Tenant for their review and approval, in accordance with the Management Agreement, a business plan showing the estimated Gross Revenues for the forthcoming Fiscal Year, in comparison to the forecasted Gross Revenues for the current Fiscal Year, each in a reasonably itemized and detailed, as well as summary, form. Such comparison shall include the estimated percentage changes in such items for the forthcoming Fiscal Year compared to the current Fiscal Year. Tenant shall also cause Manager to submit to Landlord for Landlord s approval the Capital Reserve Budget described in Section 5.2(b) and the Building Estimate described in Section 5.3 at the same time that it submits the business plan. Tenant shall cause Manager to prepare the business plan in accordance with the standards set forth in this Lease and the Management Agreement. Landlord shall have 5 Business Days after receipt of the business plan to review and approve such business plan, and, in the event that Landlord disapproves any category in the business plan, Landlord shall notify Tenant, and Tenant shall, in turn provide Manager in writing, with the specific reasons for Landlord s disapproval, by category, within such 5 Business Day period. The parties will attempt to resolve in good faith any such objections by Landlord within 5 Business Days following Manager s receipt of Tenant s notice of Landlord s disapproval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord shall not be entitled to withhold its approval with respect to costs that are system-wide for Manager s System, including, without limitation, any system-wide compensation or benefit programs; provided, that such programs are reasonably comparable to others in the hospitality industry. Pending such agreement, Tenant shall operate, or cause Manager to operate, the Hotels with respect to those categories that are in dispute based on the previous Fiscal Year s approved Business Plan, adjusted in accordance with changes in the GDP Deflator over the Fiscal Year just ended and anticipated changes in Gross Revenues. If Landlord fails to provide any objection within the initial 5 Business Day period set forth above, the business plan as submitted by Manager shall be deemed approved. If Landlord and Tenant cannot resolve in good faith any such objections by Landlord within the second 5 Business Day period set forth above, then Landlord s determination in respect of such objections shall control. The approved business plan for each Fiscal Year is herein referred to as the    Business Plan   . 
  (b)    Tenant shall cause Manager to diligently operate the Hotels in accordance with the Business Plan. 
  (c)    In addition to the information described in the first sentence of Section   17.4(a)  , upon Landlord s request, Tenant shall cause Manager to include (to the extent reasonably available to Manager) the following information along with each business plan submitted to Landlord pursuant to the provisions of  Section   17.4(a)  : (i) general information concerning pay scales and benefits programs applicable to employees of the Hotels, Manager s general staffing policies, and Manager s plans for staffing levels at the Hotels for the forthcoming Fiscal Year; (ii) Manager s marketing plan for the forthcoming Fiscal Year; (iii) estimates of furniture, fixtures, and equipment and Capital Expenditure requirements and expenditures for the forthcoming three Fiscal Years; and (iv) estimates of the Hotels  Working Capital and Fixed Asset Supply needs for the forthcoming Fiscal Year. 
   
  Article 18      LANDLORD S RIGHT TO INSPECT 
  The parties acknowledge that Landlord is a direct or indirect controlled subsidiary of an entity, Extended Stay America, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the    REOC Parent   ), that is intended to qualify as a  real estate operating company  (a    REOC   ) within the meaning of the U.S. Department of Labor plan assets regulation (Section 2510.3-101, Part 2510 of Chapter XXV, Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations) and that it is intended that Landlord will have the rights, pursuant to this Lease, as would be reasonably necessary to result in the qualification of REOC Parent as a REOC. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, notwithstanding any other provision of this Lease, without prejudice to the other rights provided to Landlord under this Lease, Tenant agrees to: (a) permit Landlord and REOC Parent to visit and inspect the Leased Property, to make such repairs as Landlord is permitted or required to make pursuant to the terms of this Lease, and inspect and copy the books and records of Tenant, at such times as Landlord shall reasonably request; provided, that any inspection or repair by Landlord and REOC Parent or their representatives will not unreasonably interfere with Tenant s or Manager s use and operation of the Leased Property; (b) periodically (at least quarterly) provide Landlord and REOC Parent with information and reports regarding Tenant s or Manager s operation and management of the Leased Property and the performance of its duties under this Lease and with respect to renovations, alterations, general maintenance, repairs, and development activities that Tenant has engaged in or intends to engage in with respect to the Leased Property and its surroundings; (c) periodically (at least quarterly) consult with Landlord and REOC Parent in advance with respect to any right retained under this Lease and with respect to Tenant s operation and management of the Leased Property, as appropriate, and the performance of Tenant s duties under this Lease including, without limitation, with respect to matters relating to renovations, alterations, general maintenance, repairs, and development activities with respect to the Leased Property and its surroundings; and (d) to provide Landlord and REOC Parent with such other rights as may reasonably be determined by Landlord to be necessary to enable REOC Parent to qualify as a REOC; provided, that such additional rights do not materially adversely affect (A) Tenant s ability to perform its duties under this Lease or the economic benefits enjoyed by Tenant under this Lease or (B) the status of ESH Hospitality as a real estate investment trust under the Code. Tenant agrees to consider, in good faith, the recommendations of Landlord in connection with the matters on which it is consulted as described above. 
   
  Article 19      GROUND LEASE 
   
  19.1      Ground Leases.    It is understood and agreed that Landlord holds a leasehold interest in the Land and Hotels located at the addresses listed on Exhibit E. 
   
  19.2      This Lease is, in Part, a Sublease.    The parties acknowledge that this Lease is a sublease with respect to the property demised under the Ground Lease which shall, at all times during the Term, be subject and subordinate to the Ground Lease and all matters to which the Ground Lease is subject and subordinate. Tenant hereby expressly assumes and agrees to comply with and be bound by, for the benefit of Landlord, all of the covenants, agreements, terms, and obligations of the Ground Lease, except as modified herein, and all such covenants, agreements, terms, and obligations of the Ground Lease are made a part of and incorporated into this Lease as if recited herein in full. Landlord and Tenant further agree not to take any action or perform any act or fail to perform any act which would result in the violation or breach of any of the covenants, agreements, terms, or obligations under the Ground Lease on the part of the Landlord as lessee thereunder. As between the parties hereto only, in the event of a conflict between the terms of the Ground Lease and the terms of this Lease, the terms of this Lease shall control. 
   
  Article 20      LIMITATIONS 
   
  20.1      REIT Compliance.    Landlord is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of ESH Hospitality. Tenant acknowledges that ESH Hospitality intends to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Code. Tenant agrees that it will not knowingly or intentionally take or omit to take any action, or permit any status or condition to exist at the Leased Property, which Tenant actually knows (acting in good faith) would or could result in (a) the Rent payable under this Lease not qualifying as  rents from real property  as defined in Section 856(d) of the Code or (b) ESH Hospitality being disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust under the Code as the provisions exist on the date hereof; provided, that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (A) Tenant shall not be responsible for any act or omission of Landlord or Manager (unless Manager s action was with the express written consent, or at the direction, of Tenant), and (B) any action by Tenant taken in compliance with the express terms of this Lease or the Management Agreement shall not be deemed to create a Default or Event of Default under this Section 20.1.  
   
  20.2      FF E Limitation.    This Section 20.2 is intended to insure that all of the rent payable under this Lease qualifies as  rents from real property  within the meaning of Section 856(d) of the Code or any similar or successor provisions thereto. In furtherance of such purpose, the parties have agreed to the terms set forth in Exhibit B. 
   
  20.3      Sublease Rent Limitation.    Anything contained in this Lease to the contrary notwithstanding, from and after the Commencement Date, Tenant shall not knowingly or intentionally (acting in good faith) enter into any sublease with respect to the Leased Property or any part thereof on any basis such that the rental to be paid by the sublessee thereunder would be based (or considered to be based), in whole or in part, on either (a) the income or profits derived by the business activities of the sublessee, or (b) any other formula such that any portion of the rent payable hereunder would or could, to Tenant s actual knowledge (acting in good faith), fail to qualify as  rents from real property  within the meaning of Section 856(d) of the Code, or any similar or successor provisions thereto. 
   
  Article 21      MISCELLANEOUS 
   
  21.1      No Waiver.    No failure by Landlord or Tenant to insist upon the strict performance of any term hereof or to exercise any right, power, or remedy consequent upon a breach thereof, and no acceptance of full or partial payment of Rent during the continuance of any such breach, shall constitute a waiver of any such breach or of any such term. To the maximum extent permitted by law, no waiver of any breach shall affect or alter this Lease, which shall continue in full force and effect with respect to any other then existing or subsequent breach. 
   
  21.2      Remedies Cumulative.    To the maximum extent permitted, by law, each legal, equitable, or contractual right, power, and remedy of Landlord or Tenant, now or hereafter provided either in this Lease or by statute or otherwise, shall be cumulative and concurrent and shall be in addition to every other right, power, and remedy and the exercise or beginning of the exercise by Landlord or Tenant (as applicable) of any one or more of such rights, powers, and remedies shall not preclude the simultaneous or subsequent exercise by Landlord of any or all of such other rights, powers, and remedies. 
   
  21.3      Severability.    Any clause, sentence, paragraph, section, or provision of this Lease held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or ineffective shall not impair, invalidate, or nullify the remainder of this Lease, but rather the effect thereof shall be confined to the clause, sentence, paragraph, section, or provision so held to be invalid, illegal, or ineffective, and this Lease shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal, or ineffective provisions had never been contained herein. 
   
  21.4      Acceptance of Surrender.    No surrender to Landlord of this Lease or of the Leased Property or any part thereof, or of any interest therein, shall be valid or effective unless agreed to and accepted in writing by Landlord and no act by Landlord or any representative or agent of Landlord, other than such a written acceptance by Landlord, shall constitute an acceptance of any such surrender. 
   
  21.5      No Merger of Title.    It is expressly acknowledged and agreed that it is the intent of the parties that there shall be no merger of this Lease or of the leasehold estate created hereby by reason of the fact that the same Person may acquire, own, or hold, directly or indirectly, this Lease or the leasehold estate created hereby and the fee estate or ground landlord s interest in the Leased Property. 
   
  21.6      Conveyance by Landlord.    If Landlord or any successor owner of all or any portion of the Leased Property shall convey all or any portion of the Leased Property in accordance with the terms of this Lease other than as security for a debt, and the grantee or transferee of such of the Leased Property shall expressly assume all obligations of Landlord hereunder with respect to such of the Leased Property arising or accruing from and after the date of such conveyance or transfer, then Landlord or such successor owner, as the case may be, shall thereupon be released from all future liabilities and obligations of Landlord under this Lease with respect to such of the Leased Property arising or accruing from and after the date of such conveyance or other transfer and all such future liabilities and obligations shall thereupon be binding upon the new owner. 
   
  21.7      Quiet Enjoyment.    Provided that no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Tenant shall peaceably and quietly have, hold, and enjoy the Leased Property for the Term, free of hindrance or molestation by Landlord or anyone claiming by, through, or under Landlord, but subject to (a) any encumbrance permitted to be created by Landlord hereunder, (b) liens as to obligations of Landlord that are either not yet due or which are being contested in good faith and by proper proceedings; provided, that the same do not materially interfere with Tenant s or Manager s ability to operate the Hotels, and (c) liens that have been consented to in writing by Tenant. Except as otherwise provided in this Lease, no failure by Landlord to comply with the foregoing covenant shall give Tenant the right to cancel or terminate this Lease or abate, reduce, or make a deduction from or offset against the Rent or any other sum payable under this Lease ,or to fail to perform any other obligation of Tenant hereunder. 
   
  21.8      Memorandum of Lease.    Neither Landlord nor Tenant shall record this Lease. However, Landlord and Tenant shall promptly, upon the request of the other, enter into a short form memorandum of this Lease, in form suitable for recording under the laws of the states in which the Hotels are located in which reference to this Lease, and all options contained herein, shall be made. The parties shall share equally all costs and expenses of recording such memorandum. 
   
  21.9      True Lease.    The parties hereto intend that this Lease shall be treated as a true lease for federal tax purposes. 
   
  21.10      Notices.    (a)  Any and all notices, demands, consents, approvals, offers, elections, and other communications required or permitted under this Lease shall be deemed adequately given if in writing and the same shall be delivered either in hand, or by mail, or Federal Express or similar expedited commercial carrier, addressed to the recipient of the notice, postpaid, and registered or certified with return receipt requested (if by mail), or with all freight charges prepaid (if by Federal Express or similar carrier). 
  (b)    All notices required or permitted to be sent hereunder shall be deemed to have been given for all purposes of this Lease upon the date of receipt or refusal, except that whenever under this Lease a notice is either received on a day which is not a Business Day or is required to be delivered on or before a specific day which is not a Business Day, the day of receipt or required delivery shall automatically be extended to the next Business Day.

In the event of any dispute between the parties concerning this Lease, Landlord shall be entitled to an award of attorney s fees and costs in connection with such dispute, including, without limitation, in connection with any suit, action, arbitration, or other proceeding concerning such dispute. Except as otherwise set forth in this Lease, any obligations arising prior to the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease of Tenant (including, without limitation, any monetary, repair, and indemnification obligations) and Landlord shall survive the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease; provided, that each party shall be required to give the other Notice of any such surviving and unsatisfied obligations within one year after the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease. Nothing contained in this Lease shall be construed to create or impose any liabilities or obligations and no such liabilities or obligations shall be imposed on any of the shareholders, beneficial owners, direct or indirect, officers, directors, trustees, employees, or agents of Landlord or Tenant for the payment or performance of the obligations or liabilities of Landlord or Tenant hereunder. Further, in the event Landlord shall be in default under this Lease, and if as a consequence of such default, Tenant shall recover a money judgment against Landlord, then such judgment shall be satisfied only out of the proceeds of sale received upon execution of such judgment against the right, title, and interest of Landlord in the Leased Property. 
   
  21.12      Counterparts; Headings.    This Lease may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but which, when taken together, shall constitute but one instrument and shall become effective as of the date hereof when copies hereof, which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the parties hereto shall have been signed. Headings in this Lease are for purposes of reference only and shall not limit or affect the meaning of the provisions hereof. 
   
  21.13      Applicable Law.    This Lease shall be interpreted, construed, applied, and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York; provided, that the provisions for the enforcement of Landlord s rights and remedies hereunder shall be governed by the laws of each of the respective states where the Leased Property is located to the extent necessary for the validity and enforcement thereof. 
   
  21.14      Right to Make Agreement.    Each party warrants, with respect to itself, that neither the execution of this Lease, nor the consummation of any transaction contemplated hereby, shall violate any provision of any law, or any judgment, writ, injunction, order, or decree of any court or governmental authority having jurisdiction over it; nor result in or constitute a breach or default under any indenture, contract, or other commitment or restriction to which it is a party or by which it is bound; nor require any consent, vote, or approval which has not been given or taken, or at the time of the transaction involved shall not have been given or taken. Each party covenants that it has and will continue to have, throughout the term of this Lease and any extensions thereof, the full right to enter into this Lease and perform its obligations hereunder. 
   
  21.15      Disclosure of Information.    (a)  The parties hereto agree that the matters set forth in this Lease and any revenue, expense, net profit, room rate, and occupancy information provided on a Hotel by Hotel basis are strictly confidential and each party will make every effort to ensure that the information is not disclosed to any Person that is not an Affiliate of any party (including the press) without the prior written consent of the other party, except as may be required by law and as may be reasonably necessary to obtain licenses, permits, and other public approvals necessary for the refurbishment or operation of the Hotels, or, in connection with a Landlord financing, a sale of a Hotel, or a sale of a Controlling Interest in Landlord or Tenant. 
  (b)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing provisions of this Section 21.15 or elsewhere in this Lease, any party (and any employee, representative, or other agent of any party) may disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated by this Lease and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to any party relating to such tax treatment and tax structure; provided, that any such information and materials shall be kept confidential to the extent necessary to comply with any applicable securities laws. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated by this Lease shall not be deemed to include the identity of the parties, the location of the Leased Property, or the amount of Rent payable by Tenant hereunder. The foregoing authorization of disclosure is retroactively effective immediately upon commencement of the first discussions among the parties regarding the transactions contemplated hereby, and the parties aver and affirm that this tax disclosure authorization has been given on a date which is no later than 30 days from the first day that any party (or any employee, representative, or other agent of a party) first made or provided a statement as to the potential federal income tax consequences that may result from the transactions contemplated hereby. 
  (c)    The obligations of Tenant and Landlord contained in this Section 21.15 shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease. 
   
  21.16      Operating Lease.    The parties hereto intend that this Lease shall be deemed for all purposes to be an operating lease and not a capital lease. 
   
  21.17      No Joint Venture or Partnership.    Landlord and Tenant intend that the relationship created hereunder be solely that of landlord and tenant. Nothing herein is intended to create a joint venture, partnership, tenancy-in-common, or joint tenancy relationship between Landlord and Tenant. 
   
  21.18      Landlord Obligations.    Each Entity comprising  Landlord  shall be responsible for complying with their respective obligations under this Lease, as such obligations relate to the applicable Leased Property owned by such Entity.

The parties agree that (i) the terms and conditions of the Original Lease Agreement shall be amended as set forth herein and, as so amended, shall be restated in their entirety, but shall be amended only with respect to the rights, title, estates, interest, liabilities, duties, covenants, obligations and agreements among the parties accruing from and after the date hereof.

EXHIBIT B 
  PROVISIONS RELATING TO EXCESS FF E 
  1.    This Exhibit B is intended to insure that all of the rent payable under this Lease qualifies as  rents from real property  within the meaning of Section 856(d) of the Code or any similar or successor provisions thereto. In furtherance of such purpose, the parties have agreed to the terms set forth in the following paragraphs of this Exhibit B with the objective that, anything contained in this Lease to the contrary notwithstanding, the average of the fair market value of the items of  personal property  (within the meaning of Section 856(d)(1)(C) of the Code) that are leased to Tenant under a lease at the beginning and at the end of any Fiscal Year shall not exceed 14% of the average of the aggregate fair market value of the Leased Property under such lease at the beginning and at the end of each such Fiscal Year as determined by the Landlord pursuant to Section 856(d)(1)(c) (the    FF E Limitation   ). The provisions contained in the following paragraphs shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the intent and objective described above (it being understood that this paragraph constitutes a statement of the parties  mutual intent only and that the failure to achieve such objective, absent any Default or Event of Default under the other paragraphs of this Exhibit B or any other provisions of this Lease, shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default hereunder). 
  2.    If Landlord reasonably anticipates and gives Notice (an    Excess FF E Notice   ) and reasonably satisfactory evidence to Tenant that the FF E Limitation might be exceeded with respect to any Leased Property for any Fiscal Year, then Tenant shall, in accordance with the provisions set forth below and within 60 days following the delivery of such Excess FF E Notice, purchase from Landlord, or Landlord shall contribute to the capital of Tenant, those items or categories of FF E to be acquired by Landlord during such Fiscal Year which are designated in such Excess FF E Notice as anticipated to cause Landlord to exceed the FF E Limitation (   Excess FF E   ). If Tenant shall purchase such Excess FF E from Landlord, then the price shall be equal to the Excess FF E FMV. 
  3.    With respect to any Excess FF E first received or purchased by Tenant pursuant to the terms of this Exhibit B during a particular Fiscal Year, Tenant s annual Rent obligations shall be reduced, because such Excess FF E is no longer leased by Tenant, in the following manner (the    FF E Adjustment   ):  
  (a)    For the Fiscal Year in which such Excess FF E is first placed in service by Tenant, such reduction shall be in an amount (the    First Year FF E Adjustment   ) equal to the mathematical product of (i) the Market Leasing Factor for personal property with an average expected useful life corresponding to the weighted average expected useful life (as determined in accordance with GAAP and rounded to the nearest whole year) of all Excess FF E first placed in service by Tenant during such Fiscal Year (such weighted average, the    Applicable Expected Life   ) times (ii) the Excess FF E Value of all Excess FF E first placed in service by Tenant during such Fiscal Year times (iii) 110% times (iv) 50%; 
  (b)    For each subsequent Fiscal Year prior to the Fiscal Year in which the Applicable Expected Life for such Excess FF E expires, such reduction shall be in an amount equal to twice the First Year FF E Adjustment; and 
  (c)    For the Fiscal Year in which the Applicable Expected Life for such Excess FF E expires, such reduction shall be in an amount equal to the First Year FF E Adjustment. 
  It is contemplated that there would be a separate FF E Adjustment for all Excess FF E first placed in service during a single Fiscal Year (with such FF E Adjustment extending for a period equal to the lesser of the remaining Term or the Applicable Expected Life of the Excess FF E acquired during such Fiscal Year). The Rent payable by Tenant for each Accounting Period in a Fiscal Year to which one or more FF E Adjustments apply shall be reduced by an amount equal to the mathematical product of (A) the amount of such applicable FF E Adjustment (or if more than one FF E Adjustment apply in such Fiscal Year, the sum of such applicable FF E Adjustments) times (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the number of Accounting Periods in such Fiscal Year. The    Excess FF E Value    of any Excess FF E shall be the fair market value of such Excess FF E (   Excess FF E FMV   ) plus the aggregate amount of out-of-pocket transactional costs (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys  fees and any   ad valorem  , sales, transfer, transaction, or similar tax, levy, or other governmental charge) incurred by such purchaser in connection with its purchase of such Excess FF E. The    Market Leasing Factor    (with there to be a separate Market Leasing Factor for each whole number of years of expected useful life of Excess FF E) shall be determined by an independent valuation expert, acceptable to both Landlord and Tenant, who shall determine the Market Leasing Factors based on the median of the leasing rates of at least three nationally recognized companies engaged in the business of leasing similar FF E or personal property and equipment. The cost of such expert shall be borne by Landlord. 
  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this paragraph 3, Tenant s annual Rent as reduced by operation of this paragraph shall not be less than the Minimum Rent provided for in Article 3 of this Lease. 
  4.    In the event that Tenant owns any Excess FF E at the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease (including, without limitation, a termination in connection with a transfer of ownership of the Leased Property), Landlord shall purchase from Tenant and Tenant shall sell to Landlord, on the effective date of such expiration or termination, all such Excess FF E for a purchase price equal to the fair market value (which the parties hereby agree shall not be less than the adjusted book value) of such Excess FF E at such time. 

EXHIBIT C 
    
  PROVISIONS RELATING TO PERCENTAGE RENT 

Percentage Rent for any Fiscal Year shall equal the sum of: 
    
  (a)    the product of (i) all Gross Revenues for such Fiscal Year in excess of the Tier 1 Threshold but less than or equal to the Tier 2 Threshold and (ii) the Tier 1 Percentage; plus 
    
  (b)    the product of (i) all Gross Revenues for such Fiscal Year in excess of the Tier 2 Threshold but less than or equal to the Tier 3 Threshold and (ii) the Tier 2 Percentage; plus 
    
  (c)    the product of (i) all Gross Revenues for such Fiscal Year in excess of the Tier 3 Threshold and (ii) the Tier 3 Percentage. 
    
     Tier 1 Percentage    means fifty-four percent (54%). 
    
     Tier 1 Threshold    means $869,000,000.00, increasing at a rate of three percent (3%) per annum compounded annually for each Fiscal Year. 
    
     Tier 2 Percentage    means sixty-five percent (65%). 
    
     Tier 2 Threshold    means $996,000,000.00, increasing at a rate of three percent (3%) per annum compounded annually for each Fiscal Year. 
    
     Tier 3 Percentage    means seventy-six and one half percent (76.5%). 
    
     Tier 3 Threshold    means $1,152,000,000.00, increasing at a rate of three percent (3%) per annum compounded annually for each Fiscal Year. 
    
     Thresholds    means each of the Tier 1 Threshold, the Tier 2 Threshold, and the Tier 3 Threshold.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no expenditures shall be made in excess of the amounts set forth in the then-applicable Capital Reserve Budget without the approval of Landlord; provided, that Tenant or the Management Parties shall be authorized to take appropriate remedial action (including, without limitation, making any necessary expenditures above the total aggregate amount set forth in the then-applicable Capital Reserve Budget), without receiving Landlord s prior approval, to remedy or respond to any of the Emergency Requirements (provided further that Tenant shall notify Landlord of any such remedial action that requires more than a   de minimis   expenditure of funds).

  (b)    Notwithstanding the provisions of  Section 5.3(a), Tenant shall be authorized to take appropriate remedial action (including, without limitation, making any necessary Capital Expenditures) without receiving Landlord s prior approval, to remedy or respond to any of the Emergency Requirements; provided that Tenant shall notify Landlord of any such remedial action that requires a Capital Expenditure that is not   de minimis  . Tenant and the Management Parties shall cooperate with Landlord in the pursuit of any such action and shall have the right to participate therein. Landlord shall, upon written request by Tenant, or the Management Parties on behalf of Tenant, promptly reimburse all expenditures made by Tenant or the Management Parties pursuant to this Section 5.3(b). 
  (c)    The cost of all Capital Expenditures (including, without limitation, the expenses incurred by Landlord or Tenant or the Management Parties in connection with any civil or criminal proceeding arising by reason of an Emergency Requirement) shall be borne solely by Landlord, and shall not be paid from Gross Revenues. 
  5.4      Ownership of Replacements.    All Capital Expenditures and, subject to the rights of the Management Parties under the Management Agreement, all repairs, alterations, improvements, renewals, and replacements made pursuant to this Article 5, other than FF E, shall be the property of Landlord.

  5.7      Management Agreement.    Except as otherwise provided below, Tenant shall not amend or modify the Management Agreement or replace the Management Parties without Landlord s prior written consent, which consent may be given or withheld by Landlord in its sole and absolute discretion. The terms of the Management Agreement (a) shall not, in Landlord s and its counsel s reasonable opinion, cause the Rent to fail to qualify as  rents from real property  within the meaning of Section 856(d) of the Code, and (b) shall expressly provide that if Landlord and its counsel reasonably conclude that the terms of the Management Agreement will have such an effect, then the terms of the Management Agreement will be modified so that the Management Agreement, in the reasonable opinion of Landlord and its counsel, does not cause the Rent to be so characterized under the Code; provided, that no such modifications shall affect the amount of the Management Fees (as defined in the Management Agreement) or the practical realization of the rights and benefits of the Management Parties thereunder. 
  5.8      Trademark License Agreements.    (a) Tenant shall not operate, or permit the Management Parties to operate, any Hotel under a trade name other than the trade names licensed to Tenant under the Trademark License Agreements, without the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent may be given or withheld by Landlord in its sole and absolute discretion.

It is the intent of the parties hereto that, except as otherwise specifically provided by this Lease, Tenant shall comply in every respect with the provisions of any Trademark License Agreement to which Tenant is a party so as to avoid any default thereunder during the term of this Lease. Landlord and Tenant agree to cooperate fully with each other in the event it becomes necessary to obtain a trademark license extension or modification or a new trademark license for the Leased Property; provided, that Landlord shall pay the entire cost of any upgrades required by any licensor. 
  ARTICLE 6.      IMPROVEMENTS, ETC. 
  Tenant shall not finance the cost of any construction by the granting of a lien on, or security interest in, the Leased Property, or Tenant s interest therein, without the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent may be withheld by Landlord in Landlord s sole discretion. Any such improvements shall, upon the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease, remain or pass to and become the property of Landlord, free and clear of any encumbrance permitted to be created by Landlord. 
  ARTICLE 7.      LIENS 
  Subject to Article 8, Tenant shall not, and Tenant shall ensure that the Management Parties do not, directly or indirectly, create or allow to remain, and each shall promptly discharge, at its expense, any lien, encumbrance, attachment, title retention agreement, or claim upon the Leased Property or Tenant s leasehold interest therein or any attachment, levy, claim, or encumbrance in respect of the Rent, other than (a) restrictions, liens, and other encumbrances which are consented to in writing by Landlord, (b) liens for those taxes of Landlord which Tenant is not required to pay hereunder, (c) subleases permitted by Article 16, (d) liens for Impositions or for sums resulting from noncompliance with Legal Requirements so long as (i) the same are not yet due and payable, or (ii) are being contested in accordance with Article 8, (e) liens of mechanics, laborers, materialmen, suppliers, or vendors incurred in the ordinary course of business that are not yet due and payable (but will be paid in full by Tenant or the Management Parties) or are for sums that are being contested in accordance with Article 8, (f) any Mortgage or other liens which are the responsibility of Landlord, and (g) Landlord Liens. 
  ARTICLE 8.      PERMITTED CONTESTS 
  Tenant, or the Management Parties at Tenant s direction, shall have the right to contest the amount or validity of any Imposition, Legal Requirement, Insurance Requirement, lien, attachment, levy, encumbrance, charge, or claim (collectively,    Claims   ) as to the Leased Property, by appropriate legal proceedings, conducted in good faith and with due diligence; provided, that (a) the foregoing shall in no way be construed as relieving, modifying, or extending Tenant s obligation to pay any Claims required hereunder to be paid by Tenant as finally determined, (b) such contest shall not cause Landlord or Tenant to be in default under any mortgage, deed of trust, or other agreement encumbering the Leased Property or any part thereof (Landlord agreeing that any such mortgage, deed of trust, or other agreement shall permit Tenant to exercise the rights granted pursuant to this Article 8) or any interest therein or result in a lien attaching to the Leased Property, unless such lien is fully bonded or is otherwise secured to the reasonable satisfaction of Landlord, (c) no part of the Leased Property nor any Rent therefrom shall be in any immediate danger of sale, forfeiture, attachment, or loss, and (d) Tenant hereby indemnifies and holds harmless Landlord from and against any cost, claim, damage, penalty, or reasonable expense, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys  fees, incurred by Landlord in connection therewith or as a result thereof. Landlord agrees to join in any such proceedings if required legally to prosecute such contest; provided, that Landlord shall not thereby be subjected to any liability therefor (including, without limitation, for the payment of any costs or expenses in connection therewith) unless Tenant agrees to assume and indemnify Landlord with respect to the same. Tenant or the Management Parties, as applicable, shall be entitled to any refund of any Claims and such charges and penalties or interest thereon which have been paid by Tenant or paid by Landlord to the extent that Landlord has been reimbursed by Tenant. If Tenant shall fail to pay or cause to be paid any Claims when finally determined, to provide reasonable security therefor, or to prosecute or cause to be prosecuted any such contest diligently and in good faith, then Landlord may, upon Notice to Tenant, pay such charges, together with interest and penalties due with respect thereto, and Tenant shall reimburse Landlord therefor, upon demand, as Additional Charges. 
  ARTICLE 9.      INSURANCE 
  9.1      General Insurance Requirements.    (a)   Coverages by Landlord  .  During the Term, Landlord shall at its expense, without reimbursement from Tenant, at all times keep the Leased Property insured (except to the extent such insurance is required to be kept by Tenant pursuant to Section 9.1(b)). 
  (b)      Coverages by Tenant.    During the Term, Tenant shall at its expense keep the insurance described in Sections 9.1(b)(i) through (v). This insurance shall be written by companies authorized to issue insurance in the jurisdiction where the Leased Property is located and otherwise acceptable to Landlord. If required by Landlord, the policies must name Landlord as an additional named insured.

  9.2      Waiver of Subrogation.    All insurance policies carried by Landlord or Tenant covering the Leased Property, the FF E, the Hotels, or Tenant s Personal Property, including, without limitation, contents, fire, and casualty insurance, shall expressly waive any right of subrogation on the part of the insurer against the other party. Landlord and Tenant agree that their policies will include such waiver clause or endorsement so long as the same are obtainable without extra cost, and in the event of such an extra cost the other party, at its election, may pay the same, but shall not be obligated to do so. Each party agrees to seek recovery from any applicable insurance coverage prior to seeking recovery against the other. 
  9.3      Form Satisfactory, Etc.    All of the policies of insurance referred to in this Article 9 shall be written in a form, with deductibles and by insurance companies reasonably satisfactory to Landlord and also shall meet and satisfy the requirements of any ground lessor, lender, or franchisor having any interest in the Leased Property. Tenant shall deliver to Landlord policies or certificates of the insurance required under Section 9.1(b) as of their effective date (and, with respect to any renewal policy, upon or prior to the expiration of the existing policy), and in the event of the failure of Tenant either to obtain such insurance as herein called for or to pay the premiums therefor, or to deliver such policies or certificates thereof to Landlord at the times required, Landlord shall be entitled, but shall have no obligation, to obtain such insurance and pay the premiums therefor, and Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for any premium or premiums paid by Landlord for the coverages required under Section 9.1(b) upon written demand therefor, and repay the same within 30 days after Notice of such failure from Landlord shall constitute an Event of Default. Each insurer mentioned in this Article 9 shall agree, by endorsement to the policy or policies issued by it, or by independent instrument furnished to Landlord, to provide 30 days  written notice to Landlord before the policy or policies in question shall be materially altered, allowed to expire, or canceled. 
  9.4      Blanket Policy.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article 9, Tenant or Landlord may bring the insurance provided for herein within the coverage of a so-called blanket policy or policies of insurance carried and maintained by Tenant or Landlord; provided, that the coverage afforded to Landlord and Tenant will not be reduced or diminished or otherwise be different from that which would exist under a separate policy meeting all other requirements of this Lease by reason of the use of such blanket policy of insurance; and provided further, that the requirements of this Article 9 are otherwise satisfied. 
  9.5      Separate Insurance.    Tenant shall not on Tenant s own or pursuant to the request or requirement of any third party, take out separate insurance concurrent in form or contributing in the event of loss with that required in this Article 9 to be furnished, or increase the amount of any then existing insurance by securing an additional policy or additional policies, unless all parties having an insurable interest in the subject matter of the insurance, including, without limitation, and in all cases, Landlord, are each included therein as an additional insured, and the loss is payable under such additional separate insurance in the same manner as losses are payable under this Lease. Tenant shall immediately provide Notice to Landlord that Tenant has obtained any such separate insurance or of the increasing of any of the amounts of the then existing insurance.

Tenant shall promptly investigate and make a complete and timely written report to the appropriate insurance company as to all accidents, claims for damage relating to the ownership, operation, and maintenance of any Hotel, any damage or destruction to any Hotel, and the estimated cost of repair thereof, and shall prepare any and all reports required by any insurance company in connection therewith. All such reports shall be timely filed with the insurance company as required under the terms of the insurance policy involved, and a final copy of such report shall be furnished to Landlord. 
  9.7      Indemnification of Landlord.    Except as expressly provided herein, Tenant shall protect, indemnify, and hold harmless Landlord for, from, and against all liabilities, obligations, claims, damages, penalties, causes of action, costs, and reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys  fees), to the maximum extent permitted by law, imposed upon or incurred by or asserted against Landlord by reason of: (a) any accident, injury to, or death of persons, or loss of or damage to property of third parties, occurring during the Term on or about the Leased Property or adjoining sidewalks or rights of way under Tenant s control, and (b) any use, misuse, condition, management, maintenance, or repair by Tenant or anyone claiming under Tenant of the Leased Property or Tenant s Personal Property during the Term, or any litigation, proceeding, or claim by governmental entities to which Landlord is made a party or participant relating to such use, misuse, condition, management, maintenance, or repair; provided, that Tenant s obligations hereunder shall not apply to any liability, obligation, claim, damage, penalty, cause of action, cost, or expense arising from any gross negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord, its employees, agents, contractors, or invitees. Tenant, at its expense, shall defend any such claim, action, or proceeding asserted or instituted against Landlord covered under this indemnity (and shall not be responsible for any duplicative attorneys  fees incurred by Landlord) or may compromise or otherwise dispose of the same. The obligations of Tenant under this Section 9.7 shall survive the termination of this Lease for a period of one year. 
  ARTICLE 10.      DAMAGE, REPAIR, AND CONDEMNATION 
  10.1      Damage and Repair.    (a) If, during the Term, a Hotel is damaged by a Minor Casualty, then Tenant shall proceed, or cause the Management Parties to proceed, with all reasonable diligence, to process the claim with the applicable insurance carriers, including, without limitation, settling such claim, and to make the necessary arrangements with appropriate contractors and suppliers to repair and/or replace the damaged portion of such Hotel. Landlord s consent shall not be needed for Tenant or the Management Parties to perform any of the foregoing, all of which shall be performed in accordance with Tenant s reasonable judgment; provided, that all such work shall be undertaken (i) in a workmanlike manner, (ii) in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.3, and (iii) in accordance with plans and specifications approved by Landlord (which approval or disapproval shall be made within 10 Business Days after Landlord receives the applicable plans or specifications and, if applicable, within 10 Business Days after Landlord receives any modifications of said plans or specifications to accommodate Landlord s comments); provided, that the parties agree that the standard for such repair and/or replacement shall be to repair and/or replace the damaged portion of such Hotel to levels of quality and quantity that are equal to those that existed with respect to such portion of such Hotel prior to the occurrence of the damage at issue. Landlord agrees to sign promptly any documents which are necessary to process and/or adjust the claim with the insurance carriers, as well as any contracts with such contractors and/or suppliers. 
  (b)    If, during the Term, a Hotel suffers a Total Casualty, then Landlord shall, at its cost and expense and with all reasonable diligence, repair and/or replace the damaged portion of such Hotel to the same condition as existed previously. Such damage or destruction shall not terminate this Lease. Notwithstanding any provisions of this Article 10 to the contrary, if a Hotel suffers a Total Casualty during the last 24 months of the Term, then either of Landlord and Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease with respect to such Hotel by giving Notice to the other within 30 days after the date of damage or destruction, whereupon all accrued Rent with respect to such Hotel shall be paid immediately, this Lease shall automatically terminate with respect to such Hotel five (5) days after the date of such Notice and, upon such termination, Minimum Rent payable hereunder shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Minimum Rent allocated to the applicable Hotel set forth in Exhibit A and the Thresholds shall be reduced by the applicable Threshold Allocation.    Threshold Allocation    means (only for purposes of this Article 10), with respect to any applicable Hotel and as applied to the Thresholds, an amount calculated by multiplying the Thresholds by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Minimum Rent allocated to the applicable Hotel as set forth in Exhibit A, and the denominator of which is the aggregate Minimum Rent for all of the Hotels as set forth in Exhibit A. 
  (c)    If, during the Term, a Hotel is damaged by fire, casualty, or other cause to a greater extent than a Minor Casualty, but not to the extent of a Total Casualty, then Landlord shall, at its cost and expense and with all reasonable diligence, repair and/or replace the damaged portion of such Hotel to the same condition as existed previously. Tenant shall have the right to discontinue operating, or cause the Management Parties to discontinue operating, the Hotel to the extent Tenant deems necessary to comply with applicable Legal Requirements or as necessary for the safe and orderly operation of such Hotel. To the extent available, proceeds from the insurance described in Section 9.1 of this Lease shall be applied to such repairs and/or replacements. The parties agree that Landlord s obligations to repair and/or replace pursuant to the provisions of this Section 10.1(c) shall be limited to the extent of available insurance proceeds (plus the amount of any applicable deductibles). The parties further agree that if Landlord is obligated to utilize such available insurance proceeds to repay any obligations pursuant to any Mortgage, then Landlord shall be entitled to an equitable extension of time (in which Landlord has to fulfill its obligations pursuant to the provisions of this Section 10.1(c)) that is sufficient to allow Landlord to obtain the necessary funding to replace such spent insurance proceeds and to make the repairs and/or replacements required hereunder. The parties further agree that Landlord s obligations to repair and/or replace pursuant to the provisions of this Section 10.1(c) shall be subject to Landlord s ability to obtain such entitlements and/or other governmental approvals as may be necessary to undertake such repair and/or replacement; provided, that Landlord shall undertake good faith efforts to obtain such entitlements and/or approvals. 
  (d)    All insurance proceeds payable by reason of any loss of or damage to any of Tenant s Personal Property shall be paid to Tenant, and, to the extent necessary to repair or replace Tenant s Personal Property in accordance with this Section 10.1(d), Tenant shall hold such proceeds to pay the cost of repairing or replacing damaged Tenant s Personal Property and, if this Lease terminates, pay the same over to Landlord. If Landlord undertakes to restore the Leased Property as hereinabove provided, then Tenant shall either (i) restore all of Tenant s Personal Property, if any, or (ii) replace Tenant s Personal Property, if any, with items of the same or better quality and utility to the operation of the Leased Property. 
  10.2      Condemnation.    (a) In the event all or substantially all of a Hotel shall be taken in any eminent domain, condemnation, compulsory acquisition, or similar proceeding by any competent authority for any public or quasi-public use or purpose, or in the event a portion of a Hotel shall be so taken, but the result is that it is unreasonable to continue to operate such Hotel in accordance with the standards required by this Lease, this Lease shall terminate with respect to such Hotel as of the date of the taking and, upon such termination, Minimum Rent payable hereunder shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Minimum Rent allocated to the applicable Hotel set forth in Exhibit A and the Thresholds shall be reduced by the applicable Threshold Allocation. Landlord and Tenant shall each have the right to initiate such proceedings as they deem advisable to recover any compensation to which they may be entitled. 
  (b)    In the event a portion of a Hotel shall be taken by the events described in Section 10.2(a), or an entire Hotel is affected but on a temporary basis, and the result is not to make it unreasonable to continue to operate such Hotel, this Lease shall not terminate, but the Rent due hereunder shall be equitably abated taking into consideration, among other relevant factors, the number of useable rooms, the amount of square footage, or revenues affected or taken by such events. However, so much of any Award for any such partial taking or condemnation as shall be necessary to render the Hotel equivalent to its condition prior to such event shall be used for such purpose and Tenant shall have the right to discontinue operating, or to cause the Management Parties to discontinue operating, the Hotel or portion of the Hotel to the extent it deems necessary for the safe and orderly operation of the Hotel. 
  ARTICLE 11.      CC Rs, LIENS, ETC. 
  11.1      No Covenants, Conditions, or Restrictions.    (a) Landlord covenants that after the Commencement Date and during the Term, there will not be (unless Tenant has given its prior consent thereto) any covenants, conditions, or restrictions, including, without limitation, reciprocal easement agreements or cost-sharing arrangements (individually or collectively referred to as    CC R(s)   ) affecting the Leased Property (i) which would prohibit the Management Parties  operation of the Hotels in accordance with the terms of this Lease and the Management Agreement, including, without limitation, related amenities proposed for the Hotels; (ii) which would allow the Hotels  facilities (for example, parking spaces) to be used by persons other than guests, invitees, or employees of the Hotels except as approved by Tenant; (iii) which would allow the Hotels  facilities to be used for specified charges or rates which have not been approved by the Management Parties; or (iv) which would subject the Hotels to exclusive arrangements regarding food and beverage operation or retail merchandise. 
  (b)    Tenant shall cause the Management Parties to manage and operate the Hotels in compliance with all obligations imposed on Landlord or the Hotels pursuant to any CC Rs to the extent (i) such obligations are known to the Management Parties (ii) such CC Rs relate to the management and operation of the Hotels and (iii) the CC Rs are not inconsistent with the Management Agreement. 
  11.2      Liens; Credit.    Tenant shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent any liens from being filed against the Hotels which arise from any maintenance, repairs, alterations, improvements, renewals, or replacements in or to the Hotels, and shall cooperate fully in obtaining the release of any such liens. 
  11.3      Amendments Requested by Mortgagee.    If requested by any Mortgagee or prospective Mortgagee, Tenant agrees to execute and deliver any amendment of this Lease that is reasonably required by such Mortgagee or prospective Mortgagee; provided, that Tenant shall be under no obligation to amend this Lease if the result of such amendment would be to materially and adversely increase Tenant s obligations or to materially and adversely affect Tenant s rights under this Lease or to amend Article 5. Any such amendment shall be in effect only for the period of time in which such Mortgage is outstanding. 
  ARTICLE 12.      DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES 
  12.1      Events of Default.    The occurrence of any one or more of the following events shall constitute an    Event of Default    hereunder:

  (b)    should Tenant fail to maintain the insurance coverages required under Article 9 and such failure shall continue for 10 Business Days after Notice thereof; 
  (c)    subject to Article 8 relating to permitted contests, should Tenant default in the due observance or performance of any of the terms, covenants, or agreements contained herein to be performed or observed by it (other than as specified in clauses (a) and (b) above) and such default shall continue for a period of 30 days after Notice thereof from Landlord to Tenant; provided, that if such default is susceptible of cure but such cure cannot be accomplished with due diligence within such period of time, and if, in addition, Tenant commences to cure or cause to be cured such default within 30 days after Notice thereof from Landlord and thereafter prosecutes the curing of such default with all due diligence, then such period of time shall be extended to such period of time (not to exceed 90 days) as may be necessary to cure such default with all due diligence; 
  (d)    should Tenant generally not be paying its debts as they become due or should Tenant make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; 
  (e)    should any petition be filed by or against Tenant under the relevant bankruptcy laws, or should any other proceeding be instituted by or against Tenant seeking to adjudicate it a bankrupt or insolvent, or seeking liquidation, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, or composition of it or its debts under any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization or relief of debtors, or seeking the entry of an order for relief or the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, or other similar official for Tenant or for any substantial part of the property of Tenant and such proceeding is not dismissed within 60 days after institution thereof, or should Tenant take any action to authorize any of the actions set forth above in this paragraph; 
  (f)    should Tenant cause or institute any proceeding for its dissolution or termination; 
  (g)    unless Tenant shall be contesting such lien or attachment in good faith in accordance with Article 8, should the estate or interest of Tenant in the Leased Property or any part thereof be levied upon or attached in any proceeding and the same shall not be vacated, discharged, or fully bonded or otherwise secured to the reasonable satisfaction of Landlord within the later of (i) 60 days after such attachment or levy, unless the amount in dispute is less than C$100,000.00 (as adjusted each year by increases or decreases in the Index), in which case Tenant shall give notice to Landlord of the dispute but Tenant may defend in any suitable way, and (ii) 30 days after receipt by Tenant of Notice thereof from Landlord; it being understood and agreed that Tenant may commence a contest of such matter pursuant to Article 8 above following such Notice from Landlord; or 
  (h)    should Tenant be in default under the Management Agreement beyond any applicable cure period, 
  then, and in any such event, Landlord, in addition to all other remedies available to it, may terminate this Lease by giving Notice thereof to Tenant and upon the expiration of the time fixed in such Notice, this Lease shall terminate and all rights of Tenant under this Lease shall cease. Landlord shall have and may exercise all rights and remedies available at law and in equity to Landlord as a result of Tenant s breach of this Lease, including, without limitation, the right of re-entry upon the Leased Property upon and at any time after the occurrence of an Event of Default. 
  12.2      Damages.    Neither the termination of this Lease, the repossession of the Leased Property, the failure of Landlord to relet the Leased Property, nor the reletting of all or any portion thereof shall relieve Tenant of its liability and obligations hereunder, all of which shall survive any such termination, repossession, or reletting to the maximum extent permitted by law. In the event of any such termination, Tenant shall forthwith pay to Landlord all Rent due and payable with respect to the Leased Property to and including the date of such termination. In addition, Tenant shall forthwith pay to Landlord, at Landlord s option, as and for liquidated and agreed current damages for Tenant s default, either: 
  (a)    Without termination of Tenant s rights to possession of the Leased Property, each installment of Rent (including Default Rent as determined below) and other sums payable to Tenant by Landlord under this Lease as the same becomes due and payable, which Rent and other sums shall bear interest at the Interest Rate from the date due until paid or otherwise discharged, and Landlord may enforce, by action or otherwise, any other term or covenant of this Lease; or 
  (b)    the sum of: 
  (i)    the unpaid Rent which had been earned at the time of termination, repossession, or reletting, and 
  (ii)    the worth at the time of termination, repossession, or reletting of the amount by which the unpaid Rent for the balance of the Term after the time of termination, repossession, or reletting, exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves could be reasonably avoided and as reduced for rentals received after the time of termination, repossession, or reletting, if and to the extent required by applicable law (the  worth at the time of termination, repossession, or reletting  of the amount referred to in this subparagraph (ii) is computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at the time of award plus 1%), and 
  (iii)    any other amount necessary to compensate Landlord for all the detriment proximately caused by Tenant s failure to perform its obligations under this Lease or which, in the ordinary course, would be likely to result therefrom. 
     Default Rent    for the purposes of this Section 12.2 shall be a sum equal to (A) the average of the annual amounts of the Percentage Rent for the three Fiscal Years immediately preceding the Fiscal Year in which the termination, re-entry, or repossession takes place, or (B) if three Fiscal Years shall not have elapsed, the average of the Percentage Rent during the preceding Fiscal Years during which this Lease was in effect, or (C) if one Fiscal Year has not elapsed, the amount derived by annualizing the Percentage Rent from the Commencement Date. 
  12.3      Waiver of Jury Trial.    Landlord and Tenant hereby waive, to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Laws, trial by jury in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim brought by any of the parties hereto against the other or in respect of any matter whatsoever arising out of or in any way connected with this Lease, the relationship of Landlord and Tenant hereunder, Tenant s occupancy of the Leased Property, and/or any claim for injury or damage. 
  12.4      Application of Funds.    Any payments received by Landlord under any of the provisions of this Lease during the existence or continuance of any Event of Default (and any payment made to Landlord rather than Tenant due to the existence of any Event of Default) shall be applied to Tenant s current and past due obligations under this Lease in such order as Landlord may determine or as may be required by Applicable Laws. 
  12.5      Landlord s Right to Cure Tenant s Default.    If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, then Landlord, after Notice to Tenant with a courtesy copy to the Management Parties (which Notice shall not be required if Landlord shall reasonably determine immediate action is necessary to protect person or property), without waiving or releasing any obligation of Tenant and without waiving or releasing any Event of Default, may (but shall not be obligated to), at any time thereafter, make such payment or perform such act for the account and at the expense of Tenant, and may, to the maximum extent permitted by law, enter upon the Leased Property or any portion thereof for such purpose and take all such action thereon as, in Landlord s sole and absolute discretion, may be necessary or appropriate therefor. No such entry shall be deemed an eviction of Tenant. All reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys  fees) incurred by Landlord in connection therewith, together with interest thereon (to the extent permitted by law) at the Interest Rate from the date such sums are paid by Landlord until repaid, shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord, on demand. 
  12.6      Good Faith Dispute.    If Tenant shall in good faith dispute the occurrence of any Default, then Tenant, before the expiration of the applicable cure period, shall give Notice thereof to Landlord, setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor and (provided Tenant shall escrow disputed amounts, if any, pursuant to an escrow arrangement reasonably acceptable to Landlord and Tenant) no Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred; provided, that in the event of any eventual adverse determination, Tenant shall pay to Landlord interest on any disputed funds at the Interest Rate, from the date demand for such funds was made by Landlord until the date of final adverse determination and, thereafter, at the Interest Rate until paid. 
  ARTICLE 13.      HOLDING OVER 
  Any holding over by Tenant after the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease shall be treated as a weekly tenancy at sufferance at a rate equal to twice the Rent and other charges herein provided (prorated on a daily basis). Tenant shall also pay to Landlord all damages (direct or indirect) sustained by reason of any such holding over. Otherwise, such holding over shall be on the terms and conditions set forth in this Lease, to the extent applicable. Nothing contained herein shall constitute the consent, express, or implied, of Landlord to the holding over of Tenant after the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease. 
  ARTICLE 14.      LANDLORD S NOTICE OBLIGATIONS; LANDLORD S DEFAULT 
  14.1      Landlord s Notice Obligation.    Landlord shall give prompt Notice to Tenant and the Management Parties of any materially adverse matters affecting the Leased Property of which Landlord receives written notice or actual, conscious, present knowledge, and, to the extent Tenant and/or the Management Parties otherwise has no notice or actual knowledge thereof, Landlord shall be liable for any liabilities, costs, damages, or claims (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys  fees) arising from the failure to deliver such Notice to Tenant. As used in this Lease,  Landlord s knowledge  or words of similar import shall mean the actual (and not constructive or imputed), conscious, present knowledge, without independent investigation or inquiry of William D. Rahm, Vivek Melwani, A.J. Agarwal, Tyler Henritze, Michael Barr, and Daniel Kamensky. 
  14.2      Landlord s Default.    (a) It shall be a breach of this Lease if Landlord fails to observe or perform any term, covenant, or condition of this Lease on its part to be performed and such failure continues for a period of 30 days after Notice thereof from Tenant, unless such failure cannot with due diligence be cured within a period of 30 days, in which case such failure shall not be deemed a breach if Landlord proceeds within such 30 day period, with due diligence, to commence to cure the failure and thereafter diligently completes the curing thereof. The time within which Landlord shall be obligated to cure any such failure also shall be subject to extension of time due to the occurrence of any Unavoidable Delay. If Landlord does not cure any such failure within the applicable time period as aforesaid, then Tenant may declare the existence of a    Landlord Default    by a second Notice to Landlord. Thereafter, Tenant may forthwith cure the same. Tenant shall have no right to terminate this Lease for any Landlord Default and no right, for any such Landlord Default, to offset or counterclaim against any Rent or other charges due hereunder. 
  (b)    If Landlord shall in good faith dispute the occurrence of a Landlord Default and Landlord, before the expiration of the applicable cure period, shall give Notice thereof to Tenant setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor, then no Landlord Default shall be deemed to have occurred and Landlord shall have no obligation with respect thereto until final adverse determination thereof, whether through arbitration or otherwise; provided, that in the event of any such adverse determination, Landlord shall pay to Tenant interest on any disputed funds at the Interest Rate, from the date demand for such funds was made by Tenant until the date of final adverse determination and, thereafter, at the Interest Rate until paid. If Tenant and Landlord shall fail, in good faith, to resolve any such dispute within 30 days after Landlord s Notice of dispute, then either may submit the matter for determination by arbitration, but only if such matter is required to be submitted to arbitration pursuant to any provision of this Lease, or otherwise by a court of competent jurisdiction. 
  14.3      Tenant s Right to Cure.    Subject to the provisions of Section 14.2, if Landlord breaches any covenant to be performed by it under this Lease, then Tenant after Notice to and demand upon Landlord as provided in Section 14.2, without waiving or releasing any obligation hereunder, may (but shall be under no obligation at any time thereafter to) make such payment or perform such act for the account and at the expense of Landlord. All sums so paid by Tenant and all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys  fees) so incurred, together with interest thereon at the Interest Rate from the date on which such sums or expenses are paid or incurred by Tenant, shall be paid by Landlord, to Tenant on demand. The rights of Tenant hereunder to cure and to secure payment from Landlord in accordance with this Section 14.3 shall survive the termination of this Lease with respect to the Leased Property. 
  ARTICLE 15.      TRANSFERS BY LANDLORD 
  Tenant acknowledges and agrees that Landlord has the unrestricted right to mortgage, encumber, convey and assign its interest in the Leased Property.  Tenant agrees and acknowledges that, at the request of Landlord and in consideration for the granting of the Leased Property to Tenant, Tenant shall enter into and execute certain documents, agreements or instruments to mortgage, encumber, convey and assign its interest in the Leased Property to further secure any financing obtained by Landlord.  If Landlord conveys the Leased Property in accordance with the terms hereof to a Mortgagee, or to a grantee or transferee that expressly assumes in writing all obligations of Landlord hereunder arising or accruing from and after the date of such conveyance or transfer, then Landlord shall thereupon be released from all future liabilities and obligations of Landlord under this Lease arising or accruing from and after the date of such conveyance or other transfer as to the Leased Property and all such future liabilities and obligations shall thereupon be binding upon the new owner.  
  ARTICLE 16.      SUBLETTING AND ASSIGNMENT 
  16.1      Subletting and Assignment.    (a) Except as provided in Section 16.3 and in this Section 16.1, Tenant shall not, without Landlord s prior written consent (which may be given or withheld by Landlord in its sole discretion), assign, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate, encumber, or otherwise transfer this Lease or sublease (which term shall be deemed to include the granting of concessions, licenses, and the like), all or any part of the Leased Property or suffer or permit this Lease or the leasehold estate created hereby or any other rights arising under this Lease to be assigned, transferred, mortgaged, pledged, hypothecated, or encumbered, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily, involuntarily, or by operation of law, or permit the use or operation of the Leased Property by anyone other than Tenant (but the foregoing is not to be construed to limit the Permitted Use or to restrict Tenant from engaging, or limit the requirement of Tenant to engage, the Management Parties or other hotel managers), or the Leased Property to be offered or advertised for assignment or subletting. For purposes of this Section 16.1, an assignment of this Lease shall be deemed to include the following: without Landlord s consent, any direct or indirect transfer of any interest in Tenant or any transaction pursuant to which Tenant is merged or consolidated with another Entity or pursuant to which all or substantially all of Tenant s assets are transferred to any other Entity, as if such change in control or transaction were an assignment of this Lease but shall not include any involuntary liens or attachments contested by Tenant in good faith in accordance with Article 8. 
  (b)    If this Lease is assigned or if the Leased Property or any part thereof is sublet (or occupied by anybody other than Tenant hereunder), then Landlord may collect the rents from such assignee, subtenant, or occupant, as the case may be, and apply the net amount collected to the Rent herein reserved, but no such collection shall be deemed a waiver of the provisions set forth in the first paragraph of  Section 16.1, the acceptance by Landlord of such assignee, subtenant, or occupant, as the case may be, as a tenant, or a release of Tenant from the future performance by Tenant of its covenants, agreements, or obligations contained in this Lease. 
  (c)    No subletting or assignment shall in any way impair the continuing primary liability of Tenant hereunder (unless Landlord and Tenant expressly otherwise agree that Tenant shall be released from all obligations hereunder), and no consent to any subletting or assignment in a particular instance shall be deemed to be a waiver of the prohibition set forth in Section 16.1. No assignment, subletting, or occupancy shall affect any Permitted Use. Any subletting, assignment, or other transfer of Tenant s interest under this Lease in contravention of Section 16.1 shall be voidable at Landlord s option. 
  16.2      Required Sublease Provisions.    Any sublease of any portion of the Leased Property entered into on or after the date hereof shall provide (a) that it is subject and subordinate to this Lease and to the matters to which this Lease is or shall be subject or subordinate; (b) that in the event of termination of this Lease or reentry or dispossession of Tenant by Landlord under this Lease, Landlord may, at its option, terminate such sublease or take over all of the right, title, and interest of Tenant, as sublessor under such sublease, and, except as provided below, such subtenant shall, at Landlord s option, attorn to Landlord pursuant to the then executory provisions of such sublease, except that neither Landlord nor any Mortgagee, as holder of a mortgage or as Landlord under this Lease, if such Mortgagee succeeds to that position, shall (i) be liable for any act or omission of Tenant under such sublease, (ii) be subject to any credit, counterclaim, offset, or defense which theretofore accrued to such subtenant against Tenant, (iii) be bound by any previous prepayment of more than one Accounting Period, (iv) be bound by any covenant of Tenant to undertake or complete any construction of the Leased Property or any portion thereof, (v) be required to account for any security deposit of the subtenant other than any security deposit actually delivered to Landlord by Tenant, (vi) be bound by any obligation to make any payment to such subtenant or grant any credits, except for services, repairs, maintenance, and restoration provided for under the sublease that are performed after the date of such attornment; (vii) be responsible for any monies owing by Tenant to the credit of such subtenant, or (viii) be required to remove any Person occupying any portion of the Leased Property; and (c) in the event that such subtenant receives a written Notice from Landlord or any Mortgagee stating that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such subtenant shall thereafter be obligated to pay all rentals accruing under such sublease directly to the party giving such Notice or as such party may direct. All rentals received from such subtenant by Landlord or the Mortgagee, as the case may be, shall be credited against the amounts owing by Tenant under this Lease and such sublease shall provide that the subtenant thereunder shall, at the request of Landlord, execute a suitable instrument in confirmation of such agreement to attorn. An original counterpart of each such sublease duly executed by Tenant and such subtenant shall be delivered promptly to Landlord and Tenant shall remain liable for the payment of the Rent and for the performance and observance of all of the covenants and conditions to be performed by Tenant hereunder. The provisions of this Section 16.2 shall not be deemed a waiver of the provisions set forth in Section 16.1(a). No subtenant that is an Affiliate of Tenant shall be required to attorn to Landlord as set forth above in this Section 16.2. 
  16.3      Permitted Sublease and Assignment.    Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to the provisions of Section 16.4 and any other express conditions or limitations set forth herein, Tenant may, without Landlord s consent, sublease space at the Leased Property for any uses ancillary to the Permitted Use, so long as such subleases do not demise, in the aggregate, in excess of 3,000 square feet (exclusive of any parking garage subleases), and will not violate or affect any Legal Requirement or Insurance Requirement. 
  16.4      Sublease Limitation.    For so long as Landlord or any Affiliate of Landlord or any Member or beneficiary of Landlord or any direct or indirect constituent owner thereof shall seek to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Code, anything contained in this Lease to the contrary notwithstanding, Tenant shall not sublet the Leased Property on any basis such that the rental to be paid by any sublessee thereunder would be based, in whole or in part, on either (a) the income or profits derived by the business activities of such sublessee or (b) any other formula such that any portion of such sublease rental would fail to qualify as  rents from real property  within the meaning of Section 856(d) of the Code, or any similar or successor provision thereto. 
  ARTICLE 17.      ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATES AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  17.1      Estoppel Certificates.    At any time and from time to time, upon not less than 10 Business Days prior Notice by either party, the party receiving such Notice shall furnish to the other a certificate certifying that this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect (or that this Lease is in full force and effect as modified and setting forth the modifications), the date to which the Rent has been paid, that to its knowledge no Default or an Event of Default by the other party has occurred and is continuing or, if a Default or an Event of Default shall exist, specifying in reasonable detail the nature thereof, and the steps being taken to remedy the same, and such additional information as the requesting party may reasonably request. If such additional information reasonably requires more than 10 Business Days to provide, then the party furnishing such information shall be entitled to such additional period to respond to such request as may be reasonably required under the circumstances. Any such certificate furnished pursuant to this Section 17.1 may be relied upon by the requesting party, its lenders, and any prospective purchaser or mortgagee of the Leased Property or the leasehold estate created hereby. 
  17.2      Accounting and Annual Reconciliation.    (a) Within 30 days after the close of each Accounting Period (or such earlier time period as required under the Management Agreement), Tenant shall cause the Management Parties to deliver an interim accounting (the    Accounting Period Statement   ) to Landlord showing Gross Revenues, and applications and distributions thereof for the preceding Accounting Period. Tenant shall cause the Management Parties to transfer to Tenant, with each Accounting Period Statement, any interim amounts due Tenant, subject to Working Capital needs, and shall retain any interim amounts due to the Management Parties. Calculations and payments of the Management Fees due to the Management Parties, and distributions to Tenant made with respect to each Accounting Period within a Fiscal Year shall be accounted for cumulatively. 
  (b)    Within 120 days after the end of each Fiscal Year (or such earlier time period as required under the Management Agreement), Tenant shall cause the Management Parties to deliver to Tenant and Landlord a statement (the    Annual Operating Statement   ) in reasonable detail summarizing the operations of the Hotels for the immediately preceding Fiscal Year, audited and certified by a nationally recognized firm of certified public accountants having hotel accounting experience as described in the Management Agreement. Landlord and Tenant shall promptly after Landlord s receipt of such Annual Operating Statement, make any adjustments, by cash payment, in the amounts paid or retained for such Fiscal Year as are needed because of the final figures set forth in such Annual Operating Statement as reconciled by the Management Parties and/or Tenant to the Accounting Period Statements. Such Annual Operating Statement shall be controlling over the preceding Accounting Period Statements. 
  17.3      Books and Records.    Books of control and account pertaining to operations at the Hotels shall be kept by Tenant, or by the Management Parties on behalf of Tenant, on the accrual basis and in all material respects in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts and GAAP. Tenant, upon Landlord s reasonable request and at reasonable intervals during the Management Parties  normal business hours, shall examine such records to seek to obtain such information therefrom as reasonably directed by Landlord. 
  17.4      Business Plan.    (a) Tenant shall cause the Management Parties to deliver to Landlord and Tenant for their review and approval, in accordance with the Management Agreement, a business plan showing the estimated Gross Revenues for the forthcoming Fiscal Year, in comparison to the forecasted Gross Revenues for the current Fiscal Year, each in a reasonably itemized and detailed, as well as summary, form. Such comparison shall include the estimated percentage changes in such items for the forthcoming Fiscal Year compared to the current Fiscal Year. Tenant shall also cause the Management Parties to submit to Landlord for Landlord s approval the Capital Reserve Budget described in Section 5.2(c) and the Building Estimate described in Section 5.3 at the same time that it submits the business plan. Tenant shall cause the Management Parties to prepare the business plan in accordance with the standards set forth in this Lease and the Management Agreement. Landlord shall have 5 Business Days after receipt of the business plan to review and approve such business plan, and, in the event that Landlord disapproves any category in the business plan, Landlord shall notify Tenant, and Tenant shall, in turn provide the Management Parties in writing, with the specific reasons for Landlord s disapproval, by category, within such 5 Business Day period. Landlord and Tenant will attempt to resolve in good faith any such objections by Landlord within 5 Business Days following the Management Parties  receipt of Tenant s notice of Landlord s disapproval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord shall not be entitled to withhold its approval with respect to costs that are system-wide for Manager s System, including, without limitation, any system-wide compensation or benefit programs; provided, that such programs are reasonably comparable to others in the hospitality industry. Pending such agreement, Tenant shall operate, or cause the Management Parties to operate, the Hotels with respect to those categories that are in dispute based on the previous Fiscal Year s approved Business Plan, adjusted in accordance with changes in the GDP Deflator over the Fiscal Year just ended and anticipated changes in Gross Revenues. If Landlord fails to provide any objection within the initial 5 Business Day period set forth above, the business plan as submitted by the Management Parties shall be deemed approved. If Landlord and Tenant cannot resolve in good faith any such objections by Landlord within the second 5 Business Day period set forth above, then Landlord s determination in respect of such objections shall control. The approved business plan for each Fiscal Year is herein referred to as the    Business Plan   . 
  (b)    Tenant shall cause the Management Parties to diligently operate the Hotels in accordance with the Business Plan. 
  (c)    In addition to the information described in the first sentence of Section 17.4(a), upon Landlord s request, Tenant shall cause the Management Parties to include (to the extent reasonably available to the Management Parties) the following information along with each business plan submitted to Landlord pursuant to the provisions of  Section 17.4(a): (i) general information concerning pay scales and benefits programs applicable to employees of the Hotels, the Management Parties  general staffing policies, and the Management Parties  plans for staffing levels at the Hotels for the forthcoming Fiscal Year; (ii) the Management Parties  marketing plan for the forthcoming Fiscal Year; (iii) estimates of furniture, fixtures, and equipment and Capital Expenditure requirements and expenditures for the forthcoming three Fiscal Years; and (iv) estimates of the Hotels  Working Capital and Fixed Asset Supply needs for the forthcoming Fiscal Year. 
  ARTICLE 18.      LANDLORD S RIGHT TO INSPECT 
  The parties acknowledge that Landlord is a direct or indirect controlled subsidiary of an entity, Extended Stay America, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the    REOC Parent   ), that is intended to qualify as a  real estate operating company  (a    REOC   ) within the meaning of the U.S. Department of Labor plan assets regulation (Section 2510.3-101, Part 2510 of Chapter XXV, Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations) and that it is intended that Landlord will have the rights, pursuant to this Lease, as would be reasonably necessary to result in the qualification of REOC Parent as a REOC. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, notwithstanding any other provision of this Lease, without prejudice to the other rights provided to Landlord under this Lease, Tenant agrees to: (a) permit Landlord and REOC Parent to visit and inspect the Leased Property, to make such repairs as Landlord is permitted or required to make pursuant to the terms of this Lease, and inspect and copy the books and records of Tenant, at such times as Landlord shall reasonably request; provided, that any inspection or repair by Landlord and REOC Parent or their representatives will not unreasonably interfere with Tenant s or the Management Parties  use and operation of the Leased Property; (b) periodically (at least quarterly) provide Landlord and REOC Parent with information and reports regarding Tenant s or the Management Parties  operation and management of the Leased Property and the performance of its duties under this Lease and with respect to renovations, alterations, general maintenance, repairs, and development activities that Tenant has engaged in or intends to engage in with respect to the Leased Property and its surroundings; (c) periodically (at least quarterly) consult with Landlord and REOC Parent in advance with respect to any right retained under this Lease and with respect to Tenant s operation and management of the Leased Property, as appropriate, and the performance of Tenant s duties under this Lease including, without limitation, with respect to matters relating to renovations, alterations, general maintenance, repairs, and development activities with respect to the Leased Property and its surroundings; and (d) to provide Landlord and REOC Parent with such other rights as may reasonably be determined by Landlord to be necessary to enable REOC Parent to qualify as a REOC; provided, that such additional rights do not materially adversely affect (A) Tenant s ability to perform its duties under this Lease or the economic benefits enjoyed by Tenant under this Lease or (B) the status of ESH Hospitality as a real estate investment trust under the Code. Tenant agrees to consider, in good faith, the recommendations of Landlord in connection with the matters on which it is consulted as described above. 
  ARTICLE 19.      INTENTIONALLY OMITTED 
  ARTICLE 20.      LIMITATIONS 
  20.1      REIT Compliance.    Landlord is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of ESH Hospitality. Tenant acknowledges that ESH Hospitality intends to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Code. Tenant agrees that it will not knowingly or intentionally take or omit to take any action, or permit any status or condition to exist at the Leased Property, which Tenant actually knows (acting in good faith) would or could result in (a) the Rent payable under this Lease not qualifying as  rents from real property  as defined in Section 856(d) of the Code or (b) ESH Hospitality being disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust under the Code as the provisions exist on the date hereof; provided, that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (A) Tenant shall not be responsible for any act or omission of Landlord or the Management Parties (unless the Management Parties  action was with the express written consent, or at the direction, of Tenant), and (B) any action by Tenant taken in compliance with the express terms of this Lease or the Management Agreement shall not be deemed to create a Default or Event of Default under this Section 20.1.  
  20.2      Sublease Rent Limitation.    Anything contained in this Lease to the contrary notwithstanding, from and after the Commencement Date, Tenant shall not knowingly or intentionally (acting in good faith) enter into any sublease with respect to the Leased Property or any part thereof on any basis such that the rental to be paid by the sublessee thereunder would be based (or considered to be based), in whole or in part, on either (a) the income or profits derived by the business activities of the sublessee, or (b) any other formula such that any portion of the rent payable hereunder would or could, to Tenant s actual knowledge (acting in good faith), fail to qualify as  rents from real property  within the meaning of Section 856(d) of the Code, or any similar or successor provisions thereto. 
  ARTICLE 21.      MISCELLANEOUS 
  21.1      No Waiver.    No failure by Landlord or Tenant to insist upon the strict performance of any term hereof or to exercise any right, power, or remedy consequent upon a breach thereof, and no acceptance of full or partial payment of Rent during the continuance of any such breach, shall constitute a waiver of any such breach or of any such term. To the maximum extent permitted by law, no waiver of any breach shall affect or alter this Lease, which shall continue in full force and effect with respect to any other then existing or subsequent breach. 
  21.2      Remedies Cumulative.    To the maximum extent permitted, by law, each legal, equitable, or contractual right, power, and remedy of Landlord or Tenant, now or hereafter provided either in this Lease or by statute or otherwise, shall be cumulative and concurrent and shall be in addition to every other right, power, and remedy and the exercise or beginning of the exercise by Landlord or Tenant (as applicable) of any one or more of such rights, powers, and remedies shall not preclude the simultaneous or subsequent exercise by Landlord of any or all of such other rights, powers, and remedies. 
  21.3      Severability.    Any clause, sentence, paragraph, section, or provision of this Lease held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or ineffective shall not impair, invalidate, or nullify the remainder of this Lease, but rather the effect thereof shall be confined to the clause, sentence, paragraph, section, or provision so held to be invalid, illegal, or ineffective, and this Lease shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal, or ineffective provisions had never been contained herein. 
  21.4      Acceptance of Surrender.    No surrender to Landlord of this Lease or of the Leased Property or any part thereof, or of any interest therein, shall be valid or effective unless agreed to and accepted in writing by Landlord and no act by Landlord or any representative or agent of Landlord, other than such a written acceptance by Landlord, shall constitute an acceptance of any such surrender. 
  21.5      No Merger of Title.    It is expressly acknowledged and agreed that it is the intent of the parties that there shall be no merger of this Lease or of the leasehold estate created hereby by reason of the fact that the same Person may acquire, own, or hold, directly or indirectly, this Lease or the leasehold estate created hereby and the fee estate or ground landlord s interest in the Leased Property. 
  21.6      Conveyance by Landlord.    If Landlord or any successor owner of all or any portion of the Leased Property shall convey all or any portion of the Leased Property in accordance with the terms of this Lease other than as security for a debt, and the grantee or transferee of such of the Leased Property shall expressly assume all obligations of Landlord hereunder with respect to such of the Leased Property arising or accruing from and after the date of such conveyance or transfer, then Landlord or such successor owner, as the case may be, shall thereupon be released from all future liabilities and obligations of Landlord under this Lease with respect to such of the Leased Property arising or accruing from and after the date of such conveyance or other transfer and all such future liabilities and obligations shall thereupon be binding upon the new owner. 
  21.7      Quiet Enjoyment.    Provided that no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Tenant shall peaceably and quietly have, hold, and enjoy the Leased Property for the Term, free of hindrance or molestation by Landlord or anyone claiming by, through, or under Landlord, but subject to (a) any encumbrance permitted to be created by Landlord hereunder, (b) liens as to obligations of Landlord that are either not yet due or which are being contested in good faith and by proper proceedings; provided, that the same do not materially interfere with Tenant s or the Management Parties  ability to operate the Hotels, and (c) liens that have been consented to in writing by Tenant. Except as otherwise provided in this Lease, no failure by Landlord to comply with the foregoing covenant shall give Tenant the right to cancel or terminate this Lease or abate, reduce, or make a deduction from or offset against the Rent or any other sum payable under this Lease ,or to fail to perform any other obligation of Tenant hereunder. 
  21.8      Registration.    Neither Tenant nor anyone on Tenant s behalf or claiming under Tenant shall register this Lease or any assignment or sublease against the Leased Property.

Upon the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, Tenant shall promptly discharge or otherwise vacate any such notice or caveat.

  21.10      Notices.    (a) Any and all notices, demands, consents, approvals, offers, elections, and other communications required or permitted under this Lease shall be deemed adequately given if in writing and the same shall be delivered either in hand, or by mail, or Federal Express or similar expedited commercial carrier, addressed to the recipient of the notice, postpaid, and registered or certified with return receipt requested (if by mail), or with all freight charges prepaid (if by Federal Express or similar carrier). 
  (b)    All notices required or permitted to be sent hereunder shall be deemed to have been given for all purposes of this Lease upon the date of receipt or refusal, except that whenever under this Lease a notice is either received on a day which is not a Business Day or is required to be delivered on or before a specific day which is not a Business Day, the day of receipt or required delivery shall automatically be extended to the next Business Day.

  (d)    By notice given as herein provided, the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns shall have the right from time to time and at any time during the term of this Lease to change their respective addresses effective upon receipt by the other parties of such notice and each shall have the right to specify as its address any other address within the United States of America or Canada.  
  21.11      Construction; Nonrecourse.    Neither this Lease nor any provision hereof may be changed, waived, discharged, or terminated except by an instrument in writing signed by all the parties thereto. All the terms and provisions of this Lease shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns. Each term or provision of this Lease to be performed by Tenant shall be construed as an independent covenant and condition. Time is of the essence with respect to the exercise of any rights of Tenant or Landlord under this Lease. In the event of any dispute between the parties concerning this Lease, Landlord shall be entitled to an award of attorney s fees and costs in connection with such dispute, including, without limitation, in connection with any suit, action, arbitration, or other proceeding concerning such dispute. Except as otherwise set forth in this Lease, any obligations arising prior to the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease of Tenant (including, without limitation, any monetary, repair, and indemnification obligations) and Landlord shall survive the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease; provided, that each of Landlord and Tenant shall be required to give the other Notice of any such surviving and unsatisfied obligations within one year after the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease. Nothing contained in this Lease shall be construed to create or impose any liabilities or obligations and no such liabilities or obligations shall be imposed on any of the shareholders, beneficial owners, direct or indirect, officers, directors, trustees, employees, or agents of Landlord or Tenant for the payment or performance of the obligations or liabilities of Landlord or Tenant hereunder. Further, in the event Landlord shall be in default under this Lease, and if as a consequence of such default, Tenant shall recover a money judgment against Landlord, then such judgment shall be satisfied only out of the proceeds of sale received upon execution of such judgment against the right, title, and interest of Landlord in the Leased Property. 
  21.12      Counterparts; Headings.    This Lease may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but which, when taken together, shall constitute but one instrument and shall become effective as of the date hereof when copies hereof, which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the parties hereto shall have been signed. Headings in this Lease are for purposes of reference only and shall not limit or affect the meaning of the provisions hereof. 
  21.13      Applicable Law.    This Lease shall be interpreted, construed, applied, and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York; provided, that the provisions for the enforcement of Landlord s rights and remedies hereunder shall be governed by the laws of each of the respective jurisdictions where the Leased Property is located to the extent necessary for the validity and enforcement thereof. 
  21.14      Right to Make Agreement.    Each party warrants, with respect to itself, that neither the execution of this Lease, nor the consummation of any transaction contemplated hereby, shall violate any provision of any law, or any judgment, writ, injunction, order, or decree of any court or governmental authority having jurisdiction over it; nor result in or constitute a breach or default under any indenture, contract, or other commitment or restriction to which it is a party or by which it is bound; nor require any consent, vote, or approval which has not been given or taken, or at the time of the transaction involved shall not have been given or taken. Each party covenants that it has and will continue to have, throughout the term of this Lease and any extensions thereof, the full right to enter into this Lease and perform its obligations hereunder. 
  21.15      Disclosure of Information.    (a) The parties hereto agree that the matters set forth in this Lease and any revenue, expense, net profit, room rate, and occupancy information provided on a Hotel by Hotel basis are strictly confidential and each party will make every effort to ensure that the information is not disclosed to any Person that is not an Affiliate of any party (including the press) without the prior written consent of the other party, except as may be required by law and as may be reasonably necessary to obtain licenses, permits, and other public approvals necessary for the refurbishment or operation of the Hotels, or, in connection with a Landlord financing, a sale of a Hotel, or a sale of a Controlling Interest in Landlord or Tenant. 
  (b)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing provisions of this Section 21.15 or elsewhere in this Lease, any party (and any employee, representative, or other agent of any party) may disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated by this Lease and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to any party relating to such tax treatment and tax structure; provided, that any such information and materials shall be kept confidential to the extent necessary to comply with any applicable securities laws. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated by this Lease shall not be deemed to include the identity of the parties, the location of the Leased Property, or the amount of Rent payable by Tenant hereunder. The foregoing authorization of disclosure is retroactively effective immediately upon commencement of the first discussions among the parties regarding the transactions contemplated hereby, and the parties aver and affirm that this tax disclosure authorization has been given on a date which is no later than 30 days from the first day that any party (or any employee, representative, or other agent of a party) first made or provided a statement as to the potential federal income tax consequences that may result from the transactions contemplated hereby. 
  (c)    The obligations of Tenant and Landlord contained in this Section 21.15 shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease. 
  21.16      Operating Lease.    The parties hereto intend that this Lease shall be deemed for all purposes to be an operating lease and not a capital lease. 
  21.17      No Joint Venture or Partnership.    Landlord and Tenant intend that the relationship created hereunder be solely that of landlord and tenant. Nothing herein is intended to create a joint venture, partnership, tenancy-in-common, or joint tenancy relationship between Landlord and Tenant. 
  21.18      Planning Act (Ontario).    It is an express condition of this Lease that the subdivision control provisions of the applicable provincial legislation be complied with, if necessary. If such compliance is necessary, then Tenant covenants and agrees to proceed diligently, at Tenant s expense, to obtain the required consent and Landlord agrees to cooperate, at Tenant s expense, with Tenant in bringing such application. 
  21.19      Distress.    Notwithstanding any provision of this Lease or any provision of any applicable legislation, none of the goods and chattels of Tenant on the Leased Property at any time during the Term shall be exempt from levy by distress for Rent in arrears, and Tenant waives any such exemption. If Landlord makes any claim against the goods and chattels of Tenant by way of distress, this provision may be pleaded as an estoppel against Tenant in any action brought to test the right of Landlord to levy such distress. 
  21.20      Beneficial Owner Ratification.    Beneficial Owner ratifies and confirms that it has irrevocably authorized and directed Landlord to execute and deliver this Lease and that such authorization and direction shall constitute Beneficial Owner s giving of full and sufficient authority to Landlord for Landlord to execute and deliver this Lease. Landlord and Beneficial Owner acknowledge that Tenant is relying on such authorization and direction and that Tenant shall not be obliged to look further into the terms of the trust between Landlord and Beneficial Owner. 
  21.21      Amendment and Restatement.    The parties agree that the Original Lease Agreement is hereby amended and restated.  The parties agree that (i) the terms and conditions of the Original Lease Agreement shall be amended as set forth herein and, as so amended, shall be restated in their entirety, but shall be amended only with respect to the rights, title, estates, interest, liabilities, duties, covenants, obligations and agreements among the parties accruing from and after the date hereof.  The execution, delivery and effectiveness of this Lease shall not constitute a waiver of any covenant, agreement or obligation under the Original Lease Agreement, except to the extent that any such covenant, agreement or obligation is no longer set forth herein or is modified hereby.

  (v)        Tenant shall deliver to Landlord a statement with each Percentage Rent payment setting forth the true and correct calculation of the Percentage Rent payment for the most recently completed month of each Fiscal Year in the Term and the Percentage Rent year-to-date through such recently completed month. Percentage Rent shall be subject to confirmation and adjustment, if applicable, as set forth in Section 3.3. 
  (c)        The obligation to pay Rent shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, and a final reconciliation, taking into account, among other relevant adjustments, any adjustments which are accrued after such expiration or termination date but which related to Rent accrued prior to such expiration or termination date, shall be made not later than 30 days after such expiration or termination date. 
  (d)        Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, in the event that cash available from Gross Revenues after payment by Tenant of all expenses due and payable by Tenant under this Lease is insufficient to pay the aggregate amount of Percentage Rent due for such month, then the amount of such deficiency shall be deferred and added to and paid in connection with the next monthly Percentage Rent payment or payments hereunder; provided, that any Percentage Rent deferred as herein provided shall in any event be due and payable and paid prior to the end of the Fiscal Year in which such deferral occurred unless Landlord, in its sole and absolute discretion, elects to permit further deferral of such Percentage Rent for a period determined by Landlord, in which case any such Percentage Rent that is deferred beyond the end of such Fiscal Year shall (i) accrue interest at a rate equal to the Interest Rate for the period commencing on the day after the last day of such Fiscal Year and ending on the date on which Tenant pays such Percentage Rent to Landlord and (ii) be due and payable, together with all accrued interest, on or prior to the last day of the extended deferral period so determined by Landlord. 
  (e)        Minimum Rent payable each Fiscal Year pursuant to Section 3.1(a) shall be allocated to each Hotel in the amounts set forth in Exhibit A. 
  (f)        If at any time during the Term it becomes necessary to revise any of the Exhibits to this Lease whether as required in accordance with the provisions of this Lease or as a result of the agreement of Landlord and Tenant, and whether to reflect changes in the Leased Properties, the allocation or amount of Minimum Rent, the calculation of Percentage Rent, or otherwise, then Landlord shall update the applicable Exhibit to reflect such revision(s) and shall deliver Notice and a copy thereof to Tenant. Any such revised Exhibit, to the extent such revision(s) was/were required in accordance with the provisions of this Lease, shall be binding on Tenant absent manifest error, and any other such revised Exhibit shall be binding on Tenant upon Tenant s counter-execution of the same. 
   
  3.2        HST  .  (a) Tenant shall pay, or cause the Management Parties to pay, to Landlord, by wire transfer of immediately available funds or by other means acceptable to Landlord in its sole discretion, in lawful money of Canada which shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts, the full amount of all HST and any other similar taxes imposed in respect of the Rent payable by Tenant under this Lease or in respect of the rental of space under this Lease (such taxes, collectively, the    Rental Taxes   ). Tenant shall pay the Rental Taxes whether they are characterized as HST, sales taxes, value-added taxes, multi-stage taxes, business transfer taxes, or otherwise, with the intent that Landlord be fully indemnified in respect of all Rental Taxes payable or collectible by Landlord in respect of the Rent or the rental of space under this Lease. The Rental Taxes payable by the Tenant (a) shall be calculated by Landlord in accordance with the applicable law; (b) shall be paid to Landlord at the same time as the amounts to which the Rental Taxes apply are payable to Landlord under this Lease; and (c) notwithstanding anything to the contrary, shall not be considered to be Rent (but Landlord will have all of the same remedies for, and rights of recovery with respect to, such amounts, as it has for non-payment of Rent under this Lease or at law). 
  (a)        Landlord shall give to Tenant a written receipt for all payments of Rent and the Rental Taxes made pursuant to this Lease, which receipt shall indicate Landlord s HST registration number and the amounts so paid. Landlord and Tenant agree that HST shall only be calculated on Rent in Canadian Dollars (and, for the avoidance of doubt, not taking into account any conversion to Dollars provided for in this Lease). 
   
  3.3        Confirmation of Percentage Rent.    Tenant shall utilize, or cause to be utilized, an accounting system for the Leased Property in accordance with its usual and customary practices, and in accordance with GAAP and the Uniform System of Accounts, that will accurately record all data necessary to compute Percentage Rent, and Tenant shall retain, for at least five years after the expiration of each Lease Year, reasonably adequate records conforming to such accounting system showing all data necessary to conduct Landlord s audit and to compute Percentage Rent for the applicable Lease Year. Landlord shall have the right, for a period of two years following each Lease Year, from time to time, by its accountants or representatives, to audit such information in connection with Landlord s audit, and to examine all Tenant s records (including supporting data and sales and excise tax returns) reasonably required to complete Landlord s audit and to verify the Percentage Rent, subject to any prohibitions or limitations on disclosure of any such data under Legal Requirements. If any Landlord s audit discloses a deficiency in the payment of Percentage Rent, and either Tenant agrees with the results of Landlord s audit or the matter is otherwise determined or compromised, then Tenant shall forthwith pay to Landlord the amount of the deficiency, as finally agreed or determined, together with interest at the Interest Rate from the date when said payment should have been made to the date of payment thereof. If any Landlord s audit discloses a deficiency in the determination or reporting of Gross Revenue, which, as finally agreed or determined, exceeds three percent, Tenant shall pay the costs of the portion of Landlord s audit allocable to the determination of such Revenues. Any proprietary information obtained by Landlord pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3.3 shall be treated as confidential, except that such information may be used, subject to appropriate confidentiality safeguards, in any litigation or arbitration between the parties and except further that Landlord may disclose such information to prospective lenders, investors, and underwriters and to any other persons to whom disclosure is necessary to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and government requirements. The obligations of Tenant contained in this Section 3.3 shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease. Any dispute as to the existence or amount of any deficiency in the payment of Percentage Rent as disclosed by Landlord s audit shall, if not otherwise settled by the parties, be submitted to arbitration. 
   
  3.4        Additional Charges.    In addition to Minimum Rent or Percentage Rent payable under Section 3.1 of this Lease, (a) Tenant also will pay and discharge as and when due and payable all other amounts, liabilities, obligations, and Impositions that Tenant assumes or agrees to pay under this Lease, and (b) in the event of any failure on the part of Tenant to pay any of those items referred to in clause (a) of this Section 3.4, Tenant also will promptly pay and discharge every fine, penalty, interest, and cost that may be added for non-payment or late payment of such items (the items referred to in clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 3.4 being additional rent hereunder and being referred to herein collectively as    Additional Charges   ), and Landlord shall have all legal, equitable, and contractual rights, powers, and remedies provided either in this Lease or by statute or otherwise in the case of non-payment of Additional Charges as in the case of non-payment of Minimum Rent or Percentage Rent. If any installment of Minimum Rent, Percentage Rent or Additional Charges (but only as to those Additional Charges that are payable directly to Landlord) shall not be paid on its due date, then Tenant will pay Landlord within 10 days after demand, as Additional Charges, an amount equal to the interest computed at the Interest Rate on the amount of such installment, from the due date of such installment to the date of payment thereof. To the extent that Tenant pays any Additional Charges to Landlord pursuant to the requirements of this Lease, Tenant shall be relieved of its obligation to pay such Additional Charges to the entity to which they would otherwise be due and Landlord shall pay the same from monies received from Tenant. 
   
  3.5        Payment of Impositions.   (a) (%4)  Subject to Article 8 relating to permitted contests, Tenant shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Impositions before any fine, penalty, interest, or cost (other than any opportunity cost as a result of a failure to take advantage of any discount for early payment) may be added for non-payment, such payments to be made directly to the taxing authorities where feasible, and shall promptly, upon request, furnish to Landlord copies of official receipts or other reasonably satisfactory proof evidencing such payments. If any such Imposition may, at the option of the taxpayer, lawfully be paid in installments (whether or not interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance of such Imposition), Tenant may exercise the option to pay the same (and any accrued interest on the unpaid balance of such Imposition) in installments and, in such event, shall pay such installments during the Term as the same become due and before any fine, penalty, premium, further interest, or cost may be added thereto. 
  (i)        Landlord, at its expense, shall, to the extent required or permitted by Applicable Law, prepare and file all tax returns and pay all taxes due in respect of Landlord s net income, gross receipts, sales and use, single business,   ad valorem  , franchise taxes, and taxes on its capital stock, and Tenant, at its expense, shall, to the extent required or permitted by Applicable Laws, prepare and file all other tax returns and reports in respect of any Imposition as may be required by Government Agencies. 
  (ii)        If any refund shall be due from any taxing authority in respect of any Imposition paid by Tenant, then the same shall be paid over to or retained by Tenant if no Event of Default shall have occurred hereunder and be continuing. If an Event of Default shall have been declared by Landlord and be continuing, then any such refund shall be paid over to or retained by Landlord. 
  (iii)        Landlord and Tenant shall, upon request of the other, provide such data as is maintained by the party to whom the request is made with respect to the Leased Property as may be necessary to prepare any required returns and reports. 
  (iv)        In the event Government Agencies classify any property covered by this Lease as personal property, then Tenant shall file, or cause the Management Parties to file, all personal property tax returns in such jurisdictions where it may legally so file.

  (v)        Landlord shall provide Tenant with copies of assessment notices in sufficient time for Tenant to prepare a protest which Landlord shall file. Landlord may, upon notice to Tenant, at Landlord s option and at Landlord s sole expense, appeal, protest, or institute such other proceedings (in its or Tenant s name) as Landlord may deem appropriate to effect a reduction of real estate assessments and Tenant shall fully cooperate with Landlord in such protest, appeal, or other action. 
  (vi)        Landlord shall give prompt Notice to Tenant of all Impositions payable by Tenant hereunder of which Landlord at any time has knowledge; provided, however, that Landlord s failure to give any such notice shall in no way diminish Tenant s obligation hereunder to pay such Impositions (except that Landlord shall be responsible for any interest or penalties incurred as a result of Landlord s failure promptly to forward the same). 
  (vii)        In addition, Tenant shall pay the following: 
  (A)        Utility Charges.    Tenant shall pay or cause to be paid all charges for electricity, power, gas, oil, water, and other utilities used in connection with the Leased Property.

  (b)        Reimbursement for Additional Charges.    If Tenant pays or causes to be paid property taxes or similar or other Additional Charges attributable to periods after the end of the Term, whether upon expiration or sooner termination of this Lease, then Tenant may, within a reasonable time after the end of the Term, provide Notice to Landlord of Tenant s estimate of such amounts. Landlord shall promptly reimburse Tenant for all payments of such taxes and other similar Additional Charges that are attributable to any period after the Term of this Lease. 
   
  3.6        Late Payment of Rent, Etc.

To the extent that Tenant pays any Additional Charges directly to Landlord or any Mortgagee pursuant to any requirement of this Lease, Tenant shall be relieved of its obligation to pay such Additional Charges to the Entity to which they would otherwise be due and Landlord shall pay when due, or cause the applicable Mortgagee to pay when due, such Additional Charges to the Entity to which they are due. If any payment due from Landlord to Tenant shall not be paid within 30 days after its due date, then Landlord shall pay to Tenant, on demand, a late charge (to the extent permitted by law) computed at the Interest Rate on the amount of such installment from the due date of such installment to the date of payment thereof.

Landlord shall have all legal, equitable, and contractual rights, powers, and remedies provided either in this Lease or by statute or otherwise in the case of non-payment of Additional Charges as in the case of non-payment of Minimum Rent and Percentage Rent.

  Subject to Article 8, Tenant shall not, and Tenant shall ensure that the Management Parties do not, directly or indirectly, create or allow to remain, and each shall promptly discharge, at its expense, any lien, encumbrance, attachment, title retention agreement, or claim upon the Leased Property or Tenant s leasehold interest therein or any attachment, levy, claim, or encumbrance in respect of the Rent, other than (a) restrictions, liens, and other encumbrances which are consented to in writing by Landlord, (b) liens for those taxes of Landlord which Tenant is not required to pay hereunder, (c) subleases permitted by Article 16, (d) liens for Impositions or for sums resulting from noncompliance with Legal Requirements so long as (i) the same are not yet due and payable, or (ii) are being contested in accordance with Article 8, (e) liens of mechanics, laborers, materialmen, suppliers, or vendors incurred in the ordinary course of business that are not yet due and payable (but will be paid in full by Tenant or the Management Parties) or are for sums that are being contested in accordance with Article 8, (f) any Mortgage or other liens which are the responsibility of Landlord, and (g) Landlord Liens. 
   
  Article 8.          PERMITTED CONTESTS 
  Tenant, or the Management Parties at Tenant s direction, shall have the right to contest the amount or validity of any Imposition, Legal Requirement, Insurance Requirement, lien, attachment, levy, encumbrance, charge, or claim (collectively,    Claims   ) as to the Leased Property, by appropriate legal proceedings, conducted in good faith and with due diligence; provided, that (a) the foregoing shall in no way be construed as relieving, modifying, or extending Tenant s obligation to pay any Claims required hereunder to be paid by Tenant as finally determined, (b) such contest shall not cause Landlord or Tenant to be in default under any mortgage, deed of trust, or other agreement encumbering the Leased Property or any part thereof (Landlord agreeing that any such mortgage, deed of trust, or other agreement shall permit Tenant to exercise the rights granted pursuant to this Article 8) or any interest therein or result in a lien attaching to the Leased Property, unless such lien is fully bonded or is otherwise secured to the reasonable satisfaction of Landlord, (c) no part of the Leased Property nor any Rent therefrom shall be in any immediate danger of sale, forfeiture, attachment, or loss, and (d) Tenant hereby indemnifies and holds harmless Landlord from and against any cost, claim, damage, penalty, or reasonable expense, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys  fees, incurred by Landlord in connection therewith or as a result thereof. Landlord agrees to join in any such proceedings if required legally to prosecute such contest; provided, that Landlord shall not thereby be subjected to any liability therefor (including, without limitation, for the payment of any costs or expenses in connection therewith) unless Tenant agrees to assume and indemnify Landlord with respect to the same. Tenant or the Management Parties, as applicable, shall be entitled to any refund of any Claims and such charges and penalties or interest thereon which have been paid by Tenant or paid by Landlord to the extent that Landlord has been reimbursed by Tenant. If Tenant shall fail to pay or cause to be paid any Claims when finally determined, to provide reasonable security therefor, or to prosecute or cause to be prosecuted any such contest diligently and in good faith, then Landlord may, upon Notice to Tenant, pay such charges, together with interest and penalties due with respect thereto, and Tenant shall reimburse Landlord therefor, upon demand, as Additional Charges. 
   
  Article 9.          INSURANCE 
   
  9.1        General Insurance Requirements.     
  (a)        Coverages by Tenant.    During the Term, Tenant shall at its expense keep the insurance described in Sections 9.1(b)(i) through (v). This insurance shall be written by companies authorized to issue insurance in the jurisdiction where the Leased Property is located and otherwise acceptable to Landlord. If required by Landlord, the policies must name Landlord as an additional named insured. 
  (i)        Property casualty insurance with limits and deductibles as may be reasonably required by Landlord. 
  (ii)        General liability insurance with limits and deductibles as may be reasonably required by Landlord. 
  (iii)        Fidelity bonds with limits and deductibles as may be reasonably required by Landlord, covering Tenant s employees in job classifications normally bonded under prudent hotel management practices in the United States or otherwise required by law. 
  (iv)        Workers  compensation benefits and employers  liability insurance for all persons employed by Tenant or the Management Parties on the Leased Property to the extent necessary to protect Landlord and the Leased Property against Tenant s workers  compensation claims. 
  (v)        Vehicle liability insurance for owned, non-owned, and hired vehicles, including, without limitation, rented and leased vehicles containing minimum limits per occurrence of $1,000,000.00. 
  (vi)        Such other insurance relating to the operation of the Hotel business as Landlord may reasonably request; provided, that such other insurance is customary for facilities such as the Leased Property and the operation thereof. 
   
  9.2        Waiver of Subrogation.    All insurance policies carried by Landlord or Tenant covering the Leased Property, the FF E, the Hotels, or Tenant s Personal Property, including, without limitation, contents, fire, and casualty insurance, shall expressly waive any right of subrogation on the part of the insurer against the other party. Landlord and Tenant agree that their policies will include such waiver clause or endorsement so long as the same are obtainable without extra cost, and in the event of such an extra cost the other party, at its election, may pay the same, but shall not be obligated to do so. Each party agrees to seek recovery from any applicable insurance coverage prior to seeking recovery against the other. 
   
  9.3        Form Satisfactory, Etc.    All of the policies of insurance referred to in this Article 9 shall be written in a form, with deductibles and by insurance companies reasonably satisfactory to Landlord and also shall meet and satisfy the requirements of any ground lessor, lender, or franchisor having any interest in the Leased Property. Tenant shall deliver to Landlord policies or certificates of the insurance required under Section 9.1(b) as of their effective date (and, with respect to any renewal policy, upon or prior to the expiration of the existing policy), and in the event of the failure of Tenant either to obtain such insurance as herein called for or to pay the premiums therefor, or to deliver such policies or certificates thereof to Landlord at the times required, Landlord shall be entitled, but shall have no obligation, to obtain such insurance and pay the premiums therefor, and Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for any premium or premiums paid by Landlord for the coverages required under Section 9.1(b) upon written demand therefor, and repay the same within 30 days after Notice of such failure from Landlord shall constitute an Event of Default. Each insurer mentioned in this Article 9 shall agree, by endorsement to the policy or policies issued by it, or by independent instrument furnished to Landlord, to provide 30 days  written notice to Landlord before the policy or policies in question shall be materially altered, allowed to expire, or canceled. 
   
  9.4        Blanket Policy.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article 9, Tenant or Landlord may bring the insurance provided for herein within the coverage of a so-called blanket policy or policies of insurance carried and maintained by Tenant or Landlord; provided, that the coverage afforded to Landlord and Tenant will not be reduced or diminished or otherwise be different from that which would exist under a separate policy meeting all other requirements of this Lease by reason of the use of such blanket policy of insurance; and provided further, that the requirements of this Article 9 are otherwise satisfied. 
   
  9.5        Separate Insurance.    Tenant shall not on Tenant s own or pursuant to the request or requirement of any third party, take out separate insurance concurrent in form or contributing in the event of loss with that required in this Article 9 to be furnished, or increase the amount of any then existing insurance by securing an additional policy or additional policies, unless all parties having an insurable interest in the subject matter of the insurance, including, without limitation, and in all cases, Landlord, are each included therein as an additional insured, and the loss is payable under such additional separate insurance in the same manner as losses are payable under this Lease. Tenant shall immediately provide Notice to Landlord that Tenant has obtained any such separate insurance or of the increasing of any of the amounts of the then existing insurance. 
   
  9.6        Reports on Insurance Claims.    Tenant shall promptly investigate and make a complete and timely written report to the appropriate insurance company as to all accidents, claims for damage relating to the ownership, operation, and maintenance of any Hotel, any damage or destruction to any Hotel, and the estimated cost of repair thereof, and shall prepare any and all reports required by any insurance company in connection therewith. All such reports shall be timely filed with the insurance company as required under the terms of the insurance policy involved, and a final copy of such report shall be furnished to Landlord. 
   
  9.7        Indemnification of Landlord.    Except as expressly provided herein, Tenant shall protect, indemnify, and hold harmless Landlord for, from, and against all liabilities, obligations, claims, damages, penalties, causes of action, costs, and reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys  fees), to the maximum extent permitted by law, imposed upon or incurred by or asserted against Landlord by reason of: (a) any accident, injury to, or death of persons, or loss of or damage to property of third parties, occurring during the Term on or about the Leased Property or adjoining sidewalks or rights of way under Tenant s control, and (b) any use, misuse, condition, management, maintenance, or repair by Tenant or anyone claiming under Tenant of the Leased Property or Tenant s Personal Property during the Term, or any litigation, proceeding, or claim by governmental entities to which Landlord is made a party or participant relating to such use, misuse, condition, management, maintenance, or repair; provided, that Tenant s obligations hereunder shall not apply to any liability, obligation, claim, damage, penalty, cause of action, cost, or expense arising from any gross negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord, its employees, agents, contractors, or invitees. Tenant, at its expense, shall defend any such claim, action, or proceeding asserted or instituted against Landlord covered under this indemnity (and shall not be responsible for any duplicative attorneys  fees incurred by Landlord) or may compromise or otherwise dispose of the same. The obligations of Tenant under this Section 9.7 shall survive the termination of this Lease for a period of one year. 
   
  Article 10.          DAMAGE, REPAIR, AND CONDEMNATION 
   
  10.1        Damage and Repair.     
  (a)        If, during the Term, a Hotel suffers a Total Casualty, then Landlord shall, at its cost and expense and with all reasonable diligence, repair and/or replace the damaged portion of such Hotel to the same condition as existed previously. Such damage or destruction shall not terminate this Lease. Notwithstanding any provisions of this Article 10 to the contrary, if a Hotel suffers a Total Casualty during the last 24 months of the Term, then either of Landlord and Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease with respect to such Hotel by giving Notice to the other within 30 days after the date of damage or destruction, whereupon all accrued Rent with respect to such Hotel shall be paid immediately, this Lease shall automatically terminate with respect to such Hotel five (5) days after the date of such Notice and, upon such termination, Minimum Rent payable hereunder shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Minimum Rent allocated to the applicable Hotel set forth in Exhibit A and the Thresholds shall be reduced by the applicable Threshold Allocation.    Threshold Allocation    means (only for purposes of this Article 10), with respect to any applicable Hotel and as applied to the Thresholds, an amount calculated by multiplying the Thresholds by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Minimum Rent allocated to the applicable Hotel as set forth in Exhibit A, and the denominator of which is the aggregate Minimum Rent for all of the Hotels as set forth in Exhibit A. 
  (b)        If, during the Term, a Hotel is damaged by fire, casualty, or other cause to a greater extent than a Minor Casualty, but not to the extent of a Total Casualty, then Landlord shall, at its cost and expense and with all reasonable diligence, repair and/or replace the damaged portion of such Hotel to the same condition as existed previously. Tenant shall have the right to discontinue operating, or cause the Management Parties to discontinue operating, the Hotel to the extent Tenant deems necessary to comply with applicable Legal Requirements or as necessary for the safe and orderly operation of such Hotel. To the extent available, proceeds from the insurance described in Section 9.1 of this Lease shall be applied to such repairs and/or replacements. The parties agree that Landlord s obligations to repair and/or replace pursuant to the provisions of this Section 10.1(c) shall be limited to the extent of available insurance proceeds (plus the amount of any applicable deductibles). The parties further agree that if Landlord is obligated to utilize such available insurance proceeds to repay any obligations pursuant to any Mortgage, then Landlord shall be entitled to an equitable extension of time (in which Landlord has to fulfill its obligations pursuant to the provisions of this Section 10.1(c)) that is sufficient to allow Landlord to obtain the necessary funding to replace such spent insurance proceeds and to make the repairs and/or replacements required hereunder. The parties further agree that Landlord s obligations to repair and/or replace pursuant to the provisions of this Section 10.1(c) shall be subject to Landlord s ability to obtain such entitlements and/or other governmental approvals as may be necessary to undertake such repair and/or replacement; provided, that Landlord shall undertake good faith efforts to obtain such entitlements and/or approvals. 
  (c)        All insurance proceeds payable by reason of any loss of or damage to any of Tenant s Personal Property shall be paid to Tenant, and, to the extent necessary to repair or replace Tenant s Personal Property in accordance with this Section 10.1(d), Tenant shall hold such proceeds to pay the cost of repairing or replacing damaged Tenant s Personal Property and, if this Lease terminates, pay the same over to Landlord. If Landlord undertakes to restore the Leased Property as hereinabove provided, then Tenant shall either (i) restore all of Tenant s Personal Property, if any, or (ii) replace Tenant s Personal Property, if any, with items of the same or better quality and utility to the operation of the Leased Property. 
   
  10.2        Condemnation.     
  (a)        In the event a portion of a Hotel shall be taken by the events described in Section 10.2(a), or an entire Hotel is affected but on a temporary basis, and the result is not to make it unreasonable to continue to operate such Hotel, this Lease shall not terminate, but the Rent due hereunder shall be equitably abated taking into consideration, among other relevant factors, the number of useable rooms, the amount of square footage, or revenues affected or taken by such events. However, so much of any Award for any such partial taking or condemnation as shall be necessary to render the Hotel equivalent to its condition prior to such event shall be used for such purpose and Tenant shall have the right to discontinue operating, or to cause the Management Parties to discontinue operating, the Hotel or portion of the Hotel to the extent it deems necessary for the safe and orderly operation of the Hotel. 
   
  Article 11.          CC Rs, LIENS, ETC. 
   
  11.1        No Covenants, Conditions, or Restrictions.     
  (a)        Tenant shall cause the Management Parties to manage and operate the Hotels in compliance with all obligations imposed on Landlord or the Hotels pursuant to any CC Rs to the extent (i) such obligations are known to the Management Parties (ii) such CC Rs relate to the management and operation of the Hotels and (iii) the CC Rs are not inconsistent with the Management Agreement. 
   
  11.2        Liens; Credit.    Tenant shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent any liens from being filed against the Hotels which arise from any maintenance, repairs, alterations, improvements, renewals, or replacements in or to the Hotels, and shall cooperate fully in obtaining the release of any such liens. 
   
  11.3        Amendments Requested by Mortgagee.    If requested by any Mortgagee or prospective Mortgagee, Tenant agrees to execute and deliver any amendment of this Lease that is reasonably required by such Mortgagee or prospective Mortgagee; provided, that Tenant shall be under no obligation to amend this Lease if the result of such amendment would be to materially and adversely increase Tenant s obligations or to materially and adversely affect Tenant s rights under this Lease or to amend Article 5. Any such amendment shall be in effect only for the period of time in which such Mortgage is outstanding. 
   
  Article 12.          DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES 
   
  12.1        Events of Default.    The occurrence of any one or more of the following events shall constitute an    Event of Default    hereunder: 
  (a)        should Tenant fail to make any payment of Minimum Rent or Percentage Rent within 5 Business Days after Notice thereof, or fail to make payment of any other Rent or any other sum payable hereunder when due and such failure shall continue for a period of 30 days after Notice thereof; 
  (b)        should Tenant fail to maintain the insurance coverages required under Article 9 and such failure shall continue for 10 Business Days after Notice thereof; 
  (c)        subject to Article 8 relating to permitted contests, should Tenant default in the due observance or performance of any of the terms, covenants, or agreements contained herein to be performed or observed by it (other than as specified in clauses (a) and (b) above) and such default shall continue for a period of 30 days after Notice thereof from Landlord to Tenant; provided, that if such default is susceptible of cure but such cure cannot be accomplished with due diligence within such period of time, and if, in addition, Tenant commences to cure or cause to be cured such default within 30 days after Notice thereof from Landlord and thereafter prosecutes the curing of such default with all due diligence, then such period of time shall be extended to such period of time (not to exceed 90 days) as may be necessary to cure such default with all due diligence; 
  (d)        should Tenant generally not be paying its debts as they become due or should Tenant make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; 
  (e)        should any petition be filed by or against Tenant under the relevant bankruptcy laws, or should any other proceeding be instituted by or against Tenant seeking to adjudicate it a bankrupt or insolvent, or seeking liquidation, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, or composition of it or its debts under any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization or relief of debtors, or seeking the entry of an order for relief or the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, or other similar official for Tenant or for any substantial part of the property of Tenant and such proceeding is not dismissed within 60 days after institution thereof, or should Tenant take any action to authorize any of the actions set forth above in this paragraph; 
  (f)        should Tenant cause or institute any proceeding for its dissolution or termination; 
  (g)        unless Tenant shall be contesting such lien or attachment in good faith in accordance with Article 8, should the estate or interest of Tenant in the Leased Property or any part thereof be levied upon or attached in any proceeding and the same shall not be vacated, discharged, or fully bonded or otherwise secured to the reasonable satisfaction of Landlord within the later of (i) 60 days after such attachment or levy, unless the amount in dispute is less than C$100,000.00 (as adjusted each year by increases or decreases in the Index), in which case Tenant shall give notice to Landlord of the dispute but Tenant may defend in any suitable way, and (ii) 30 days after receipt by Tenant of Notice thereof from Landlord; it being understood and agreed that Tenant may commence a contest of such matter pursuant to Article 8 above following such Notice from Landlord; or 
  (h)        should Tenant be in default under the Management Agreement beyond any applicable cure period, 
  then, and in any such event, Landlord, in addition to all other remedies available to it, may terminate this Lease by giving Notice thereof to Tenant and upon the expiration of the time fixed in such Notice, this Lease shall terminate and all rights of Tenant under this Lease shall cease. Landlord shall have and may exercise all rights and remedies available at law and in equity to Landlord as a result of Tenant s breach of this Lease, including, without limitation, the right of re-entry upon the Leased Property upon and at any time after the occurrence of an Event of Default. 
   
  12.2        Damages.    Neither the termination of this Lease, the repossession of the Leased Property, the failure of Landlord to relet the Leased Property, nor the reletting of all or any portion thereof shall relieve Tenant of its liability and obligations hereunder, all of which shall survive any such termination, repossession, or reletting to the maximum extent permitted by law. In the event of any such termination, Tenant shall forthwith pay to Landlord all Rent due and payable with respect to the Leased Property to and including the date of such termination. In addition, Tenant shall forthwith pay to Landlord, at Landlord s option, as and for liquidated and agreed current damages for Tenant s default, either: 
  (a)        Without termination of Tenant s rights to possession of the Leased Property, each installment of Rent (including Default Rent as determined below) and other sums payable to Tenant by Landlord under this Lease as the same becomes due and payable, which Rent and other sums shall bear interest at the Interest Rate from the date due until paid or otherwise discharged, and Landlord may enforce, by action or otherwise, any other term or covenant of this Lease; or 
  (b)        the sum of: 
  (i)        the unpaid Rent which had been earned at the time of termination, repossession, or reletting, and 
  (ii)        the worth at the time of termination, repossession, or reletting of the amount by which the unpaid Rent for the balance of the Term after the time of termination, repossession, or reletting, exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves could be reasonably avoided and as reduced for rentals received after the time of termination, repossession, or reletting, if and to the extent required by applicable law (the  worth at the time of termination, repossession, or reletting  of the amount referred to in this subparagraph (ii) is computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at the time of award plus 1%), and 
  (iii)        any other amount necessary to compensate Landlord for all the detriment proximately caused by Tenant s failure to perform its obligations under this Lease or which, in the ordinary course, would be likely to result therefrom. 
     Default Rent    for the purposes of this Section 12.2 shall be a sum equal to (A) the average of the annual amounts of the Percentage Rent for the three Fiscal Years immediately preceding the Fiscal Year in which the termination, re-entry, or repossession takes place, or (B) if three Fiscal Years shall not have elapsed, the average of the Percentage Rent during the preceding Fiscal Years during which this Lease was in effect, or (C) if one Fiscal Year has not elapsed, the amount derived by annualizing the Percentage Rent from the Commencement Date. 
   
  12.3        Waiver of Jury Trial.    Landlord and Tenant hereby waive, to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Laws, trial by jury in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim brought by any of the parties hereto against the other or in respect of any matter whatsoever arising out of or in any way connected with this Lease, the relationship of Landlord and Tenant hereunder, Tenant s occupancy of the Leased Property, and/or any claim for injury or damage. 
   
  12.4        Application of Funds.    Any payments received by Landlord under any of the provisions of this Lease during the existence or continuance of any Event of Default (and any payment made to Landlord rather than Tenant due to the existence of any Event of Default) shall be applied to Tenant s current and past due obligations under this Lease in such order as Landlord may determine or as may be required by Applicable Laws. 
   
  12.5        Landlord s Right to Cure Tenant s Default.    If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, then Landlord, after Notice to Tenant with a courtesy copy to the Management Parties (which Notice shall not be required if Landlord shall reasonably determine immediate action is necessary to protect person or property), without waiving or releasing any obligation of Tenant and without waiving or releasing any Event of Default, may (but shall not be obligated to), at any time thereafter, make such payment or perform such act for the account and at the expense of Tenant, and may, to the maximum extent permitted by law, enter upon the Leased Property or any portion thereof for such purpose and take all such action thereon as, in Landlord s sole and absolute discretion, may be necessary or appropriate therefor. No such entry shall be deemed an eviction of Tenant. All reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys  fees) incurred by Landlord in connection therewith, together with interest thereon (to the extent permitted by law) at the Interest Rate from the date such sums are paid by Landlord until repaid, shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord, on demand. 
   
  12.6        Good Faith Dispute.    If Tenant shall in good faith dispute the occurrence of any Default, then Tenant, before the expiration of the applicable cure period, shall give Notice thereof to Landlord, setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor and (provided Tenant shall escrow disputed amounts, if any, pursuant to an escrow arrangement reasonably acceptable to Landlord and Tenant) no Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred; provided, that in the event of any eventual adverse determination, Tenant shall pay to Landlord interest on any disputed funds at the Interest Rate, from the date demand for such funds was made by Landlord until the date of final adverse determination and, thereafter, at the Interest Rate until paid. 
   
  Article 13.          HOLDING OVER 
  Any holding over by Tenant after the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease shall be treated as a weekly tenancy at sufferance at a rate equal to twice the Rent and other charges herein provided (prorated on a daily basis). Tenant shall also pay to Landlord all damages (direct or indirect) sustained by reason of any such holding over. Otherwise, such holding over shall be on the terms and conditions set forth in this Lease, to the extent applicable. Nothing contained herein shall constitute the consent, express, or implied, of Landlord to the holding over of Tenant after the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease. 
   
  Article 14.          LANDLORD S NOTICE OBLIGATIONS; LANDLORD S DEFAULT 
   
  14.1        Landlord s Notice Obligation.    Landlord shall give prompt Notice to Tenant and the Management Parties of any materially adverse matters affecting the Leased Property of which Landlord receives written notice or actual, conscious, present knowledge, and, to the extent Tenant and/or the Management Parties otherwise has no notice or actual knowledge thereof, Landlord shall be liable for any liabilities, costs, damages, or claims (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys  fees) arising from the failure to deliver such Notice to Tenant. As used in this Lease,  Landlord s knowledge  or words of similar import shall mean the actual (and not constructive or imputed), conscious, present knowledge, without independent investigation or inquiry of William D. Rahm, Vivek Melwani, A.J. Agarwal, Tyler Henritze, Michael Barr, and Daniel Kamensky. 
   
  14.2        Landlord s Default.     
  (a)        If Landlord shall in good faith dispute the occurrence of a Landlord Default and Landlord, before the expiration of the applicable cure period, shall give Notice thereof to Tenant setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor, then no Landlord Default shall be deemed to have occurred and Landlord shall have no obligation with respect thereto until final adverse determination thereof, whether through arbitration or otherwise; provided, that in the event of any such adverse determination, Landlord shall pay to Tenant interest on any disputed funds at the Interest Rate, from the date demand for such funds was made by Tenant until the date of final adverse determination and, thereafter, at the Interest Rate until paid. If Tenant and Landlord shall fail, in good faith, to resolve any such dispute within 30 days after Landlord s Notice of dispute, then either may submit the matter for determination by arbitration, but only if such matter is required to be submitted to arbitration pursuant to any provision of this Lease, or otherwise by a court of competent jurisdiction. 
   
  14.3        Tenant s Right to Cure.    Subject to the provisions of Section 14.2, if Landlord breaches any covenant to be performed by it under this Lease, then Tenant after Notice to and demand upon Landlord as provided in Section 14.2, without waiving or releasing any obligation hereunder, may (but shall be under no obligation at any time thereafter to) make such payment or perform such act for the account and at the expense of Landlord. All sums so paid by Tenant and all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys  fees) so incurred, together with interest thereon at the Interest Rate from the date on which such sums or expenses are paid or incurred by Tenant, shall be paid by Landlord, to Tenant on demand. The rights of Tenant hereunder to cure and to secure payment from Landlord in accordance with this Section 14.3 shall survive the termination of this Lease with respect to the Leased Property. 
   
  Article 15.          TRANSFERS BY LANDLORD 
  Tenant acknowledges and agrees that Landlord has the unrestricted right to mortgage, encumber, convey and assign its interest in the Leased Property.  Tenant agrees and acknowledges that, at the request of Landlord and in consideration for the granting of the Leased Property to Tenant, Tenant shall enter into and execute certain documents, agreements or instruments to mortgage, encumber, convey and assign its interest in the Leased Property to further secure any financing obtained by Landlord.  If Landlord conveys the Leased Property in accordance with the terms hereof to a Mortgagee, or to a grantee or transferee that expressly assumes in writing all obligations of Landlord hereunder arising or accruing from and after the date of such conveyance or transfer, then Landlord shall thereupon be released from all future liabilities and obligations of Landlord under this Lease arising or accruing from and after the date of such conveyance or other transfer as to the Leased Property and all such future liabilities and obligations shall thereupon be binding upon the new owner.  
   
  Article 16.          SUBLETTING AND ASSIGNMENT 
   
  16.1        Subletting and Assignment.     
  (a)        If this Lease is assigned or if the Leased Property or any part thereof is sublet (or occupied by anybody other than Tenant hereunder), then Landlord may collect the rents from such assignee, subtenant, or occupant, as the case may be, and apply the net amount collected to the Rent herein reserved, but no such collection shall be deemed a waiver of the provisions set forth in the first paragraph of  Section 16.1, the acceptance by Landlord of such assignee, subtenant, or occupant, as the case may be, as a tenant, or a release of Tenant from the future performance by Tenant of its covenants, agreements, or obligations contained in this Lease. 
  (b)        No subletting or assignment shall in any way impair the continuing primary liability of Tenant hereunder (unless Landlord and Tenant expressly otherwise agree that Tenant shall be released from all obligations hereunder), and no consent to any subletting or assignment in a particular instance shall be deemed to be a waiver of the prohibition set forth in Section 16.1. No assignment, subletting, or occupancy shall affect any Permitted Use. Any subletting, assignment, or other transfer of Tenant s interest under this Lease in contravention of Section 16.1 shall be voidable at Landlord s option. 
   
  16.2        Required Sublease Provisions.    Any sublease of any portion of the Leased Property entered into on or after the date hereof shall provide (a) that it is subject and subordinate to this Lease and to the matters to which this Lease is or shall be subject or subordinate; (b) that in the event of termination of this Lease or reentry or dispossession of Tenant by Landlord under this Lease, Landlord may, at its option, terminate such sublease or take over all of the right, title, and interest of Tenant, as sublessor under such sublease, and, except as provided below, such subtenant shall, at Landlord s option, attorn to Landlord pursuant to the then executory provisions of such sublease, except that neither Landlord nor any Mortgagee, as holder of a mortgage or as Landlord under this Lease, if such Mortgagee succeeds to that position, shall (i) be liable for any act or omission of Tenant under such sublease, (ii) be subject to any credit, counterclaim, offset, or defense which theretofore accrued to such subtenant against Tenant, (iii) be bound by any previous prepayment of more than one Accounting Period, (iv) be bound by any covenant of Tenant to undertake or complete any construction of the Leased Property or any portion thereof, (v) be required to account for any security deposit of the subtenant other than any security deposit actually delivered to Landlord by Tenant, (vi) be bound by any obligation to make any payment to such subtenant or grant any credits, except for services, repairs, maintenance, and restoration provided for under the sublease that are performed after the date of such attornment; (vii) be responsible for any monies owing by Tenant to the credit of such subtenant, or (viii) be required to remove any Person occupying any portion of the Leased Property; and (c) in the event that such subtenant receives a written Notice from Landlord or any Mortgagee stating that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such subtenant shall thereafter be obligated to pay all rentals accruing under such sublease directly to the party giving such Notice or as such party may direct. All rentals received from such subtenant by Landlord or the Mortgagee, as the case may be, shall be credited against the amounts owing by Tenant under this Lease and such sublease shall provide that the subtenant thereunder shall, at the request of Landlord, execute a suitable instrument in confirmation of such agreement to attorn. An original counterpart of each such sublease duly executed by Tenant and such subtenant shall be delivered promptly to Landlord and Tenant shall remain liable for the payment of the Rent and for the performance and observance of all of the covenants and conditions to be performed by Tenant hereunder. The provisions of this Section 16.2 shall not be deemed a waiver of the provisions set forth in Section 16.1(a). No subtenant that is an Affiliate of Tenant shall be required to attorn to Landlord as set forth above in this Section 16.2. 
   
  16.3        Permitted Sublease and Assignment.    Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to the provisions of Section 16.4 and any other express conditions or limitations set forth herein, Tenant may, without Landlord s consent, sublease space at the Leased Property for any uses ancillary to the Permitted Use, so long as such subleases do not demise, in the aggregate, in excess of 3,000 square feet (exclusive of any parking garage subleases), and will not violate or affect any Legal Requirement or Insurance Requirement. 
   
  16.4        Sublease Limitation.    For so long as Landlord or any Affiliate of Landlord or any Member or beneficiary of Landlord or any direct or indirect constituent owner thereof shall seek to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Code, anything contained in this Lease to the contrary notwithstanding, Tenant shall not sublet the Leased Property on any basis such that the rental to be paid by any sublessee thereunder would be based, in whole or in part, on either (a) the income or profits derived by the business activities of such sublessee or (b) any other formula such that any portion of such sublease rental would fail to qualify as  rents from real property  within the meaning of Section 856(d) of the Code, or any similar or successor provision thereto. 
   
  Article 17.          ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATES AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

At any time and from time to time, upon not less than 10 Business Days prior Notice by either party, the party receiving such Notice shall furnish to the other a certificate certifying that this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect (or that this Lease is in full force and effect as modified and setting forth the modifications), the date to which the Rent has been paid, that to its knowledge no Default or an Event of Default by the other party has occurred and is continuing or, if a Default or an Event of Default shall exist, specifying in reasonable detail the nature thereof, and the steps being taken to remedy the same, and such additional information as the requesting party may reasonably request. If such additional information reasonably requires more than 10 Business Days to provide, then the party furnishing such information shall be entitled to such additional period to respond to such request as may be reasonably required under the circumstances. Any such certificate furnished pursuant to this Section 17.1 may be relied upon by the requesting party, its lenders, and any prospective purchaser or mortgagee of the Leased Property or the leasehold estate created hereby. 
   
  17.2        Accounting and Annual Reconciliation.     
  (a)        Within 120 days after the end of each Fiscal Year (or such earlier time period as required under the Management Agreement), Tenant shall cause the Management Parties to deliver to Tenant and Landlord a statement (the    Annual Operating Statement   ) in reasonable detail summarizing the operations of the Hotels for the immediately preceding Fiscal Year, audited and certified by a nationally recognized firm of certified public accountants having hotel accounting experience as described in the Management Agreement. Landlord and Tenant shall promptly after Landlord s receipt of such Annual Operating Statement, make any adjustments, by cash payment, in the amounts paid or retained for such Fiscal Year as are needed because of the final figures set forth in such Annual Operating Statement as reconciled by the Management Parties and/or Tenant to the Accounting Period Statements. Such Annual Operating Statement shall be controlling over the preceding Accounting Period Statements. 
   
  17.3        Books and Records.    Books of control and account pertaining to operations at the Hotels shall be kept by Tenant, or by the Management Parties on behalf of Tenant, on the accrual basis and in all material respects in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts and GAAP. Tenant, upon Landlord s reasonable request and at reasonable intervals during the Management Parties  normal business hours, shall examine such records to seek to obtain such information therefrom as reasonably directed by Landlord.

  Article 18.          LANDLORD S RIGHT TO INSPECT 
  The parties acknowledge that Landlord is a direct or indirect controlled subsidiary of an entity, Extended Stay America, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the    REOC Parent   ), that is intended to qualify as a  real estate operating company  (a    REOC   ) within the meaning of the U.S. Department of Labor plan assets regulation (Section 2510.3-101, Part 2510 of Chapter XXV, Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations) and that it is intended that Landlord will have the rights, pursuant to this Lease, as would be reasonably necessary to result in the qualification of REOC Parent as a REOC. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, notwithstanding any other provision of this Lease, without prejudice to the other rights provided to Landlord under this Lease, Tenant agrees to: (a) permit Landlord and REOC Parent to visit and inspect the Leased Property, to make such repairs as Landlord is permitted or required to make pursuant to the terms of this Lease, and inspect and copy the books and records of Tenant, at such times as Landlord shall reasonably request; provided, that any inspection or repair by Landlord and REOC Parent or their representatives will not unreasonably interfere with Tenant s or the Management Parties  use and operation of the Leased Property; (b) periodically (at least quarterly) provide Landlord and REOC Parent with information and reports regarding Tenant s or the Management Parties  operation and management of the Leased Property and the performance of its duties under this Lease and with respect to renovations, alterations, general maintenance, repairs, and development activities that Tenant has engaged in or intends to engage in with respect to the Leased Property and its surroundings; (c) periodically (at least quarterly) consult with Landlord and REOC Parent in advance with respect to any right retained under this Lease and with respect to Tenant s operation and management of the Leased Property, as appropriate, and the performance of Tenant s duties under this Lease including, without limitation, with respect to matters relating to renovations, alterations, general maintenance, repairs, and development activities with respect to the Leased Property and its surroundings; and (d) to provide Landlord and REOC Parent with such other rights as may reasonably be determined by Landlord to be necessary to enable REOC Parent to qualify as a REOC; provided, that such additional rights do not materially adversely affect (A) Tenant s ability to perform its duties under this Lease or the economic benefits enjoyed by Tenant under this Lease or (B) the status of ESH Hospitality as a real estate investment trust under the Code. Tenant agrees to consider, in good faith, the recommendations of Landlord in connection with the matters on which it is consulted as described above. 
   
  Article 19.          INTENTIONALLY OMITTED 
   
  Article 20.          LIMITATIONS 
   
  20.1        REIT Compliance.    Landlord is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of ESH Hospitality. Tenant acknowledges that ESH Hospitality intends to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Code. Tenant agrees that it will not knowingly or intentionally take or omit to take any action, or permit any status or condition to exist at the Leased Property, which Tenant actually knows (acting in good faith) would or could result in (a) the Rent payable under this Lease not qualifying as  rents from real property  as defined in Section 856(d) of the Code or (b) ESH Hospitality being disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust under the Code as the provisions exist on the date hereof; provided, that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (A) Tenant shall not be responsible for any act or omission of Landlord or the Management Parties (unless the Management Parties  action was with the express written consent, or at the direction, of Tenant), and (B) any action by Tenant taken in compliance with the express terms of this Lease or the Management Agreement shall not be deemed to create a Default or Event of Default under this Section 20.1.  
   
  20.2        Sublease Rent Limitation.    Anything contained in this Lease to the contrary notwithstanding, from and after the Commencement Date, Tenant shall not knowingly or intentionally (acting in good faith) enter into any sublease with respect to the Leased Property or any part thereof on any basis such that the rental to be paid by the sublessee thereunder would be based (or considered to be based), in whole or in part, on either (a) the income or profits derived by the business activities of the sublessee, or (b) any other formula such that any portion of the rent payable hereunder would or could, to Tenant s actual knowledge (acting in good faith), fail to qualify as  rents from real property  within the meaning of Section 856(d) of the Code, or any similar or successor provisions thereto. 
   
  Article 21.          MISCELLANEOUS 
   
  21.1        No Waiver.    No failure by Landlord or Tenant to insist upon the strict performance of any term hereof or to exercise any right, power, or remedy consequent upon a breach thereof, and no acceptance of full or partial payment of Rent during the continuance of any such breach, shall constitute a waiver of any such breach or of any such term. To the maximum extent permitted by law, no waiver of any breach shall affect or alter this Lease, which shall continue in full force and effect with respect to any other then existing or subsequent breach. 
   
  21.2        Remedies Cumulative.    To the maximum extent permitted, by law, each legal, equitable, or contractual right, power, and remedy of Landlord or Tenant, now or hereafter provided either in this Lease or by statute or otherwise, shall be cumulative and concurrent and shall be in addition to every other right, power, and remedy and the exercise or beginning of the exercise by Landlord or Tenant (as applicable) of any one or more of such rights, powers, and remedies shall not preclude the simultaneous or subsequent exercise by Landlord of any or all of such other rights, powers, and remedies. 
   
  21.3        Severability.    Any clause, sentence, paragraph, section, or provision of this Lease held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or ineffective shall not impair, invalidate, or nullify the remainder of this Lease, but rather the effect thereof shall be confined to the clause, sentence, paragraph, section, or provision so held to be invalid, illegal, or ineffective, and this Lease shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal, or ineffective provisions had never been contained herein. 
   
  21.4        Acceptance of Surrender.    No surrender to Landlord of this Lease or of the Leased Property or any part thereof, or of any interest therein, shall be valid or effective unless agreed to and accepted in writing by Landlord and no act by Landlord or any representative or agent of Landlord, other than such a written acceptance by Landlord, shall constitute an acceptance of any such surrender. 
   
  21.5        No Merger of Title.    It is expressly acknowledged and agreed that it is the intent of the parties that there shall be no merger of this Lease or of the leasehold estate created hereby by reason of the fact that the same Person may acquire, own, or hold, directly or indirectly, this Lease or the leasehold estate created hereby and the fee estate or ground landlord s interest in the Leased Property. 
   
  21.6        Conveyance by Landlord.    If Landlord or any successor owner of all or any portion of the Leased Property shall convey all or any portion of the Leased Property in accordance with the terms of this Lease other than as security for a debt, and the grantee or transferee of such of the Leased Property shall expressly assume all obligations of Landlord hereunder with respect to such of the Leased Property arising or accruing from and after the date of such conveyance or transfer, then Landlord or such successor owner, as the case may be, shall thereupon be released from all future liabilities and obligations of Landlord under this Lease with respect to such of the Leased Property arising or accruing from and after the date of such conveyance or other transfer and all such future liabilities and obligations shall thereupon be binding upon the new owner. 
   
  21.7        Quiet Enjoyment.    Provided that no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Tenant shall peaceably and quietly have, hold, and enjoy the Leased Property for the Term, free of hindrance or molestation by Landlord or anyone claiming by, through, or under Landlord, but subject to (a) any encumbrance permitted to be created by Landlord hereunder, (b) liens as to obligations of Landlord that are either not yet due or which are being contested in good faith and by proper proceedings; provided, that the same do not materially interfere with Tenant s or the Management Parties  ability to operate the Hotels, and (c) liens that have been consented to in writing by Tenant. Except as otherwise provided in this Lease, no failure by Landlord to comply with the foregoing covenant shall give Tenant the right to cancel or terminate this Lease or abate, reduce, or make a deduction from or offset against the Rent or any other sum payable under this Lease ,or to fail to perform any other obligation of Tenant hereunder. 
   
  21.8        Registration.    Neither Tenant nor anyone on Tenant s behalf or claiming under Tenant shall register this Lease or any assignment or sublease against the Leased Property.

Upon the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, Tenant shall promptly discharge or otherwise vacate any such notice or caveat.

  21.10        Notices.     
  (a)        All notices required or permitted to be sent hereunder shall be deemed to have been given for all purposes of this Lease upon the date of receipt or refusal, except that whenever under this Lease a notice is either received on a day which is not a Business Day or is required to be delivered on or before a specific day which is not a Business Day, the day of receipt or required delivery shall automatically be extended to the next Business Day.

  21.11        Construction; Nonrecourse.    Neither this Lease nor any provision hereof may be changed, waived, discharged, or terminated except by an instrument in writing signed by all the parties thereto. All the terms and provisions of this Lease shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns. Each term or provision of this Lease to be performed by Tenant shall be construed as an independent covenant and condition. Time is of the essence with respect to the exercise of any rights of Tenant or Landlord under this Lease. In the event of any dispute between the parties concerning this Lease, Landlord shall be entitled to an award of attorney s fees and costs in connection with such dispute, including, without limitation, in connection with any suit, action, arbitration, or other proceeding concerning such dispute. Except as otherwise set forth in this Lease, any obligations arising prior to the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease of Tenant (including, without limitation, any monetary, repair, and indemnification obligations) and Landlord shall survive the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease; provided, that each of Landlord and Tenant shall be required to give the other Notice of any such surviving and unsatisfied obligations within one year after the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease. Nothing contained in this Lease shall be construed to create or impose any liabilities or obligations and no such liabilities or obligations shall be imposed on any of the shareholders, beneficial owners, direct or indirect, officers, directors, trustees, employees, or agents of Landlord or Tenant for the payment or performance of the obligations or liabilities of Landlord or Tenant hereunder. Further, in the event Landlord shall be in default under this Lease, and if as a consequence of such default, Tenant shall recover a money judgment against Landlord, then such judgment shall be satisfied only out of the proceeds of sale received upon execution of such judgment against the right, title, and interest of Landlord in the Leased Property. 
   
  21.12        Counterparts; Headings.    This Lease may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but which, when taken together, shall constitute but one instrument and shall become effective as of the date hereof when copies hereof, which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the parties hereto shall have been signed. Headings in this Lease are for purposes of reference only and shall not limit or affect the meaning of the provisions hereof. 
   
  21.13        Applicable Law.    This Lease shall be interpreted, construed, applied, and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York; provided, that the provisions for the enforcement of Landlord s rights and remedies hereunder shall be governed by the laws of each of the respective jurisdictions where the Leased Property is located to the extent necessary for the validity and enforcement thereof. 
   
  21.14        Right to Make Agreement.    Each party warrants, with respect to itself, that neither the execution of this Lease, nor the consummation of any transaction contemplated hereby, shall violate any provision of any law, or any judgment, writ, injunction, order, or decree of any court or governmental authority having jurisdiction over it; nor result in or constitute a breach or default under any indenture, contract, or other commitment or restriction to which it is a party or by which it is bound; nor require any consent, vote, or approval which has not been given or taken, or at the time of the transaction involved shall not have been given or taken. Each party covenants that it has and will continue to have, throughout the term of this Lease and any extensions thereof, the full right to enter into this Lease and perform its obligations hereunder. 
   
  21.15        Disclosure of Information.     
  (a)        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing provisions of this Section 21.15 or elsewhere in this Lease, any party (and any employee, representative, or other agent of any party) may disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated by this Lease and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to any party relating to such tax treatment and tax structure; provided, that any such information and materials shall be kept confidential to the extent necessary to comply with any applicable securities laws. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated by this Lease shall not be deemed to include the identity of the parties, the location of the Leased Property, or the amount of Rent payable by Tenant hereunder. The foregoing authorization of disclosure is retroactively effective immediately upon commencement of the first discussions among the parties regarding the transactions contemplated hereby, and the parties aver and affirm that this tax disclosure authorization has been given on a date which is no later than 30 days from the first day that any party (or any employee, representative, or other agent of a party) first made or provided a statement as to the potential federal income tax consequences that may result from the transactions contemplated hereby. 
  (b)        The obligations of Tenant and Landlord contained in this Section 21.15 shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease. 
   
  21.16        Operating Lease.    The parties hereto intend that this Lease shall be deemed for all purposes to be an operating lease and not a capital lease. 
   
  21.17        No Joint Venture or Partnership.    Landlord and Tenant intend that the relationship created hereunder be solely that of landlord and tenant. Nothing herein is intended to create a joint venture, partnership, tenancy-in-common, or joint tenancy relationship between Landlord and Tenant. 
   
  21.18        Planning Act (Ontario).    It is an express condition of this Lease that the subdivision control provisions of the applicable provincial legislation be complied with, if necessary. If such compliance is necessary, then Tenant covenants and agrees to proceed diligently, at Tenant s expense, to obtain the required consent and Landlord agrees to cooperate, at Tenant s expense, with Tenant in bringing such application. 
   
  21.19        Distress.    Notwithstanding any provision of this Lease or any provision of any applicable legislation, none of the goods and chattels of Tenant on the Leased Property at any time during the Term shall be exempt from levy by distress for Rent in arrears, and Tenant waives any such exemption. If Landlord makes any claim against the goods and chattels of Tenant by way of distress, this provision may be pleaded as an estoppel against Tenant in any action brought to test the right of Landlord to levy such distress. 
   
  21.20        Beneficial Owner Ratification.    Beneficial Owner ratifies and confirms that it has irrevocably authorized and directed Landlord to execute and deliver this Lease and that such authorization and direction shall constitute Beneficial Owner s giving of full and sufficient authority to Landlord for Landlord to execute and deliver this Lease. Landlord and Beneficial Owner acknowledge that Tenant is relying on such authorization and direction and that Tenant shall not be obliged to look further into the terms of the trust between Landlord and Beneficial Owner. 
   
  21.21        Amendment and Restatement.    The parties agree that the Original Lease Agreement is hereby amended and restated.  The parties agree that (i) the terms and conditions of the Original Lease Agreement shall be amended as set forth herein and, as so amended, shall be restated in their entirety, but shall be amended only with respect to the rights, title, estates, interest, liabilities, duties, covenants, obligations and agreements among the parties accruing from and after the date hereof.  The execution, delivery and effectiveness of this Lease shall not constitute a waiver of any covenant, agreement or obligation under the Original Lease Agreement, except to the extent that any such covenant, agreement or obligation is no longer set forth herein or is modified hereby.

  SECTION 13(r) DISCLOSURE 
    
  As of the date Extended Stay America, Inc. and ESH Hospitality, Inc. filed their combined quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ), neither The Blackstone Group L.P. ( Blackstone ) nor Travelport Worldwide Limited nor NCR Corporation had filed its Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016. The disclosure with respect to the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016 reproduced below was included in Travelport Worldwide Limited s quarterly report on Form 10-Q and NCR Corporation s quarterly report on Form 10-Q, each filed with the SEC in accordance with Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Each of Travelport Worldwide Limited and NCR Corporation may be considered an affiliate of Blackstone, and therefore an affiliate of Extended Stay America, Inc. and ESH Hospitality, Inc. We did not independently verify or participate in the preparation of these disclosures.  
    
  Travelport Worldwide Limited included the following disclosure in its Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016:  
    
  Trade Sanctions Disclosure  
    
  The following activities are disclosed as required by Section 13(r)(1)(D)(iii) of the Exchange Act.  
    
  As part of our global business in the travel industry, we provide certain passenger travel related Travel Commerce Platform and Technology Services to Iran Air. We also provide certain Technology Services to Iran Air Tours. All of these services are either exempt from applicable sanctions prohibitions pursuant to a statutory exemption permitting transactions ordinarily incident to travel or, to the extent not otherwise exempt, specifically licensed by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. Subject to any changes in the exempt/licensed status of such activities, we intend to continue these business activities, which are directly related to and promote the arrangement of travel for individuals.  
    
  The gross revenue and net profit attributable to these activities in the quarter ended June 30, 2016 were approximately $171,000 and $126,000, respectively. 
    
  NCR Corporation included the following disclosure in its Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016:  
    
  Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r)(1)(D)(iii) of the Securities Exchange Act.   Pursuant to Section 13(r)(1)(D)(iii) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we note that, during the period from April 1, 2016 through April 30, 2016, we continued to maintain a bank account and guarantees at the Commercial Bank of Syria ( CBS ), which was designated as a Specially Designated National pursuant to Executive Order 13382 ( EO 13382 ) on August 10, 2011.  This  

bank account and the guarantees at CBS were maintained in the normal course of business prior to the listing of CBS pursuant to EO 13382.  We note that the last known account balance as of April 30, 2016 was approximately $3,468.  The bank account did not generate interest from April 1, 2016 through April 30, 2016, and the guarantees did not generate any revenue or profits for the Company. Pursuant to a license granted to the Company by OFAC on January 3, 2013, and subsequent licenses granted on April 29, 2013, July 12, 2013, February 28, 2014, November 12, 2014, and October 24, 2015, the Company had been engaged in winding down its past operations in Syria. The Company s last such license expired on April 30, 2016. In addition, the Company s application to renew its license to transact business with CBS, which was submitted to OFAC on May 18, 2015, was not acted upon prior to the expiration of the Company s last such license. As a result, and in connection with the license expiration, the Company abandoned its remaining property in Syria, which, including the CBS account, was commercially insignificant, and ended the employment of its final two employees in Syria, who had remained employed by the Company to assist with the execution of the Company s wind-down activities pursuant to authority granted by the OFAC licenses. The Company does not intend to engage in any further business activities with CBS.
