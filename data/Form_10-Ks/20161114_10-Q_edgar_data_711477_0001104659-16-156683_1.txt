   Forward-Looking Statements   
     
   This Form 10-Q, including specifically the section entitled  Trustee s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  includes  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created thereby. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, included in this Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements. Such statements include, without limitation, certain statements regarding the Trust s financial position, industry conditions and other matters contained in this Form 10-Q. Although the Trustee believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, such expectations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and the Trustee can give no assurance that they will prove correct. There are many factors, none of which is within the Trustee s control, that may cause such expectations not to be realized, including, among other things, factors identified in the Trust s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

   Basis of Presentation   
     
  The accompanying condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and do not necessarily include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of U.S. Bank National Association, as sole trustee of the Trust (the  Trustee ), all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes included in the Trust s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
     
   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
     
   (a)                                      Basis of Accounting:  
     
  The condensed financial statements of the Trust, as prepared on the modified cash basis, reflect the Trust s assets, liabilities, trust corpus, and distributable income as follows:  
     
  1.                                         Royalty income and interest income are recognized in the month in which amounts are received by the Trust. 
     
  2.                                         Trust expenses, consisting principally of routine general and administrative costs, include payments made during the accounting period. 
     
  3.                                         Reserves for liabilities that are contingent or uncertain in amount may also be established if considered necessary. 
     
  4.                                         Net royalty and overriding royalty interests that are producing properties are amortized using the unit-of-production method.  This amortization is shown as a reduction of Trust corpus. 
     
  5.                                         Distributions to Unit Holders are recognized when declared by the Trustee. 
     
  6.                                         Production withholding taxes withheld from Unit Holder distributions and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from royalty income in the condensed statement of distributable income. 
     
  These condensed statements differ from financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and were prepared on the modified cash basis of reporting, which is considered to be the most meaningful because Distributions to Unit Holders are based on net cash receipts.  This comprehensive basis of accounting, other than GAAP, corresponds to the accounting permitted by royalty trusts by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as specified by Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12E,  Financial Statements of Royalty Trusts .  
     
  The condensed financial statements of the Trust differ from financial statements prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) because of the following:  
     
                        Royalty income and interest are recognized in the month received rather than in the month of production. 
     
                        Expenses generally are not accrued.

Table of Contents   
     
                        Amortization of the net royalty and overriding royalty interests is shown as a reduction to Trust corpus and not as a charge to operating results. 
     
                        Reserves may be established for contingencies that would not be recorded under GAAP. 
     
   (b)                                      Cash and Cash Equivalents:  
     
  The Trust considers all highly liquid financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.  
     
   (c)                                       Related Party:  
     
  The Trust was organized to provide an efficient, orderly and practical means of administering the income received from royalty interests and is administered by the Trustee.  Pursuant to the terms of the Trust Indenture, the Trust pays the Trustee $80,000 per year.  The Trustee may adjust this fee annually in its sole discretion.  The Trust pays a Trustee fee of $20,000 per quarter as long as the Trust has sufficient royalty income to make such payments.  
     
  On or about April 26, 2016, the Trust provided written notice to the unit holders that the annual trustee fee will be increasing to $100,000 annually, which will be paid at the rate of $25,000 per quarter.  The first $25,000 quarterly installment will be taken for the quarter ending December 31, 2016, and every quarter thereafter.  In the first nine months of fiscal years 2016 and 2015, the Trust paid an aggregate of $60,000 in Trustee fees, $20,000 for each quarter.  
     
   (d)                                      Subsequent Events:  
     
   On August 16, 2016, the County Court in and for Douglas County, Nebraska (the  Court ) entered an order approving the modification of the Trust s Trust Indenture dated May 17, 1982, and restated on June 10, 1982 (together, the  Trust Agreement ).  The Court approved modifications to the Trust Agreement, which included permitting biannual distributions within ten days after June 30 and December 31 of each year, to the extent funds are available.   Accordingly, the Trust did not pay a distribution for the third quarter of 2016 and instead reserved the amount for distribution at the time of the next distribution, which the Trust anticipates will be in January 2017.  
     
  Other than the modifications to the Trust Agreement, we have evaluated the Trust activity and have concluded that there are no additional material subsequent events requiring additional disclosure or recognition in these condensed financial statements.

   Item 2.  Trustee s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.     
     
   Overview.   
     
  Kiewit Royalty Trust (the  Trust ) is a royalty trust with royalty and overriding royalty interests in certain coal leases.  The Trust was formed for the purposes of administering the income received from such coal leases and distributing such income (together with interest earned thereon, if any, less payment of or provision for obligations) to the holders of the units of beneficial interest.  
     
  During the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, the Trust received a total of $362,846 and $839,706, respectively, of royalty and overriding royalty payments, net of production expenses.  The following tables reflect the royalty and overriding royalty payments, net of production expenses, received by the Trust at the following mines:  

Decker Mine  .  Royalty and overriding royalty amounts received by the Trust from the Decker Mine decreased to $334,686 during the third quarter of 2016, as compared to $382,021 received during the same period in 2015.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, royalty and overriding royalty amounts decreased by $149,765 or 16% to $761,546.  The Decker Mine includes West Decker and East Decker Mine leases.  Of the Decker Mines, the primary producer currently is an East Decker Mine.  The changes during the period were the net result of changes in the relative amounts of coal mined, which was a normal result of the execution of a mining plan encompassing several coal leases, as well as due to top soil covering part of one of the Decker Mines.  The mine operator believes that it is too expensive to move the top soil and further mine the impacted lease, and does not expect to mine this lease in the foreseeable future.  Seasonal fluctuations also occur in the relative amounts of coal mined under the leases with a majority of the royalty payments being received during the first and third calendar quarters of the year. 
     
   Spring Creek Mine  .  The first $50,000 royalty payment from this mine is paid at the end of June or beginning of July each year, and the remaining royalties with respect to this mine are typically paid by the mine operators on an annual basis during the second half of the calendar year.  Royalty and overriding royalty amounts received by the Trust from the Spring Creek Mine decreased to $28,160 during the third quarter of 2016, as compared to $947,276 received during the same period in 2015.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, royalty and overriding royalty amounts received by the Trust from the Spring Creek Mine decreased to $78,160, as compared to $997,276.  These substantial decreases resulted from 
     
 5   

Table of Contents   
     
  an overpayment in royalty amounts of $127,766, which related to prior periods but was deducted from the third quarter amount due to the Trust, as well as from a reduction in the tons of coal produced under the Spring Creek Mine leases.  The operator of the Spring Creek Mine has indicated that it has scaled back production because of the decrease in the coal market and coal prices.  Because of the current market conditions, the operator anticipated 18 million ton capacity but only has approximately 8   10 million ton capacity.  
     
   Interest Income  .  The Trust earns interest on the royalty payments prior to the distribution to the Unit Holders.  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Trust earned a nominal amount of interest. 
     
   Trust Expenses  .  Trust expenses increased slightly to $132,020 for the first nine months of 2016, as compared to $127,043 for the same period in 2015.  Trust expenses included fees of the Trustee, accountants, attorneys, and other professionals that the Trustee employs in the administration of the Trust.  During the three month period ended September 30, 2016, trust expenses were $47,738, compared to $38,937 during the same three month period in 2015.  In the third quarter of 2016, the Trust incurred additional professional expenses for regulatory filings and for the modifications to the Trust Agreement (as further described in Part II, Item 5). 
     
   Liquidity and Capital Resources  .  The Trust s primary source of liquidity is the receipt of royalty payments.  In accordance with the provisions of the Trust Indenture, generally all income received by the Trust, net of Trust expenses and any amounts placed in reserves, is distributed to the Unit Holders twice per year within ten days after June 30 and December 31 as long as the Trust has sufficient income. 
     
   Trust Reserves  .  During the quarter ended September 30, 2015, the Trust did not establish any reserves and did not distribute funds from any reserve.  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Trust established a reserve in the amount of $315,111, in accordance with the recent modifications to the Trust Agreement.  Accordingly, the Trust did not pay a distribution for the third quarter of 2016 and instead reserved the amount for distribution at the time of the next distribution, which the Trust anticipates will be in January 2017. 
     
   Change in Trust Corpus  .  During the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, the trust corpus remained unchanged. 
     
   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  .  As required by the Trust Indenture, the Trust is intended to be passive in nature and the Trustee does not have any control over or any responsibility relating to the operation of the mines under which the Trust has any royalty interests and overriding royalty interests.  The Trustee has powers to collect and distribute proceeds received by the Trust and pay Trust liabilities and expenses and its actions have been limited to those activities.  As a result, the Trust has not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
     
   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  .  The Trust s condensed financial statements are prepared on a modified cash basis of accounting, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and as such there are no critical accounting policies or estimates. 
     
   Item 4.  Controls and Procedures  .   
     
   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  .  As of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, the officer of the Trustee conducted an evaluation of the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).  Based upon this evaluation, the 
     
 6   

Table of Contents   
     
  officer of the Trustee concluded that the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in timely alerting him of any material information relating to the Trust that is required to be disclosed by the Trust in the reports it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  
     
   Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  .  There were no changes in the Trust s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the Trust s most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Trust s internal control over financial reporting. 
     
   Limitations on Controls  .  The Trustee does not expect that the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures of the Trust s internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud.  Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met.  Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Trust have been detected. 
     
   PART II        OTHER INFORMATION    
     
   Item 1. Legal Proceedings  .   
     
  There are no material legal proceedings to which the Trust is a party.  
     
   Item 5. Other Information.     
     
  On August 16, 2016, the County Court in and for Douglas County, Nebraska (the  Court ) entered an order approving the modification of the Trust s Trust Indenture dated May 17, 1982, and restated on June 10, 1982 (together, the  Trust Agreement ).  The Court approved modifications to the Trust Agreement, which included permitting biannual distributions within ten days after June 30 and December 31 of each year, to the extent funds are available.  Historically, the Trust paid quarterly distributions after the end of each calendar quarter; however, because of the overall decrease in income from the coal leases, the Trust believes that fewer payments are more efficient and better utilize the Trust s resources.  A copy of the Order Approving Modification of Trust Agreement is filed with this Form 10-Q.

DOUGLAS COUNTY COURT       

OMAHA, NEBRASKA       

THIS MATTER came before the Court upon the Application for Modification of Trust Agreement in the matter of the Kiewit Royalty Trust Indenture, dated May 17, 1982 and restated on June 10, 1982 (the  Trust ) by the Trustee, U.S. Bank, NA, and the Court hereby finds that the proposed modification of the Trust is justified for the reasons set forth in the Application.  
     
   IT IS, THEREFORE, ORDERED THAT:   
     
  FIRST, Section 1.10 of the Trust is hereby deleted, and in lieu thereof, the following new Section 1.10 is substituted:  
     
   Section 1.10.  Biannual Distribution Amount  means, the excess of the amount of cash received by the Trust over all expenses paid by the Trust during the six (6) month period ending on the applicable Biannual Record Date; with such excess reduced by an amount determined by the Trustee that should be added to the Trust s cash reserves for payment of any future or contingent liabilities.   
     
  SECOND, Section 1.11 of the Trust is hereby deleted, and in lieu thereof, the following new Section 1.11 is substituted:  
     
   Section 1.11.  Biannual Record Date  means June 30  th  and December 31 st  of each calendar year.  
     
  THIRD, Section 1.12 of the Trust is hereby deleted, and in lieu thereof, the following new Section 1.12 is substituted:  
     
   Section 1.12.  Payment Date  means a date selected by the Trustee that is no later than ten (10) days after the end of each Biannual Record Date.   
     
  FOURTH, Section 4.02 of the Trust is hereby deleted, and in lieu thereof, the following new Section 4.02 is substituted:  
     
   4.02 RIGHTS OF CERTIFICATE HOLDERS. The Certificate Holders shall own pro rata the Beneficial Interest and shall be entitled to participate pro rata in the rights and benefits of the Certificate Holders under this Indenture. A Transferee takes and holds the same subject to all the terms and provisions of this Indenture, which shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the successors, assigns, legatees, heirs and personal representatives of the Certificate Holder. By a transfer of one or more Units represented by a Certificate, the Transferor thereby shall, with  

respect to such transferred Unit or Units, part with (i) all his Beneficial Interest attributable thereto (except as may be provided in Section 4.04 with respect to a transfer of Units after a Biannual Record Date but prior to the Payment Date); (ii) all his rights in, to and under such Certificate; and (iii) all interests, rights and benefits under this Trust of a Certificate Holder which are attributable to such Unit or Units as against all other Certificate Holders and the Trustee. The Certificates, the Units, and the rights, benefits and interests evidenced by either or both (including without limiting the foregoing, the entire Beneficial Interest) are and shall be held and construed to be in all respects intangible personal property, and the Certificates and Units evidenced thereby shall be bequeathed, assigned, disposed of and distributed as intangible personal property. No Certificate Holder as such shall have any legal title in or to any property interest which is a part of the Trust Estate, including, without limiting the foregoing, the Royalties or any part thereof, but the sole interest of each Certificate Holder shall be his interest in the Beneficial Interest and the obligation of the Trustee to hold, manage and dispose of the Trust Estate and to account for the same as in this Indenture provided. No Certificate Holder shall have the right to call for or demand or secure any partition of the royalties during the continuance of the Trust or during the period of liquidation and winding up under Section 9.03.   
     
  FIFTH, Section 4.04 of the Trust is hereby deleted, and in lieu thereof, the following new Section 4.04 is substituted:  
     
   4.04 REGISTRATION AND TRANSFER OF UNITS. The Units shall be transferable as against the Trustee only on the records of the Trustee upon the surrender of Certificates and compliance with such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, including regulations designed to ensure compliance with any laws or governmental regulations restricting ownership of interests in federal or state coal leases. Where a Transferor has been the owner of record for a period of less than three years, or in any other circumstance involving a transfer where the Trustee deems it appropriate, the Trustee shall, prior to effecting a transfer involving a purchase of Units, be provided by the Transferor, at the Transferor s expense, with an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Trustee that the Units will be transferred in compliance with federal and state securities law requirements. No service charge shall be made to the Transferor or Transferee for any transfer of a Unit, but the Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto. Until any such transfer the Trustee may treat the owner of any Certificate as shown by its records as the owner of the Units evidenced thereby and shall not be charged with notice of any claim or demand respecting such Certificate or the interest represented thereby by any other party. Any such transfer of a Unit shall, as to the Trustee, transfer to the Transferee as of the close of business on  the date of transfer all of the undivided right, title and interest of the Transferor in and to the Beneficial Interest with respect to such unit. Notwithstanding anything in this Indenture to the contrary, Certificate Holders of record on a Biannual Record Date shall be entitled to the Biannual Distribution Amount on the applicable Payment Date without regard to whether a transfer of Certificates occurred after the Biannual 

Record Date but prior to the Payment Date. In addition, any transfer of Certificates before the Biannual Record Date shall not entitled the Transferor to a pro rata amount of the Biannual Distribution Amount, but all such amounts shall be paid to the holder of such Certificates on the Biannual Record Date. In the event that a Certificate Holder transfers, in accordance with the following, less than all of the Units evidenced by a Certificate, the Trustee shall reissue a Certificate to the Transferor evidencing the number of Units retained by the Transferor and shall issue a new Certificate to each Transferee evidencing the Units transferred to such Transferee. As to matters affecting the title, ownership, warranty or transfer of Certificates, Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code and other statutes and rules with respect to the transfer of securities, each as adopted and then in force in the State of Nebraska, shall govern and apply. The death of any Certificate Holder shall not entitle the Transferee to an account or valuation for any purpose, but such Transferee shall succeed to all rights of the deceased Certificate Holder under this Indenture upon proper proof of title, satisfactory to the Trustee.   
     
  SIXTH, Section 5.02 of the Trust is hereby deleted, and in lieu thereof, the following new Section 5.02 is substituted:  
     
   Section 5.02. DISTRIBUTIONS. On each Payment Date, the Trustee shall distribute the Biannual Distribution Amount pro rata to the Certificate Holders of record on the most recent Biannual Record Date.   
     
  SEVENTH, Section 5.03 of the Trust is hereby deleted, and in lieu thereof, the following new Section 5.03 is substituted:  
     
   Section 5.03. FEDERAL INCOME TAX REPORTING. For federal income tax purposes, the Trustee shall file such returns and statements as in its judgment are required to comply with applicable provisions of the Code and regulations and to permit each Certificate Holder correctly to report his or her share of the income and deductions of the Trust.

   CERTIFICATION   
     
  I, Luke H. Paladino, certify that:  
     
  1.                                         I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Kiewit Royalty Trust, for which U.S. Bank National Association acts as Trustee; 
     
  2.                                         Based on my knowledge, this quarterly report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statement made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this quarterly report; 
     
  3.                                         Based on my knowledge, the financial statement, and other financial information included in this quarterly report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, distributable income and changes in trust corpus of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this quarterly report; 
     
  4.                                         I am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)), or for causing such procedures to be established and maintained, for the registrant and I have: 
     
  (a)                                    designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such controls and procedures to be designed under my supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to me by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this quarterly report is being prepared; 
     
  (b)                                    designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under my supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes on the basis of cash receipts and disbursements, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than generally accepted accounting principles; 
     
  (c)                                     evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report my conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, based on my evaluation; and 
     
  (d)                                    disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting. 
     
  5.                                         I have disclosed, based on my most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors: 
     
  (a)                                    all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
     
  (b)                                    any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
