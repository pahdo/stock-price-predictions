CARTER S, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (unaudited) 
   
  NOTE 1   THE COMPANY  
       
  Carter's, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company," "its," "us" and "our") design, source, and market branded childrenswear under the   Carter's, Child of     Mine, Just One You,     Precious Firsts  ,   OshKosh  ,     and other brands. The Company's products are sourced through contractual arrangements with manufacturers worldwide for wholesale distribution to major domestic and international retailers and for the Company's own retail stores and websites that market its brand name merchandise and other licensed products manufactured by other companies. As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company operated   636   Carter s stores in the United States,   267   OshKosh stores in the United States, and   156   stores in Canada. 

NOTE 2   BASIS OF PREPARATION AND ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Carter's, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.   
    
  In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to state fairly the consolidated financial condition, results of operations, comprehensive income, statement of stockholders' equity, and cash flows of the Company for the interim periods presented. Except as otherwise disclosed, all such adjustments consist only of those of a normal recurring nature. Operating results for the fiscal quarter and three fiscal quarters ended   October 1, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the 2016 fiscal year ending   December 31, 2016  . 
    
  The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.  
    
  The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   January 2, 2016   was derived from the Company's audited consolidated financial statements included in its most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain information and footnote disclosure normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC and the instructions to Form 10-Q.  
    
  The accounting policies the Company follows are set forth in its most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material subsequent changes to these accounting policies, except as noted below for new accounting pronouncements adopted at the beginning of fiscal 2016. 
    
  Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements At the Beginning of Fiscal 2016 
    
  At the beginning of fiscal 2016, the Company adopted the following Accounting Standards Updates ("ASU"): ASU No. 2015-05,   Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement   ("ASU 2015-05");     ASU No. 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   ("ASU 2015-03"); and ASU No. 2015-04,   Practical Expedient for the Measurement Date of an Employer's Defined Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets   ("ASU 2015-04"). 
  ASU 2015-05  
  The Company prospectively adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2015-05,   Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement   at the beginning of fiscal 2016, as it relates to the accounting for fees paid in connection with arrangements with cloud-based software providers. Under the new guidance, unless a software arrangement includes specific elements enabling customers to possess and operate software on platforms other than those offered by the cloud-based provider, the costs of such arrangements are accounted for as an operating expense in the period in which such costs are incurred. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 

6 

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 

For the Company's adoption of ASU 2015-03, refer to Note 6,   Long-Term Debt  , accompanying the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The Company adopted this guidance effective at the beginning of fiscal 2016 and the provisions have been applied to each prior period presented for comparative purposes. 
    
  For the Company's adoption of ASU 2015-04, refer to Note 8,   Employee Benefit Plans  , accompanying the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

NOTE 3   ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS 
    
  The components, net of applicable income taxes, of accumulated other comprehensive loss consisted of the following: 

Changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss for the   third   quarter and the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2016   consisted of additional losses of   $1.4 million   and additional gains of   $4.5 million   for foreign currency translation adjustments, respectively. Changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss for the   third   quarter and the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2015   consisted of additional losses of   $4.2 million   and   $10.4 million   for foreign currency translation adjustments, respectively. During the first, second and   third   quarters of both fiscal   2016   and fiscal   2015  , no amounts were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to the statement of operations.  

NOTE 4   GOODWILL AND TRADENAMES INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
    
  The Company's goodwill and other intangible assets were as follows: 

7 

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 

The changes in the carrying values between the comparative periods for goodwill related to the Company's 2011 acquisition of its Canadian business (Bonnie Togs) were solely due to fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates between the Canadian and U.S. dollar that were used in the remeasurement process for preparing the Company's consolidated financial statements.  The portion of the changes in the carrying values for other trademarks, including the related accumulated amortization, that was not attributable to amortization expense was also impacted by these same foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 
    
  The Company recorded approximately   $1.9 million   in amortization expense for the first   three   fiscal quarters ended   October 1, 2016  . Amortization expense for the   third   fiscal quarter ended   October 1, 2016   was not material. The Company recorded approximately   $1.0 million   and   $5.4 million   in amortization expense for the fiscal quarter and the first   three   fiscal quarters ended   October 3, 2015  , respectively. At   October 1, 2016  , one tradename had an unamortized balance of approximately   $3.2 million  , and the future amortization expense is estimated to be approximately   $0.2 million   for each of the next five fiscal years. 

NOTE 5   COMMON STOCK 
    
  SHARE REPURCHASES 
    
  In the second quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of shares of the Company's stock in an amount up to   $300 million  , inclusive of amounts remaining under previous authorizations. In the third quarter of fiscal 2013, the Board approved an additional   $400 million   accelerated share repurchase authorization, which has been completed. On   February 24, 2016  , the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new   $500 million   share repurchase program in addition to any amounts remaining under previous authorizations. The total aggregate remaining capacity under all of the outstanding repurchase authorizations as of   October 1, 2016   was approximately   $335.7 million  , based on settled repurchase transactions. The authorizations have no expiration date.  
    
  Open Market Repurchases 
    
  The Company repurchased and retired shares in open market transactions in the following amounts for the fiscal periods indicated: 

Future repurchases may occur from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. The timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by the Company's management, based on its evaluation of market conditions, share price, other investment priorities, and other factors. 
    
  DIVIDENDS 
    
  In the   third   fiscal quarter and the first   three   fiscal quarters ended   October 1, 2016  , the Company paid cash dividends per share of   $0.33   and   $0.99  , respectively.  In the   third   fiscal quarter and the first   three   fiscal quarters ended   October 3, 2015  , the Company paid cash dividends per share of   $0.22   and   $0.66  , respectively.  Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and based on a number of factors, including the Company's future financial performance and other investment priorities.  
    
  Provisions in the indenture governing the senior notes of The William Carter Company ("TWCC"), a 100% owned subsidiary of the Company, and in TWCC's secured revolving credit facility could have the effect of restricting the Company's ability to pay future cash dividends on, or make future repurchases of, its common stock. Provisions related to the indenture governing the senior notes are described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 2015 fiscal year ended January 2, 2016.  
  
    8 

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 

NOTE 6   LONG-TERM DEBT  

Long-term debt consisted of the following: 

In the first quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company replaced   $20.0 million   of outstanding borrowings under the then-existing secured revolving credit facility with CAD   25.5 million   of borrowings, which approximated   $20.3 million  . This transaction is reflected on the Company's consolidated statement of cash flows. 

Secured Revolving Credit Facility 
    
  As previously disclosed in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 2015 fiscal year ended January 2, 2016, the secured revolving credit facility was amended and restated in September 2015. The aggregate principal amount of the secured revolving credit facility is   $500 million   consisting of (i) a   $400 million   U.S. dollar revolving credit facility (including a   $175 million   sub-limit for letters of credit and a swing line sub-limit of   $50 million  ) available for borrowings by TWCC and (ii) a   $100 million   multicurrency revolving credit facility (including a   $40 million   sub-limit for letters of credit and a swing line sub-limit of   $15 million  ) available for borrowings by TWCC and certain other subsidiaries of TWCC in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, Euros, Pounds Sterling, or other currencies agreed to by the applicable lenders. The secured revolving credit facility also provides for incremental facilities in an aggregate amount not to exceed   $250 million  , either in the form of a commitment increase under the existing revolving credit facility or the incurrence of one or more tranches of term loans (with the aggregate U.S. dollar amount available to the Company not to exceed   $200 million   and the aggregate multicurrency amount available not to exceed   $50 million  ). The Company's secured revolving credit facility matures on   September 16, 2020  . 
    
  As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company had approximately   $185.4 million   in outstanding borrowings under its secured revolving credit facility, exclusive of   $4.8 million   of outstanding letters of credit. As of   October 1, 2016  , approximately   $309.7 million   remained available for future borrowing.  
    
  As of   October 1, 2016  , the interest rate margins applicable to the secured revolving credit facility were   1.375%   for   LIBOR   (London Interbank Offered Rate) rate loans (which may be adjusted based on a leverage-based pricing grid ranging from   1.125%   to   1.875%  ) and   0.375%   for base rate loans (which may be adjusted based on a leverage-based pricing grid ranging from   0.125%   to   0.875%  ). 
    
  As of   October 1, 2016  , U.S. dollar borrowings outstanding under the secured revolving credit facility accrued interest at a   LIBOR   rate plus the applicable   base rate  , which was   1.90%   on that date, and Canadian dollar borrowings accrued interest at a   CDOR   (Canadian Dollar Offered Rate  )   plus the applicable base rate, which was   2.26%   on that date. 
    
  As disclosed in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 2015 fiscal year ended January 2, 2016, the Company's secured revolving credit facility contains covenants, including affirmative and financial covenants.  As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with the financial and other covenants under the secured revolving credit facility. 

Senior Notes 

9 

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 

As of   October 1, 2016  , TWCC had outstanding   $400 million   principal amount of senior notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of   5.25%   per annum and maturing on August 15, 2021.  The senior notes are unsecured and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Carter's, Inc. and certain subsidiaries of TWCC.  On the Company's consolidated balance sheet, the senior notes are reported net of certain unamortized issuance-related costs, as described in the following section. 

Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncement Related to Debt Issuance Costs 
    
  The Company retrospectively adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   ("ASU 2015-03"), at the beginning of fiscal 2016, which requires that debt issuance costs be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, consistent with the presentation of a debt discount.  Prior to the issuance of ASU 2015-03, debt issuance costs were required to be presented as deferred charge assets, separate from the related debt liability.  The guidance did not change the recognition and measurement requirements for debt issuance costs.  The Company reclassified   $4.8 million  ,   $5.5 million  , and   $5.7 million   of unamortized issuance-related debt costs associated with the Company's senior notes from other assets to Long-term debt, net within its consolidated balance sheets as of   October 1, 2016  , January 2, 2016, and   October 3, 2015  , respectively. Other than this balance sheet reclassification, the adoption of ASU 2015-03 did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Fees paid to lenders to secure revolving lines of credit continue to be presented as a deferred charge (asset) on the balance sheet. 

NOTE 7   STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
       
  The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense as follows: 

NOTE 8   EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS  
    
  The Company maintains a defined contribution plan and two defined benefit plans. The two defined benefit plans include the OshKosh B'Gosh pension plan and a post-retirement life and medical plan. 
       
  OSHKOSH B'GOSH PENSION PLAN 
       
  The net periodic pension cost (benefit) included in the statement of operations was comprised of:   

POST-RETIREMENT LIFE AND MEDICAL PLAN 
  
    10 

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 

The components of post-retirement benefit expense charged to the statement of operations were as follows:   

Simplified Measurement Date for Defined Benefit Plan Assets and Obligations 
  The Company adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2015-04,   Practical Expedient for the Measurement Date of an Employer's Defined Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets   ("ASU 2015-04") at the beginning of fiscal 2016.  However, the Company is not required to make any such measurements until the end of fiscal 2016. ASU 2015-04 allows employers with fiscal year ends that do not coincide with a calendar month end to make an accounting policy election to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the end of the month closest to their fiscal year end (i.e., on an alternative measurement date). An employer that makes this election must consistently apply the alternative measurement date from year to year and to all of its defined benefit plans. The Company expects to make the accounting policy election to use December 31 as the measurement date for all of its defined benefit plan assets and obligations for fiscal 2016 and subsequent years.  Measurement dates for prior periods will not be impacted.  Since the Company's current 52-week fiscal year will end on December 31, 2016, it will not be necessary for the Company to utilize an alternate measurement date for fiscal 2016, and thus the initial adoption of ASU 2015-04 at the beginning of fiscal 2016 will not have an impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. 

NOTE 9   INCOME TAXES 
    
  During the first quarters of fiscal 2016 and 2015, the IRS and various state tax authorities completed examinations of the Company's income tax returns.  As a result, the Company recognized income tax benefits related to prior years of approximately   $0.4 million   and   $1.8 million   in the first quarters of fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively.  In most cases, the Company is no longer subject to state and local tax authority examinations for years prior to fiscal 2012. 
    
  As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company had gross unrecognized income tax benefits of approximately   $10.1 million  , of which   $7.2 million  , if ultimately recognized, may affect the Company's effective tax rate in the periods settled.  The Company has recorded tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is more likely than not, but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductions.   
    
  Included in the reserves for unrecognized tax benefits at   October 1, 2016   were approximately   $1.2 million   of reserves for which the statute of limitations is expected to expire within the next fiscal year.  If these tax benefits are ultimately recognized, such recognition, net of federal income taxes, may affect the annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 or fiscal 2017 along with the effective tax rate in the quarter in which the benefits are recognized.   
    
  The Company recognizes interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of interest expense and recognizes penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.  During the fiscal quarter and the first three fiscal quarters ended   October 1, 2016   and the fiscal quarter and the first three fiscal quarters ended   October 3, 2015  , interest expense recorded on uncertain tax positions was not significant. The Company had approximately   $0.9 million  ,   $0.8 million  , and   $0.9 million   of interest accrued on uncertain tax positions as of   October 1, 2016  ,   January 2, 2016  , and   October 3, 2015  , respectively.      

NOTE 10   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 

The following tables set forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy, the Company s financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis. 

(1) Included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
  (2) Included in Other current liabilities     i  n the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet. 

INVESTMENTS 
    
  The Company invests in marketable securities, principally equity-based mutual funds, to mitigate the risk associated with the investment return on employee deferrals of compensation.  
    
  Gains on the investments in marketable securities were   $0.4 million   and   $0.8 million   for the   third   fiscal quarter and the first   three   fiscal quarters ended   October 1, 2016  , respectively.  Losses on the investments in marketable securities were   $0.4 million   and   $0.1 million   for the   third   fiscal quarter and the first   three   fiscal quarters ended   October 3, 2015  .  These amounts are included in Other expense (income), net on the Company's consolidated statement of operations included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  

FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS 
    
  Fair values for unsettled foreign exchange forward contracts are calculated by using readily observable market inputs (market-quoted currency exchange rates in effect between U.S. and Canadian dollars). 
    
  At   October 1, 2016  , the notional value of the open foreign currency forward contracts was approximately   $6.0 million  .  These contracts were marked-to-market, or to fair value, resulting in an unrealized loss of approximately   $0.4 million   at   October 1, 2016  . 
    
  The Company recorded realized losses of approximately   $0.6 million   and   $0.8 million   for foreign currency forward contracts settled during the   third   fiscal quarter and the first   three   fiscal quarters ended   October 1, 2016  , respectively. The Company recorded realized gains of approximately   $1.6 million   and   $1.9 million   for foreign currency forward contracts settled during the   third   fiscal quarter and the first   three   fiscal quarters ended   October 3, 2015  . These amounts are included in Other expense (income), net on the Company's consolidated statement of operations.  The Company did not apply hedge accounting treatment on any of these foreign currency forward contracts.  

CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION 
    
  The following table summarizes the changes in the contingent consideration liability during the third fiscal quarter and first three fiscal quarters of 2015 related to the Company's 2011 acquisition of Bonnie Togs in Canada:

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 

The final payment under the earn-out obligation was paid during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. At   October 1, 2016  ,   January 2, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  , the Company had no remaining contingent consideration liability related to the 2011 acquisition of Bonnie Togs in Canada.  

BORROWINGS 
    
  As of   October 1, 2016  , the fair value of the Company's   $185.4 million   in outstanding borrowings under its secured revolving credit facility approximated carrying value.   
    
  The fair value of the Company's senior notes at   October 1, 2016   was approximately   $419 million  . The fair value of these senior notes with a notional value and carrying value of   $400 million   was estimated using a quoted price as provided in the secondary market, which considers     the Company's credit risk and market related conditions, and is therefore within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

NOTE 15   PENDING ADOPTION OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  , which has been codified in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 606,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  .  This guidance clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and will be applicable to all contracts with customers regardless of industry-specific or transaction-specific fact patterns. Further, the guidance will require improved disclosures as well as additional disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized. The standard is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  
  
    16 

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 

2018, including interim periods within that first fiscal year, and early adoption is now permitted for 2017. Upon becoming effective, the Company will apply the amendments in the updated standard either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented, or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application. Since the original issuance of ASU 2014-09, the FASB has issued several amendments and updates to this guidance, and additional amendments and updates are currently being considered by the FASB.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.  

Simplified Subsequent Measurement of Inventory 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,   Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory   ("ASU 2015-11"). Upon adoption by an entity, ASU 2015-11 will simplify subsequent measurements of inventory by replacing the current lower of cost or market test with a lower of cost and net realizable value test. The new guidance applies only to inventories for which cost is determined by methods other than last-in-first-out (LIFO) and the retail inventory method. For inventory within the scope of ASU 2015-11, entities will be required to compare the cost of inventory to only one measure, its net realizable value, and not the three measures required by current guidance ("market," "subject to a floor," and a "ceiling"). When evidence exists that the net realizable value of inventory is less than its cost (due to damage, physical deterioration, obsolescence, changes in price levels or other causes), entities will recognize the difference as a loss in earnings in the period in which it occurs. ASU 2015-11 is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within the year of adoption. Early adoption is permitted. The Company expects to adopt the provisions of ASU 2015-11 at the beginning of fiscal 2017. At this time, the Company does not believe the adoption of ASU 2015-11 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 

Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes 
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes   ("ASU 2015-17"). Current GAAP requires the deferred taxes for each tax jurisdiction (or tax-paying component of a jurisdiction) to be presented as a net current asset or liability and net noncurrent asset or liability. ASU 2015-17 requires a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction analysis based on the classification of the assets and liabilities to which the underlying temporary differences relate based on the period in which the attribute is expected to be realized. Upon adoption of ASU 2015-17, all deferred tax assets and liabilities will be classified as noncurrent on an entity's balance sheet. As a result, each jurisdiction will have only one net noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability. ASU 2015-17 will not change the existing guidance that prohibits the offsetting of deferred tax liabilities of one jurisdiction against the deferred tax assets of another jurisdiction. ASU 2015-17 is effective for public entities in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods in the year of adoption. Early adoption is permitted, and adoption may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. The Company plans to adopt ASU 2015-17 at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2017. ASU 2015-17 will only involve classification of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and will have no impact on the Company's results of operations or cash flows. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-17 will have a material effect on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. 

Leases 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued new lease accounting guidance in ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases  .  Under this new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases):  1) a lease liability equal to the lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis and 2) a right-of-use asset which will represent the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The new standard will be effective for the Company at the beginning of fiscal 2019, including interim periods within the year of adoption. The new standard requires a modified retrospective basis, and early adoption is permitted.  The Company is still evaluating the potential impacts of ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements. However, the Company expects that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will require the Company to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities that will be material to the Company's consolidated balance sheet.   

Accounting for Share-Based Payments to Employees 

17 

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ("ASU 2016-09"), which amends ASC Topic 718,   Stock Compensation  .  ASU 2016-09 includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements.  All tax benefits and deficiencies related to share-based payments will be recognized and recorded through the statement of operations for all awards settled or expiring after the adoption of ASU 2016-09.  Currently, tax benefits in excess of compensation costs ("windfalls") are recorded in equity, and tax deficiencies ("shortfalls") are recorded in equity to the extent of previous windfalls and then to the statement of operations.  ASU 2016-09 will also require, either prospectively or retrospectively, that all tax-related cash flows resulting from share-based payments be reported as operating activities on the statement of cash flows, a change from the current requirement to present windfall tax benefits as an inflow from financing activities and an outflow from operating activities on the statement of cash flows.  Additionally, ASU 2016-09 will allow entities to make an accounting policy election for the impact of most types of forfeitures on the recognition of expense for share-based payment awards by allowing the forfeitures to be either estimated, as is currently required, or recognized when they actually occur.  If elected, the change to recognize forfeitures when they occur will be adopted using a modified retrospective approach, with a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to retained earnings. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for the Company at the beginning of fiscal 2017, including interim periods in the year of adoption.  Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period.  The potential impacts that the adoption of ASU 2016-09 will have on the Company's income tax expense or benefit and related cash flows during and after the period of adoption are dependent in part upon future grants and vesting of stock-based compensation awards and other factors that are not fully controllable or predicable by the Company such as the future market price of the Company's common stock, the timing of employee exercises of vested stock options, and the future achievement of performance criteria that affect performance-based awards.  However, based on the Company s stock price as of October 1, 2016 and its     outstanding unvested restricted stock awards and unexercised stock options, the Company anticipates that adoption of this pronouncement at the beginning of fiscal 2017 will reduce its income tax expense and increase its net income, and these anticipated income tax benefits will be reported as a component of cash flows from operating activities instead of cash flows from financing activities.

NOTE 16   GUARANTOR UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
    
  The Company s senior notes constitute debt obligations of its wholly-owned subsidiary, The William Carter Company ("TWCC" or the "Subsidiary Issuer"), are unsecured and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Carter s, Inc. (the "Parent"), by certain of the Parent's current domestic subsidiaries (other than TWCC), and, subject to certain exceptions, future restricted subsidiaries that guarantee the Company s secured revolving credit facility or certain other debt of the Company or the subsidiary guarantors.  Under specific customary conditions, the guarantees are not full and unconditional because subsidiary guarantors can be released and relieved of their obligations under customary circumstances contained in the indenture governing the senior notes. These circumstances include, among others, the following, so long as other applicable provisions of the indentures are adhered to: any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of any subsidiary guarantor, any sale or other disposition of capital stock of any subsidiary guarantor, or designation of any restricted subsidiary that is a subsidiary guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary. 
    
  For additional information, refer to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 2015 fiscal year ended January 2, 2016. 
  The condensed consolidating financial information for the Parent, the Subsidiary Issuer, and the guarantor and non-guarantor subsidiaries has been prepared from the books and records maintained by the Company. The accompanying condensed consolidating financial information has been prepared and presented pursuant to SEC Regulation S-X Rule 3-10. The financial information may not necessarily be indicative of the financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows, had the Parent, Subsidiary Issuer, guarantor or non-guarantor subsidiaries operated as independent entities.  
  Intercompany revenues and expenses included in the subsidiary records are eliminated in consolidation. As a result of this activity, an amount due to/due from affiliates will exist at any time. The principal elimination entries relate to investments in subsidiaries and intercompany balances and transactions. The Company has accounted for investments in subsidiaries under the equity method. The guarantor subsidiaries are 100% owned directly or indirectly by the Parent and all guarantees are joint, several, and unconditional. 
  In December 2015, as part of a foreign subsidiary restructuring, certain non-guarantor subsidiaries became subsidiaries of certain other non-guarantor subsidiaries. The restructuring did not retroactively impact the prior status of the guarantor and the non-guarantor subsidiaries, and accordingly the condensed consolidating financial information for periods prior to the restructuring have not been adjusted to reflect the restructuring.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
    
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 relating to our future performance, including, without limitation, statements with respect to our anticipated financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and fiscal year 2016, or any other future period, assessment of our performance and financial position, and drivers of our sales and earnings growth. Such statements are based on current expectations only, and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or not materialize, or should any of the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated, or projected. Certain of the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and performance to differ materially are described under the heading "Risk Factors" in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. 
  OVERVIEW 
    
  We are the largest branded marketer in the United States ("U.S.") and in Canada of apparel exclusively for babies and young children. We own two of the most highly recognized and most trusted brand names in the children's apparel industry,   Carter's   and   OshKosh B'gosh   ("  OshKosh  "). Established in 1865, our   Carter's   brand is recognized and trusted by consumers for high-quality apparel for children sizes newborn to eight. Established in 1895,   OshKosh   is a well-known brand, trusted by consumers for apparel for children sizes newborn to 14, with a focus on playclothes for toddlers and young children. Given each brand's product category emphasis and brand aesthetic, we believe they provide a complementary product offering. We have extensive experience in the young children's apparel market and focus on delivering products that satisfy our consumers' needs. Our strategy is to market high-quality, essential core products at prices that deliver an attractive value proposition for consumers. 
    
  The following is a discussion of our results of operations and current financial condition. This should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-Q and audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 2015 fiscal year ended   January 2, 2016  .

    ITEM 2.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

STORE COUNT DATA  

Substantially all of the OshKosh retail store openings included in the above table are in a "side-by-side" format with a Carter's retail store. We operate "side-by-side" locations wherein adjacent retail stores for our   Carter's   and   OshKosh   brands are connected, allowing customers to shop for both brands in a single location. Each "side-by-side" location is counted as one Carter's retail store and one OshKosh retail store. As of   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  , the U.S. store count data presented in the above table included 127 and 86 "side-by-side" locations, respectively. 
    
  COMPARABLE SALES METRICS 
    
  Our comparable store sales metrics include sales for all stores and eCommerce websites that were open during the comparable fiscal period, including certain remodeled stores and relocated stores. A store or eCommerce website becomes comparable following 13 consecutive full months of operation. If a store relocates within the same center with no business interruption or material change in square footage, the sales of such store will continue to be included in the comparable store metrics. If a store relocates to another center, or if there is a material change in square footage, such store is treated as a new store. Stores that are closed during the relevant fiscal period are included in the comparable store sales metrics up to and including the last full fiscal month of operations. 

THIRD   FISCAL QUARTER AND FIRST   THREE   FISCAL QUARTERS ENDED   OCTOBER 1, 2016   COMPARED TO   THIRD   FISCAL QUARTER AND FIRST   THREE   FISCAL QUARTERS ENDED   OCTOBER 3, 2015    
    
  U.S. COMPARABLE RETAIL SALES 
    
  Changes in comparable sales for our two U.S. retail segments, Carter's Retail and Oshkosh Retail, were as follows: 

The decreases in comparable retail store sales for Carter's and OshKosh during the third quarter and the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, as compared to the comparable fiscal periods in 2015, were primarily due to decreases in the number of transactions due to lower demand for seasonal products and a lower average price per unit.  
    
  For the year-to-date period ended October 1, 2016, we believe that Carter's and OshKosh retail comparable sales were negatively affected by lower demand from international consumers shopping in our U.S. stores and eCommerce websites, which was likely influenced by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies.  However, we believe these effects were less pronounced in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 as our U.S. retail businesses experienced stabilization in demand from international customers.  
  
    33 

    ITEM 2.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

The increases in eCommerce comparable sales for Carter's and OshKosh during both periods in fiscal   2016  , as compared to the comparable fiscal periods in 2015, were primarily due to an increase in the number of transactions.  

CONSOLIDATED NET SALES 
    
  In the   third   quarter of fiscal   2016  , consolidated net sales   increased     $51.6 million  , or   6.1%  , to   $901.4 million   from   $849.8 million   in the   third   quarter of fiscal   2015  . For the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2016  , consolidated net sales   increased     $117.6 million  , or   5.5%  , to   $2.26 billion   from   $2.15 billion   in the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2015  . The increases during both periods reflected sales growth in all of our segments except OshKosh Wholesale, as presented below. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the   third   quarter of fiscal   2016   as compared to the   third   quarter of fiscal   2015   had a favorable impact on our consolidated net sales of approximately   $0.3 million  . Changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the first three quarters of fiscal   2016   as compared to the first three quarters of fiscal   2015   had an unfavorable impact on our consolidated net sales of approximately   $6.7 million  . 
    
  Net sales by segment, and each segment's percentage of consolidated net sales, were as follows: 

CARTER'S WHOLESALE SALES (U.S.)   
    
  Carter's Wholesale segment net sales   increased     $12.7 million  , or   3.7%  , in the   third   quarter of fiscal   2016   to   $356.3 million   from   $343.6 million   in the   third   quarter of fiscal   2015  . This increase in net sales was primarily the result of a 2.8% increase in the average price per unit due to a favorable product mix and a   0.9%   increase in the number of units shipped. 
    
  Carter's Wholesale segment net sales   increased     $17.5 million  , or   2.1%  , in the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2016   to   $842.1 million   from   $824.6 million   in the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2015  . This increase in net sales was primarily a result of a 2.4% increase in the average price per unit due to favorable product mix, partially offset by a 0.3% decrease in the number of units shipped. 

CARTER'S RETAIL SALES (U.S.) 
    
  Carter's Retail segment net sales   increased     $19.8 million  , or   6.7%  , in the   third   quarter of fiscal   2016   to   $314.7 million   from   $294.9 million   in the   third   quarter of fiscal   2015  . This   increase   in net sales primarily reflected a/an: 

Increase of   $16.4 million   from new stores;

Compared to the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2015  , our Canadian total retail comparable sales increased   7.2%   in the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2016  , primarily due to retail stores comparable sales growth of   5.4%   and eCommerce comparable sales growth of   37.3%  .  

GROSS MARGIN AND GROSS PROFIT 
    
  Our consolidated gross margin   increased   from   40.9%   in the   third   quarter of fiscal   2015   to   41.7%   in the   third   quarter of fiscal   2016  , primarily due to favorable product costs, partially offset by increased promotional pricing in our retail businesses.

The decreases in both of the fiscal 2016 periods, as compared to the corresponding fiscal 2015 periods, were attributable to a decrease in income from certain licensees due in part to the insourcing of formerly licensed product categories, partially offset by sales growth from other domestic licensees. We benefited from favorable settlements in the first quarter of fiscal 2015.

    60 bps increase in marketing expenses; and 
                
    80 bps decrease in royalty income due to a reduction in the number of licensees. 

(ee) International segment operating income   increased   by   $6.2 million  , or   20.1%  , to   $37.2 million   in the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2016   from   $31.0 million   in the first   three   quarters of   2015  . This segment's operating margin   increased     110   bps from   13.5%   in the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2015   to   14.6%   in the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2016  . The primary drivers of the change in operating margin were a/an: 

240 bps increase in gross profit, primarily driven by growth in higher margin retail store and eCommerce channels, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange impacts;  
                
    80 bps increase in SG A expenses primarily due to a/an: 
                
    110 bps increase in expenses associated with new retail stores, China eCommerce and new China wholesale business; 
                
    20 bps increase in distribution and freight expenses; 
                
    20 bps increase in performance-based compensation expenses; 
                
    20 bps increase in information technology expenses; 
                
    80 bps decrease in accretion expense for contingent consideration related to the Bonnie Togs acquisition; and 
                
    50 bps decrease in royalty income due to a reduction in licensees. 

Unallocated Corporate Expenses 
    
  Unallocated corporate expenses   increased   by   $0.7 million  , or   2.9%  , in the   third   quarter of fiscal   2016   compared to the   third   quarter of fiscal   2015  . Unallocated corporate expenses, as a percentage of consolidated net sales,   decreased   from   2.9%   in the   third   quarter of of fiscal   2015   to   2.8%   in the   third   quarter of fiscal   2016  . The increase in corporate expenses primarily reflected a/an: 

Increase of $1.7 million in other general and administrative expenses; 
                
    Increase of $1.4 million in expenses related to information technology and systems; 
                
    Decrease of $1.1 million in insurance and other employee related benefits costs; and  
                
    Decrease of $1.0 million in amortization of the H.W. Carter   Sons tradenames. 

Unallocated corporate expenses   decreased   by   $1.4 million  , or   1.8%  , in the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2016   compared to the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2015  . Unallocated corporate expenses, as a percentage of consolidated net sales,   decreased   from   3.5%   in the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2015   to   3.2%   in the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2016  . The decrease in corporate expenses primarily reflected a/an: 

Decrease of $3.5 million in amortization of the H.W. Carter   Sons tradenames; 
                
    Decrease of $2.8 million in performance-based compensation; 
                
    Decrease of $1.9 million in insurance and other employee related benefits costs; 
                
    Increase of $3.5 million in expenses related to information technology and systems; and 
                
    Increase of $2.9 million in other general and administrative expenses. 

INTEREST EXPENSE 
  
    41 

    ITEM 2.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

Interest expense and effective interest rate calculations include the amortization of debt issuance costs. 
    
  Interest expense in the   third   quarter of fiscal   2016   and   2015   was approximately   $6.8 million   and   $6.9 million  , respectively. Weighted-average borrowings for the   third   quarter of fiscal   2016   were approximately   $585.6 million   with an effective interest rate of   4.57%  , compared to weighted-average borrowings for the   third   quarter of fiscal   2015   of   $585.5 million   with an effective interest rate of   4.69%  .   
    
  Interest expense in the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2016   and   2015   was approximately   $20.3 million   and   $20.5 million  , respectively. Weighted-average borrowings for the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2016   were approximately   $585.3 million   with an effective interest rate of   4.58%  , compared to weighted-average borrowings for the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2015   of   $586.4 million   with an effective interest rate of   4.65%  .   
    
  The decreases in the effective interest rate for the   third   quarter and the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2016   compared to the   third   quarter and the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2015   was primarily due to lower borrowing costs on the U.S. and Canadian borrowings outstanding under our secured revolving credit facility in fiscal 2016. 

OTHER EXPENSE (INCOME), NET 
    
  Other expense (income), net is comprised primarily of unrealized gains and losses from unsettled foreign currency forward contracts and unsettled foreign currency transactions, and realized gains and losses on settled foreign currency forward contracts and settled foreign currency transactions.  These amounts represented a net gain of   $0.1 million   and a net loss of   $3.6 million   for the   third   quarter and the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2016  , respectively.  These amounts represented a net gain of $0.6 million and a net gain of $0.5 million for the   third   quarter and the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2015  , respectively.  

INCOME TAXES 
    
  Our consolidated effective income tax rate for the   third   quarter of fiscal   2016   was   34.9%   compared to   36.0%   for the   third   quarter of fiscal   2015  . Our consolidated effective income tax rate for the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2016   was   35.1%   compared to   35.7%   for the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2015  . The lower effective rates both periods in fiscal   2016   were primarily due to expansion of our international business, partially offset by favorable settlements of federal and state tax audits for 2011, 2012, and 2013 during the first quarter of fiscal 2015.   
    
  For the full fiscal year   2016  , we estimate our consolidated effective income tax rate to be approximately   35.2%  . 

NET INCOME 
    
  Our consolidated net income for the   third   quarter of fiscal   2016     increased   by   $1.5 million  , or   1.9%  , to   $80.8 million   compared to   $79.3 million   in the   third   quarter of fiscal   2015  . Our consolidated net income for the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2016     increased   by   $5.8 million  , or   3.5%  , to   $171.0 million   compared to   $165.2 million   in the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2015  .  The increases were due to the factors previously discussed. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION, CAPITAL RESOURCES, AND LIQUIDITY  
    
  Our primary cash needs are for working capital and capital expenditures. We expect that our primary sources of liquidity will continue to be cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flow from operations, and borrowings available under our secured revolving credit facility.  We expect that these sources will fund our ongoing requirements for the foreseeable future.  Further, we do not expect current economic conditions to prevent us from meeting our cash requirements. These sources of liquidity may be affected by events described in our risk factors, as further discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. 

42 

    ITEM 2.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company had approximately   $140.6 million   of cash and cash equivalents in major financial institutions, including approximately   $40.9 million   in financial institutions located outside of the United States. We maintain cash deposits with major financial institutions that exceed the insurance coverage limits provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in the United States and by similar insurers for deposits located outside the United States.  To mitigate this risk, we utilize a policy of allocating cash deposits among major financial institutions that have been evaluated by us and third-party rating agencies. 

BALANCE SHEET 
    
  Net accounts receivable at   October 1, 2016   were   $271.2 million   compared to   $246.6 million   at   October 3, 2015   and   $207.6 million   at   January 2, 2016  . The overall   increase   of   $24.6 million  , or   10.0%  , at   October 1, 2016   compared to   October 3, 2015   primarily reflected sales growth. Due to the seasonal nature of our operations, the net accounts receivable balance at   October 1, 2016   is not comparable to the net accounts receivable balance of   $207.6 million   at   January 2, 2016  . 
    
  Inventories at   October 1, 2016   were   $552.7 million   compared to   $511.5 million   at   October 3, 2015   and   $469.9 million   at   January 2, 2016  .  The   increase   of   $41.2 million  , or   8.1%  , at   October 1, 2016   compared to   October 3, 2015   primarily reflected business growth and the timing of inventory purchases. Due to the seasonal nature of our operations, the inventories balance at   October 1, 2016   is not comparable to the inventories balance of   $469.9 million   at   January 2, 2016  . 

CASH FLOW 
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities for the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2016   was   $116.6 million   compared to net cash provided by operating activities of   $146.0 million   in the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2015  . This decrease in operating cash flow for the 2016 period reflected unfavorable changes in net working capital primarily due to the timing of payments, partially offset by an increase in net income.  
    
  Capital expenditures were   $71.2 million   in the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2016   compared to   $77.0 million   in the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2015  , primarily reflecting 2016 expenditures of approximately   $42.8 million   for our U.S. and international retail store openings and re-modelings,   $17.4 million   for information technology initiatives,   $5.3 million   for distribution and office facilities, and   $2.1 million   for wholesale fixtures.  
    
  We plan to invest approximately   $105 million   in total capital expenditures for all of fiscal 2016, primarily for our U.S. and international retail store openings and re-modelings, and information technology initiatives. 
    
  Net cash used in financing activities was   $287.4 million   in the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2016   compared to   $120.5 million   in the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2015  . This increase in cash used during the 2016 period primarily reflected increases in repurchases of our common stock and higher dividend payments. 

SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY  
    
  Our secured revolving credit facility, which was amended and restated in September 2015, provides for (i) a   $400 million   U.S. dollar revolving facility (including a   $175 million   sub-limit for letters of credit and a swing line sub-limit of   $50 million  ) available for borrowings in U.S. dollars and (ii) a   $100 million   multicurrency revolving facility (including a   $40 million   sub-limit for letters of credit and a swing line sub-limit of   $15 million  ) available for borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, Euros, Pounds Sterling, or other currencies agreed to by the applicable lenders. Our secured revolving credit facility also provides for incremental facilities in an aggregate amount not to exceed $250 million, either in the form of a commitment increase under the existing credit facility or the incurrence of one or more tranches of term loans (with the aggregate U.S. dollar amount not to exceed $200 million and the aggregate multicurrency amount not to exceed $50 million). Our secured revolving credit facility matures   September 16, 2020  . 
    
  As of   October 1, 2016  , we had   $185.4 million   in outstanding borrowings under our secured revolving credit facility, exclusive of   $4.8 million   of outstanding letters of credit. As of   October 1, 2016  , approximately   $309.7 million   was available for future borrowing.   

43 

    ITEM 2.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

The interest rate margins applicable to our secured revolving credit facility are presently   1.375%   for   LIBOR   rate loans (which may be adjusted based on a leverage-based pricing grid ranging from   1.125%   to   1.875%  ) and 0.375% for base rate loans (which may be adjusted based on a leverage-based pricing grid ranging from   0.125%   to   0.875%  )  . 
    
  As of   October 1, 2016  , U.S. dollar borrowings outstanding under the secured revolving credit facility accrued interest at a   LIBOR   rate plus the applicable   base rate  , which was equal to   1.90%   on that date, and Canadian borrowings accrued interest at a CDOR (Canadian Dollar Offered Rate) plus the applicable base rate, which was   2.26%   on that date. 
    
  As of   October 1, 2016  , we were in compliance with the financial and other covenants under our secured revolving credit facility.  

SENIOR NOTES 
    
  As of   October 1, 2016  , our wholly-owned operating subsidiary The William Carter Company ("TWCC") had   $400.0 million   principal amount of senior notes outstanding, bearing interest at a fixed rate of   5.25%   per annum, and maturing on August 15, 2021. On our consolidated balance sheet, the   $400.0 million   outstanding is reported net of   $4.8 million  ,   $5.5 million   and   $5.7 million   unamortized issuance-related debt costs at   October 1, 2016  ,   January 2, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  , respectively. The senior notes are unsecured and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Carter's, Inc. and certain subsidiaries of TWCC.  

SHARE REPURCHASES 
    
  On February 24, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a new $500 million share repurchase program, in addition to the amounts remaining under previous authorizations. In the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2016  , the Company repurchased and retired   2,358,947   shares in open market transactions for approximately   $239.1 million   at an average price of   $101.37   per share. In the first   three   quarters of fiscal   2015  , the Company repurchased and retired   795,025   shares in open market transactions for approximately   $78.3 million  , at an average price of   $98.54   per share.  
    
  The total remaining capacity under all remaining repurchase authorizations as of   October 1, 2016   was approximately   $335.7 million  . Future repurchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, with the level and timing of activity being at management's discretion depending on market conditions, share price, other investment priorities, and other factors. The share repurchase authorizations have no expiration date. 

DIVIDENDS 
    
  In the first, second and third quarters of fiscal   2016  , we paid quarterly cash dividends of   $0.33   per share in each quarter.  In the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 2015, we paid quarterly cash dividends of   $0.22   per share in each quarter. Future declarations of quarterly dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be based on a number of factors, including our future financial performance and other investment priorities. 
    
  As disclosed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 2015 fiscal year ended January 2, 2016, provisions in our secured revolving credit facility and indenture governing our senior notes could have the effect of restricting our ability to pay future cash dividends on or make future repurchases of our common stock.  

SEASONALITY 
    
  We experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales and profitability due to the timing of certain holidays and key retail shopping periods, which generally have resulted in declines in our net sales and gross profit in the first half of our fiscal year versus the second half. Accordingly, our results of operations during any interim period during the fiscal year may not be indicative of the results we expect for the full fiscal year. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

44 

    ITEM 2.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  Preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
    
  Our critical accounting policies and estimates are described under the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in Item 7 of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 2015 fiscal year ended   January 2, 2016  .  Our critical accounting policies and estimates are those policies that require management's most difficult and subjective judgments and may result in the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our critical accounting policies and estimates include: revenue recognition and accounts receivable allowance, inventory, goodwill and tradename, accrued expenses, loss contingencies, accounting for income taxes, foreign currency, employee benefit plans, and stock-based compensation arrangements.  There have been no material changes in these critical accounting policies and estimates from those described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, except to update the Company's accounting policy for the measurement date used for defined benefit plan assets and obligations as disclosed in Note 8,   Employee Benefit Plans  , to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  
    
  Additionally, information related to the pending adoption of recently issued accounting standards is provided in Note 15,   Pending Adoption of Recent Accounting Pronouncements  , to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Currency and Interest Rate Risks  
    
  In the operation of our business, we have market risk exposures including those related to foreign currency and interest rates. We employ various strategies to attempt to minimize our exposure to these risks. 
    
  Currency Risk 
    
  We contract for production with third parties, primarily in Asia. While these contracts are stated in U.S. dollars, there can be no assurance that the cost for the future production of our products will not be affected by exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the local currencies of these contractors. Due to the number of currencies involved, we cannot quantify the potential impact of future currency fluctuations on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows for future periods.  
    
  The financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and weighted-average exchange rates for revenues and expenses.  Gains and losses resulting from translating assets and liabilities from the functional currency to U.S. dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 
    
  Fluctuations in exchange rates, primarily between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar, may affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.  Transactions by our Canadian subsidiary may be denominated in a currency other than the entity's functional currency, which is the Canadian dollar.  Foreign currency transaction gains and losses also include the impact of non-current intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries that are marked to market.  In our statement of operations, these gains and losses are recorded within Other expense, net. 
    
  As part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar, our Canadian subsidiary may use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge purchases that are made in U.S. dollars, primarily for inventory purchases.  As part of this strategy, we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts that have maturities of less than 12 months to provide continuing coverage throughout the hedging period. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
  
    45 

Our operating results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on our secured revolving credit facility, which carries variable interest rates.  Our weighted-average variable rate borrowings outstanding as of   October 1, 2016   were   $185.4 million  . An increase or decrease of 1% in the effective interest rate on that amount would increase or decrease our annual pre-tax interest expense by approximately $  1.9 million  . 

Other Risks 
    
  We enter into various purchase order commitments with our suppliers.  We can cancel these arrangements, although in some instances we may be subject to a termination charge reflecting a percentage of work performed prior to cancellation.    

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of   October 1, 2016  . 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  In connection with the Company s continuing efforts to enhance its internal controls over financial reporting, at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2016 the Company completed the replacement of a financial information system used to process and record certain of the Company s financial transactions.  Testing is ongoing and expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. 
    
  Other than this financial system replacement, there were no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting during the   third   quarter of fiscal   2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II 

ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  The Company is subject to various claims and pending or threatened lawsuits in the normal course of our business. The Company is not currently a party to any legal proceedings that it believes would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  
    
  There have been no material changes to the risk factors described in our Form 10-K for the 2015 fiscal year ended January 2, 2016. 

46 

ITEM 2.  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
    
  Share Repurchases 
       
  The following table provides information about share repurchases during the third quarter of fiscal 2016: 

(1) 
    Includes shares of our common stock surrendered by our employees to satisfy required tax withholding upon the vesting of restricted stock awards.  There were   862   shares surrendered between   July 3, 2016   and   October 1, 2016  . 
       
           (2) 
    Share purchases during the   third   quarter of fiscal 2016 were made in compliance with all applicable rules and regulations and in accordance with the share repurchase authorizations described in Note 5 to our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
       
           (3) 
    On February 24, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a new $500 million share repurchase program. The new share repurchase authorization permits us to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $500 million, in addition to any amounts remaining under previous authorizations.
