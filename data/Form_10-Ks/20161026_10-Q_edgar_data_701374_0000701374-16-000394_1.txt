Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by words such as "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "seeks," "believes," "estimates," "expects," "may," "should," "could" and variations of such words or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are, by their nature, subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict.

    factors impacting attendance, such as local conditions, contagious diseases, events, disturbances and terrorist activities; 
                
    recall of food, toys and other retail products sold at our parks; 
                
    accidents occurring at our parks or other parks in the industry and adverse publicity concerning our parks or other parks in the industry; 
                
    inability to achieve desired improvements and financial performance targets set forth in our aspirational goals; 
                
    adverse weather conditions such as excess heat or cold, rain and storms; 
                
    general financial and credit market conditions; 
                
    economic conditions (including customer spending patterns); 
                
    changes in public and consumer tastes; 
                
    construction delays in capital improvements or ride downtime; 
                
    competition with other theme parks and entertainment alternatives; 
                
    dependence on a seasonal workforce; 
                
    unionization activities and labor disputes; 
                
    laws and regulations affecting labor and employee benefit costs, including increases in state and federally mandated minimum wages, and healthcare reform; 
                
    pending, threatened or future legal proceedings and the significant expenses associated with litigation; 
                
    cyber security risks; and 
      A more complete discussion of these factors and other risks applicable to our business is contained in "Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors" of the   2015   Annual Report. All forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report, or that are made on our behalf by our directors, officers or employees related to the information contained herein, apply only as of the date of this Quarterly Report or as of the date they were made. While we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that such expectations will be realized and actual results could vary materially. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation, except as required by applicable law, to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.

    General   Basis of Presentation 
     We own and operate regional theme and water parks and are the largest regional theme park operator in the world. Of the   18   parks we currently own or operate,   16   parks are located in the United States,   one   is located in Mexico City, Mexico and   one   is located in Montreal, Canada. We are also involved in the development of Six Flags-branded theme parks outside of North America. 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed, or omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. 
  "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contains a discussion of our results of operations and our financial position and should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes. The   2015   Annual Report includes additional information about us, our operations and our financial position, and should be referred to in conjunction with this Quarterly Report. The information furnished in this Quarterly Report reflects all normal and recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present a fair statement of the results for the periods presented. 
  Results of operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not indicative of the results expected for the full year. In particular, our park operations contribute a substantial majority of their annual revenue during the period from Memorial Day to Labor Day each year, while expenses are incurred year round. 
           a. 
    Consolidated U.S. GAAP Presentation 
     Our accounting policies reflect industry practices and conform to U.S. GAAP. 
  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries. We also consolidate the partnerships that own Six Flags Over Texas ("SFOT") and Six Flags Over Georgia (including Six Flags White Water Atlanta) ("SFOG", and together with SFOT, the "Partnership Parks") as subsidiaries in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, as we have determined that we have the power to direct the activities of those entities that most significantly impact the entities' economic performance and we have the obligation to absorb losses and receive benefits from the entities that can be potentially significant to these entities. The equity interests owned by non-affiliated parties in the Partnership Parks are reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as redeemable noncontrolling interests. See Note   7   for further discussion. 
           b. 
    Income Taxes 
     Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, including net operating loss and other tax carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. We recorded a valuation allowance of   $91.2 million   and   $88.4 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of certain state net operating loss and other tax carryforwards, before they expire. The valuation allowance was based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets were recoverable. Our projected taxable income over the foreseeable future gives us comfort that we will be able to utilize all of our federal net operating loss carryforwards before they expire. 
  In determining the effective tax rate for interim periods, we consider the expected changes in our valuation allowance from current year originating or reversing timing differences between financial accounting and tax purposes and the taxable income or loss expected for the current year. For interim periods, we also account for the tax effect of significant non-recurring items in the period in which they occur as well as changes in the valuation allowance relating to a change in the assessment of the probability of utilization of the deferred income tax assets. 
  Our liability for income taxes is finalized as auditable tax years pass their respective statutes of limitations in the various jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax. However, these jurisdictions may audit prior years for which the statute of limitations is closed for the purpose of making an adjustment to our taxable income in a year for which the statute of limitations  
  
   9 

     Table of Contents  
  Six Flags Entertainment Corporation 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (Unaudited) 

has not closed. Accordingly, taxing authorities of these jurisdictions may audit prior years of the group and its predecessors for the purpose of adjusting net operating loss carryforwards to years for which the statute of limitations has not closed. 
  We classify interest and penalties attributable to income taxes as part of income tax expense. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   no   accrued interest and penalties liability. 
  Because we do not permanently reinvest foreign earnings, United States deferred income taxes have been provided on unremitted foreign earnings to the extent that such foreign earnings are expected to be taxable upon repatriation. 
           c. 
    Long-Lived Assets 
     We review long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of the asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset or group of assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or group of assets. If such assets are not considered to be fully recoverable, any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or group of assets exceeds its respective fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. 
           d. 
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
     We account for derivatives and hedging activities in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 815,   Derivatives and Hedging  . This accounting guidance establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. It requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge for accounting purposes. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative (e.g., gains and losses) depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. 
  We formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk-management objective and our strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to forecasted transactions. We also assess, both at the hedge's inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. 
  Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is effective and that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) until operations are affected by the variability in cash flows of the designated hedged item, at which point they are reclassified to interest expense. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is not designated as a hedge are recorded in other income (expense), net in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations on a current basis. See Note   2   for further discussion. 
           e. 
    Earnings Per Common Share 
     Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income attributable to Holdings' common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income attributable to Holdings' common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and the effect of all dilutive common stock equivalents using the treasury stock method. In periods for which there is a net loss, diluted loss per common share is equal to basic loss per common share, since the effect of including any common stock equivalents would be antidilutive. 
  The computation of diluted earnings per share included the effect of   1,951,000   and   2,270,000   dilutive stock options and restricted shares and excluded the effect of   960,000   and   781,000   antidilutive stock options for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The computation of diluted earnings per share included the effect of   2,116,000   and   2,415,000   dilutive stock options and restricted shares and excluded the effect of   656,000   and   657,000   antidilutive stock options for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  Earnings per common share for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   was calculated as follows:

f. 
    Stock Benefit Plans 
     Pursuant to the Six Flags Entertainment Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Long-Term Incentive Plan"), Holdings may grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, unrestricted stock, deferred stock units, performance and cash-settled awards and dividend equivalent rights ("DERs") to select employees, officers, directors and consultants of Holdings and its affiliates. In May 2015, our stockholders approved an amendment to the Long-Term Incentive Plan that increased the number of shares available for issuance under the Long-Term Incentive Plan by   5,000,000   shares from   28,133,332   shares to   33,133,332   shares. 
  We recognize the fair value of each grant as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period using the graded vesting terms of the respective grant. The fair value of stock option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing valuation model. The fair value of stock, restricted stock units and restricted stock awards is the quoted market price of Holdings' stock on the date of grant. 
  During the year ended December 31, 2011, a performance award was established based on our target to achieve Modified EBITDA of   $500 million   by 2015 (the "2015 Performance Award"). "Modified EBITDA  is defined as the Company s consolidated income from continuing operations: excluding the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles; discontinued operations gains or losses; income tax expense or benefit; restructure costs or recoveries; reorganization items (net); other income or expense; gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt; equity in income or loss of investees; interest expense (net); gain or loss on disposal of assets; gain or loss on the sale of investees; amortization; depreciation; stock-based compensation; and fresh start accounting valuation adjustments. Based on the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, the 2015 Performance Award was issued, resulting in the issuance of   1,511,100   shares and   1,314,000   shares, plus associated DERs, in February 2015 and 2016, respectively. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized a reduction in stock-based compensation expense of   $1.6 million   as a result of the decline in the closing market price of Holdings' common stock on the date of issuance in February 2016 relative to December 31, 2015. 
  During the year ended December 31, 2014, a performance award was established based on our goal to achieve Modified EBITDA of   $600 million   by 2017 (the "2017 Performance Award"). If the target is achieved in 2017, an aggregate payout under this award to key employees would be approximately   2,400,000   shares but could be more or fewer shares depending on the level of achievement and the timing thereof. For the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , it was determined that achievement of the Modified EBITDA performance target is probable by 2017, primarily based on the success of our fall sales campaign for 2017 season passes, memberships and all-season dining pass sales, as well as a growth in deferred revenue along with growth in our business once weather normalized in the second half of the third quarter. As such, in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation, we have accrued   $75.7 million  , plus an additional   $10.1 million   for the associated DERs, for stock-based compensation expense related to the 2017 Performance Award as of   September 30, 2016  . Based on the closing market price of Holdings' common stock on the last trading day of the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , the total unrecognized compensation expense related to the 2017 Performance Award was   $51.2 million  , plus approximately   $6.9 million   for the associated DERs, that will be expensed over the remaining service period. 
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , stock-based compensation expense consisted of the following:

As of   September 30, 2016  , options to purchase approximately   6,070,000   shares of common stock of Holdings and approximately   12,000   shares of restricted stock or restricted stock units were outstanding under the Long-Term Incentive Plan and approximately   2,609,000   shares were available for future grant. 
           g. 
    Revenue Recognition 
     We recognize revenue upon admission into our parks, provision of our services or when products are delivered to our guests. Revenues are presented in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations net of sales taxes collected from our guests and remitted or payable to government taxing authorities. In contrast to our season pass and other multi-use offerings (such as our all-season dining pass program, which enables season pass holders and members to eat lunch and dinner any day they visit the park for one upfront payment) that expire at the end of each operating season, the membership program continues on a month-to-month basis after the initial twelve-month membership term and can be canceled any time after the initial term pursuant to the terms of the membership program. Guests enrolled in the membership program can visit our parks an unlimited number of times anytime they are open as long as the guest remains enrolled in the membership program. For season passes, memberships in the initial twelve-month term and other multi-use admissions, we estimate a redemption rate based on historical experience and other factors and assumptions we believe to be customary and reasonable and recognize a pro-rata portion of the revenue as the guest attends our parks. We review the estimated redemption rate regularly and on an ongoing basis and revise it as necessary throughout the year. Amounts received for multi-use admissions in excess of redemptions are recognized in deferred income. For active memberships after the initial twelve-month term, we recognize revenue monthly as payments are received. As of   September 30, 2016  , deferred income was primarily comprised of (i) unredeemed season pass and all-season dining pass revenue, (ii) pre-sold single-day admissions revenue for the current operating season, (iii) unredeemed portions of the membership program that will be recognized in 2016 and 2017 and (iv) sponsorship revenue that will primarily be recognized in 2016. 
  We have entered into multiple agreements to assist third parties in the planning, design, development and operation of Six Flags-branded theme parks outside of North America. Pursuant to these agreements, we provide exclusivity, brand licensing and other services to assist in the design, development and project management of Six Flags-branded theme parks, as well as initial and ongoing management services. Each significant deliverable qualifies as a separate unit of accounting. We recognize revenue under these agreements over the relevant service period of each unit of accounting based on its relative selling price, as determined by our best estimate of selling price. Our best estimate of selling price is established consistent with our overall pricing strategy and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of current market conditions, various risk factors and our required return and profit objectives. We review the service period of each unit of accounting on an ongoing basis and revise it as necessary throughout the year. Revisions to the relevant service periods of the units of accounting may result in revisions to revenue in future periods and are recognized in the period in which the change is identified. 
           h. 
    Accounts Receivable, Net 
     Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value and consist primarily of amounts due from guests for the sale of group outings and multi-use admission products, including season passes and the membership program. We are not exposed to a significant concentration of credit risk, however, based on the age of the receivables, our historical experience and other factors and assumptions we believe to be customary and reasonable, we record an allowance for doubtful accounts. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we have recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of   $6.2 million   and   $2.4 million  , respectively, which is primarily comprised of estimated defaults under our membership plans. To the extent that our membership plans have not been recognized in revenue, the allowance for doubtful accounts recorded against our membership plans is offset with a corresponding reduction in deferred income.

    Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
     In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ("ASU 2014-09"). The amendments in ASU 2014-09 provide for a single, principles-based model for revenue recognition that replaces the existing revenue recognition guidance. In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Updated 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date  , to defer the effective date of ASU

2014-09 for one year. Therefore, the new guidance will be effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In March and April 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-08 and No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   and   Principal versus Agent Considerations and Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  , respectively (together,  ASU 2016-08/10 ). The amendments in ASU 2016-08/10 state that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in ASU 2016-08/10 are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in ASU 2015-14. It permits the use of either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method and early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. We have not yet selected a transition method and are in the process of evaluating the effect this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-12 ( ASU 2015-12 ),   Plan Accounting: Defined Benefit Pension Plans (Topic 960), Defined Contribution Pension Plans (Topic 962), and Health and Welfare Benefit Plans (Topic 965)  . The amendments in   Part II: Plan Investment Disclosures   of ASU 2015-12 seek to simplify and increase the effectiveness of the required disclosures for investments related to employee benefit plans. The amendments in Part II of ASU 2015-12 will require that investments of employee benefit plans be grouped only by general type, eliminating the need to disaggregate the investments in multiple ways. Part II of ASU 2015-12 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2015, with early application permitted, and should be applied retrospectively for all financial statements presented. We do not anticipate that the adoption of this pronouncement will result in a material impact to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02  , Leases (Topic 842)   ( ASU 2016-02 ). The main amendments in ASU 2016-02 require recognition on the balance sheet of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early application permitted. We have not yet selected a transition method and are in the process of evaluating the effect this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ). The amendments in ASU 2016-09 intend to improve the accounting for share-based payment transactions as part of the FASB s simplification initiative. The areas for simplification in ASU 2016-09 involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early application permitted. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. In conjunction with the adoption of ASU 2016-09, which we plan on adopting in the first quarter of 2017, we anticipate a retrospective adjustment to beginning equity and deferred tax liabilities. Additionally, for periods subsequent to the retrospective adjustment, we anticipate adjustments to previously reported amounts for income tax expense and deferred tax liabilities to account for the recognition of the income tax consequences of share-based payment transactions. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ("ASU 2016-15"). The amendments in ASU 2016-15 address eight classification issues related to the statement of cash flows:  
             
    debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; 
                
    settlement of zero-coupon bonds; 
                
    contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; 
                
    proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; 
                
    proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies; 
                
    distributions received from equity method investees; 
                
    beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and 
                
    separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. 
     ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early application permitted. An entity should apply ASU 2016-15 using a retrospective transition method to each

           2  . 
    Derivative Financial Instruments 
     In April 2014, we entered into   three   separate interest rate swap agreements (collectively, the "Interest Rate Swap Agreements") with an aggregate notional amount of   $200.0 million   to mitigate the risk of an increase in the   LIBOR   interest rate above the   0.75%   minimum LIBOR rate in effect on the Term Loan B. The term of the Interest Rate Swap Agreements began in June 2014 and expires in December 2017. Upon execution, we designated and documented the Interest Rate Swap Agreements as cash flow hedges. The Interest Rate Swap Agreements will continue to mitigate risk in connection with the interest rate for the Amended and Restated Term Loan B (as defined in Note 4). 
  By utilizing a derivative instrument to hedge our exposure to LIBOR rate changes, we are exposed to credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. To mitigate this risk, the hedging instrument is placed with counterparties that we believe pose minimal credit risk. Market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in interest rates, commodity prices or currency exchange rates. We manage the market risk associated with the Interest Rate Swap Agreements by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that we may undertake. We hold and issue derivative instruments for risk management purposes only and do not utilize derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. 
  We record derivative instruments at fair value on our unaudited and audited condensed consolidated balance sheets with the effective portion of all cash flow designated derivatives deferred in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion, if any, recognized immediately in earnings. Our derivatives are measured on a recurring basis using Level 2 inputs. The fair value measurements of our derivatives are based on market prices that generally are observable for similar assets or liabilities at commonly quoted intervals. Derivative assets and derivative liabilities that have maturity dates equal to or less than twelve months from the balance sheet date are included in prepaid and other current assets and other accrued liabilities, respectively. Derivative assets and derivative liabilities that have maturity dates greater than twelve months from the balance sheet date are included in deposits and other assets and other long-term liabilities, respectively. 
  Derivative instruments recorded at fair value in our unaudited and audited condensed consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, consisted of the following: 

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we held   no   derivatives other than derivatives designated as hedging instruments. 
  Effective changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") on the condensed consolidated balance sheet when in qualifying relationships and are reclassified to interest expense when the forecasted transaction takes place. Ineffective changes, if any, and changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recorded directly in interest expense and other (income) expense, net, respectively. 
  Gains and losses before taxes on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges included in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   were as follows:

Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015    

Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015    

As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $1.3 million   of unrealized losses associated with the Interest Rate Swap Agreements are expected to be reclassified from AOCI to operations during the next twelve months. Transactions and events expected to occur over the next twelve months that will necessitate reclassifying these unrealized losses to operations are the periodic interest payments that are required to be made on the Amended and Restated Term Loan B. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , no hedge ineffectiveness was recorded for the Interest Rate Swap Agreements. 
   
           3  . 
    Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
     The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. The following table and accompanying information present the estimated fair values and classifications of our financial instruments in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820,   Fair Value Measurement  , as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments: 
             
    The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. 
                
    Restricted-use investment securities consist of interest bearing bank accounts for which their carrying value approximates their fair value because of their short term maturity. The measurement of restricted-use investment securities is considered a Level 2 fair value measurement. 
                
    The measurement of the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities is based on market prices that generally are observable for similar assets and liabilities at commonly quoted intervals and is considered a Level 2 fair value measurement. Derivative assets and liabilities that have maturity dates equal to or less than twelve months from the balance sheet date are included in prepaid and other current assets and other accrued liabilities, respectively. Derivative assets and liabilities that have maturity dates greater than twelve months from the balance sheet date are included in deposits and other assets and other long-term liabilities, respectively. See Note   2   for additional information on our derivative instruments and related Company policies.

    Long-Term Indebtedness 
     Credit Facility 
  On December 20, 2011, we entered into a   $1,135.0 million   credit agreement (the "2011 Credit Facility") with several lenders including Wells Fargo Bank National Association, as administrative agent, and related loan and security documentation agents. The 2011 Credit Facility was comprised of a   5  -year   $200.0 million   revolving credit loan facility (the "Revolving Loan"), a   5  -year   $75.0 million   Tranche A Term Loan facility ("Term Loan A") and a   7  -year   $860.0 million   Tranche B Term Loan facility ("Term Loan B" and together with the Term Loan A, the "Term Loans"). In certain circumstances, the Term Loan B could be increased by   $300.0 million  . The proceeds from the   $935.0 million   Term Loans were used, along with   $15.0 million   of existing cash, to retire the   $950.0 million   senior term loan from the prior facility. Interest on the 2011 Credit Facility accrued based on pricing rates corresponding with the senior secured leverage ratios of Six Flags Theme Parks Inc. ("SFTP") as set forth in the credit agreement. 
  On December 21, 2012, we entered into an amendment to the 2011 Credit Facility (the "2012 Credit Facility Amendment") that among other things, permitted us to (i) issue   $800.0 million   of senior unsecured notes (see   2021 Notes   below), (ii) use   $350.0 million   of the proceeds of the senior unsecured notes to repay the   $72.2 million   that was outstanding under the Term Loan A and   $277.8 million   of the outstanding balance of the Term Loan B, (iii) use the remaining   $450.0 million   of proceeds for share repurchases and other corporate matters and (iv) reduce the interest rate payable on the Term Loan B by   25   basis points. 
  On December 23, 2013, we entered into an amendment to the 2011 Credit Facility (the "2013 Credit Facility Amendment") that reduced the overall borrowing rate on the Term Loan B by   50   basis points through (i) a   25   basis point reduction in the applicable margin from   3.00%   plus   LIBOR   to   2.75%   plus   LIBOR   and (ii) a   25   basis point reduction in the minimum LIBOR rate from   1.00%   to   0.75%  . Additionally, the 2013 Credit Facility Amendment permitted us to use up to   $200.0 million   of our excess cash on hand, over time, for general corporate purposes, including potential share repurchases.  
  On June 30, 2015, we amended and restated the 2011 Credit Facility (as amended by the 2012 Credit Facility Amendment and the 2013 Credit Facility Amendment, the "Amended and Restated Credit Facility"). The Amended and Restated Credit Facility is comprised of a   $250.0 million   revolving credit loan facility (the "Amended and Restated Revolving Loan") and a   $700.0 million   Tranche B Term Loan facility (the "Amended and Restated Term Loan B"). In connection with entering into the Amended and Restated Credit Facility, we fully repaid the outstanding Term Loan B and we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of   $6.6 million  . The remaining proceeds from the Amended and Restated Credit Facility were used for share repurchases and payment of refinancing fees. 
  On June 16, 2016, we entered into an amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Facility that reduced the overall borrowing rate on the Amended and Restated Term Loan B by   25   basis points through a reduction in the applicable margin from   2.75%   plus   LIBOR   to   2.50%   plus   LIBOR  . We capitalized $  1.0 million   of debt issuance costs directly associated with the issuance of this amendment. Additionally, we used   $150.0 million   of the proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 Notes discussed below to reduce our borrowings under the Amended and Restated Term Loan B and recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of   $2.4 million  . The paydown of borrowings under the Amended and Restated Term Loan B will eliminate any required quarterly amortization payments thereunder until its final maturity on June 30, 2022. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   no   amounts under the Amended and Restated Revolving Loan were outstanding (excluding amounts reserved for letters of credit in the amount of   $19.7 million   and   $20.1 million  , respectively). Interest on the Amended and Restated Revolving Loan accrues at an   annual   rate of   LIBOR   plus an applicable margin with an unused commitment fee based on our senior secured leverage ratio. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Amended and Restated Revolving Loan unused commitment fee was   0.375%  . The principal amount of the Amended and Restated Revolving Loan is due and payable on June 30, 2020. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $544.8 million   and   $696.5 million   was outstanding under the Amended and Restated Term Loan B, respectively. Interest on the Amended and Restated Term Loan B accrues at an   annual   rate of   LIBOR   plus an applicable margin, with a   0.75%   LIBOR floor, based on our consolidated leverage ratio. In April 2014, we entered into the Interest Rate Swap Agreements with a notional amount of   $200.0 million   to mitigate the risk of an increase in the LIBOR interest rate above the   0.75%   minimum LIBOR rate in effect on the Term Loan B. The Interest Rate Swap Agreements continue to mitigate an increase in the LIBOR rate in effect on the Amended and Restated Term Loan B. See Note

2   for further discussion. As of   September 30, 2016  , the applicable interest rate on the Amended and Restated Term Loan B was   3.31%  . The Amended and Restated Term Loan B was payable in equal   quarterly   installments of   $1.8 million  , but the   $150.0 million   prepayment with proceeds from the 2024 Notes discussed below was applied to the quarterly amortization payments and eliminated the future quarterly amortization payments until maturity. The outstanding principal of the Amended and Restated Term Loan B is due and payable on June 30, 2022. 
  Amounts outstanding under the Amended and Restated Credit Facility are guaranteed by Holdings, Six Flags Operations Inc. ("SFO") and certain of the domestic subsidiaries of SFTP (collectively, the "Loan Parties"). The Amended and Restated Credit Facility is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Loan Parties. The Amended and Restated Credit Facility agreement contains certain representations, warranties, affirmative covenants and financial covenants (specifically, (i) a minimum interest coverage covenant and (ii) a maximum senior leverage maintenance covenant). In addition, the Amended and Restated Credit Facility agreement contains restrictive covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, limit or restrict, among other things, the incurrence of indebtedness and liens, fundamental changes, restricted payments, capital expenditures, investments, prepayments of certain indebtedness, transactions with affiliates, changes in fiscal periods, modifications of certain documents, activities of the Company and SFO and hedging agreements, subject, in each case, to certain carve-outs. 
  2021 Notes and 2024 Notes 
  On December 21, 2012, Holdings issued   $800.0 million   of   5.25%   senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2021 (the "2021 Notes"). The proceeds from the 2021 Notes were used to repay the   $72.2 million   that was outstanding under the Term Loan A and to repay   $277.8 million   of the outstanding balance of the Term Loan B. The remaining proceeds were used for share repurchases. Interest payments of   $21.0 million   are due   semi-annual  ly on January 15 and July 15 (except in 2013 when we only made one interest payment of   $22.3 million   on July 15 and in 2021 when we will only make one payment of   $21.0 million   on January 15). 
  On June 16, 2016, Holdings issued   $300.0 million   of   4.875%   senior unsecured notes due July 31, 2024 (the "2024 Notes"). We capitalized   $4.7 million   of debt issuance costs directly associated with the issuance of the 2024 Notes. We used approximately   $150.0 million   of the proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 Notes to reduce our borrowings under the Amended and Restated Term Loan B. We intend to use the remaining net proceeds of the sale of the 2024 Notes for general corporate and working capital purposes, which we expect to primarily include repurchases of our common stock from time to time, subject to compliance with our financing agreements, and to the extent we do not use such net proceeds for that purpose, we may use such amounts for strategic initiatives that we may undertake from time to time. Interest payments of   $7.3 million   are due   semi-annually   on January 31 and July 31 of each year, with the exception of the first payment on January 31, 2017, which will be approximately   $9.1 million  .  
  The 2021 Notes and 2024 Notes are guaranteed by the Loan Parties. The 2021 Notes and 2024 Notes contain restrictive covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, limit or restrict, among other things, the ability of the Loan Parties to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, engage in mergers, consolidations and other fundamental changes, make investments, engage in transactions with affiliates, pay dividends and repurchase capital stock. The 2021 Notes and 2024 Notes contain certain events of default, including payment, breaches of covenants and representations, cross defaults to other material indebtedness, judgment, and changes of control and bankruptcy events of default. 
  HWP Refinance Loan 
  On November 5, 2007, HWP Development LLC ("HWP") entered into a   $33.0 million   term loan (the "Refinance Loan"). Borrowings under the Refinance Loan bear interest at   6.72%  .   Monthly   payments of principal and interest of   $0.2 million   are payable through November 1, 2017. On December 1, 2017, all unpaid principal and interest is due and payable. Due to significant early pre-payment penalties under the Refinance Loan, we do not currently intend to pre-pay the Refinance Loan prior to its scheduled maturity. HWP is subject to various covenants under the Refinance Loan that place certain restrictions limiting or prohibiting engaging in certain types of transactions. Pursuant to the Refinance Loan, HWP deposited into escrow   $3.8 million   and   $3.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and will make additional monthly deposits to cover annual amounts owed for insurance, taxes and furniture, fixture and equipment purchases.

    Commitments and Contingencies 
     Partnership Parks 
  On April 1, 1998, we acquired all of the capital stock of the former Six Flags Entertainment Corporation (a corporation that has been merged out of existence and that has always been a separate corporation from Holdings, "Former SFEC") for   $976.0 million  , paid in cash. In addition to our obligations under outstanding indebtedness and other securities issued or assumed in the Former SFEC acquisition, we also guaranteed certain contractual obligations relating to the Partnership Parks. Specifically, we guaranteed the obligations of the general partners of those partnerships to (i) make minimum annual distributions (including rent) of approximately   $68.3 million   in   2016   (subject to cost of living adjustments) to the limited partners in the Partnership Parks (based on our ownership of units as of   September 30, 2016  , our share of the distribution will be approximately   $29.8 million  ) and (ii) make minimum capital expenditures at each of the Partnership Parks during rolling   five  -year periods, based generally on   6%   of the Partnership Parks' revenues. Cash flow from operations at the Partnership Parks is used to satisfy these requirements first, before any funds are required from us. We also guaranteed the obligation of our subsidiaries to annually purchase all outstanding limited partnership units to the extent tendered by the unit holders (the "Partnership Park Put"). The agreed price for units tendered in the Partnership Park Put is based on a valuation of each of the respective Partnership Parks (the "Specified Price") that is the greater of (a) a valuation for each of the respective Partnership Parks derived by multiplying such park's weighted average   four   year EBITDA (as defined in the agreements that govern the partnerships) by a specified multiple (  8.0   in the case of SFOG and   8.5   in the case of SFOT) and (b) a valuation derived from the highest prices previously paid for the units of the Partnership Parks by certain entities. Pursuant to the valuation methodologies described in the preceding sentence, the Specified Price for the Partnership Parks, if determined as of   September 30, 2016   is   $343.0 million   in the case of SFOG and   $392.5 million   in the case of SFOT. As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned approximately   31.0%   and   53.1%   of the Georgia limited partner interests and Texas limited partner interests, respectively. Our obligations with respect to SFOG and SFOT will continue until 2027 and 2028, respectively. 
  In 2027 and 2028, we will have the option to purchase all remaining units in the Georgia limited partner and the Texas limited partner, respectively, at a price based on the Specified Price, increased by a cost of living adjustment. Pursuant to the 2016 annual offer, we did not purchase any units from the Texas partnership and we purchased   0.065   units from the Georgia partnership for approximately   $0.2 million   in May 2016. Pursuant to the   2015   annual offer, we did not purchase any units from the Texas partnership and we purchased   0.500   units from the Georgia partnership for approximately   $1.6 million   in May 2015. As we purchase additional units, we are entitled to a proportionate increase in our share of the minimum annual distributions. The maximum unit purchase obligations for 2017 at both parks will be approximately   $420.7 million  , representing approximately   69.0%   of the outstanding units of SFOG and   46.9%   of the outstanding units of SFOT. An additional   $350.0 million   of the Amended and Restated Term Loan B under the Amended and Restated Credit Facility is available for borrowing for future "put" obligations, if necessary. 
  In connection with our acquisition of the Former SFEC, we entered into the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement with certain of the Company's entities, Time Warner and an affiliate of Time Warner, pursuant to which, among other things, we transferred to Time Warner (which has guaranteed all of our obligations under the Partnership Park arrangements) record title to the corporations which own the entities that have purchased and will purchase limited partnership units of the Partnership Parks, and we received an assignment from Time Warner of all cash flow received on such limited partnership units, and we otherwise control such entities. In addition, we issued preferred stock of the managing partner of the partnerships to Time Warner. In the event of a default by us under the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement or of our obligations to our partners in the Partnership Parks, these arrangements would permit Time Warner to take full control of both the entities that own limited partnership units and the managing partner. If we satisfy all such obligations, Time Warner is required to transfer to us the entire equity interests of these entities. 
  We incurred   $14.8 million   of capital expenditures at these parks during the   2015   season and intend to incur approximately   $26.0 million   of capital expenditures at these parks for the   2016   season, an amount in excess of the minimum required expenditure. Cash flows from operations at the Partnership Parks will be used to satisfy the annual distribution and capital expenditure requirements, before any funds are required from us. The Partnership Parks generated approximately   $79.8 million   of cash in 2015 from operating activities after deduction of capital expenditures and excluding the impact of short-term intercompany advances from or payments to Holdings. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had total loans receivable outstanding of   $239.3 million   from the partnerships that own the Partnership Parks, primarily to fund the acquisition of Six Flags White Water Atlanta and to make capital improvements and distributions to the limited partners in prior years.

Insurance 
  We maintain insurance of the types and in amounts that we believe are commercially reasonable and that are available to businesses in our industry. We maintain multi-layered general liability policies that provide for excess liability coverage of up to   $100.0 million   per occurrence. For incidents arising after November 15, 2003 but prior to December 31, 2008, our self-insured retention is   $2.5 million   per occurrence (  $2.0 million   per occurrence for the twelve months ended November 15, 2003 and   $1.0 million   per occurrence for the twelve months ended November 15, 2002) for our domestic parks and a nominal amount per occurrence for our international parks. For incidents arising after November 1, 2004 but prior to December 31, 2008, we have a one-time additional   $0.5 million   self-insured retention, in the aggregate, applicable to all claims in the policy year. For incidents arising on or after December 31, 2008, our self-insured retention is   $2.0 million  , followed by a   $0.5 million   deductible per occurrence applicable to all claims in the policy year for our domestic parks and our park in Canada and a nominal amount per occurrence for our park in Mexico. Defense costs are in addition to these retentions. Our general liability policies cover the cost of punitive damages only in certain jurisdictions. Based upon reported claims and an estimate for incurred, but not reported claims, we accrue a liability for our self-insured contingencies. For workers' compensation claims arising after November 15, 2003, our deductible is   $0.75 million   (  $0.5 million   deductible for the period from November 15, 2001 to November 15, 2003). We also maintain fire and extended coverage, business interruption, terrorism and other forms of insurance typical to businesses in this industry. The all peril property coverage policies insure our real and personal properties (other than land) against physical damage resulting from a variety of hazards. Additionally, we maintain information security and privacy liability insurance in the amount of   $10.0 million   with a   $0.25 million   self-insured retention per event. 
  The majority of our current insurance policies expire on December 31, 2016. We generally renegotiate our insurance policies on an annual basis. We cannot predict the level of the premiums that we may be required to pay for subsequent insurance coverage, the level of any self-insurance retention applicable thereto, the level of aggregate coverage available or the availability of coverage for specific risks. 
  Litigation 
  We are party to various legal actions arising in the normal course of business, including the cases discussed below. Matters that are probable of unfavorable outcome to us and which can be reasonably estimated are accrued. Such accruals are based on information known about the matters, our estimate of the outcomes of such matters and our experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters.   None   of the actions are believed by management to involve amounts that would be material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity after consideration of recorded accruals. 
  On January 6, 2009, a civil action against us was commenced in the State Court of Cobb County, Georgia. The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries, including an alleged brain injury, as a result of an altercation with a group of individuals on property adjacent to SFOG on July 3, 2007. Certain of the individuals were employees of the park, but were off-duty and not acting within the course or scope of their employment with SFOG at the time the altercation occurred. The plaintiff, who had exited the park, claimed that we were negligent in our security of the premises.   Four   of the individuals who allegedly participated in the altercation were also named as defendants in the litigation. Our motion for summary judgment was denied by the trial court on May 19, 2011. Pursuant to the trial that concluded on November 20, 2013, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for   $35.0 million  . The jury allocated   92%   of the verdict against Six Flags and the judgment was entered on February 11, 2014. A notice of appeal was filed on September 19, 2014, which our insurers are pursuing on Six Flags' and the insurers' behalf, and on October 2, 2014, the plaintiff filed a notice of cross appeal. On November 20, 2015, the Georgia Court of Appeals reversed the jury verdict and remanded for a new trial on both liability and damages. On December 16, 2015, the Georgia Court of Appeals denied the parties  various motions for reconsideration. A petition for writ of certiorari in the Georgia Supreme Court was filed on behalf of Six Flags on January 19, 2016. The Six Flags petition asks the Georgia Supreme Court to grant further review and rule that Six Flags is entitled to judgment as a matter of law without the need for a new trial. On January 19, 2016, the plaintiff also filed a petition for writ of certiorari asking the Georgia Supreme Court to review the Court of Appeals  reversal of the jury verdict. On September 6, 2016, the Georgia Supreme Court granted both parties' certiorari petitions. We have paid the full amount of our   $2.5 million   self-insurance retention to our insurers. 
  On June 27, 2012, Wishtoyo Foundation and its Ventura Coastkeeper program, Los Angeles Coastkeeper d/b/a Santa Monica Baykeeper, and Friends of the Santa Clara River, all non-profit corporations, filed a complaint against Holdings, SFTP and Magic Mountain LLC in the United States District Court for the Central District of California seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and civil penalties under, among others, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (more commonly known as the Clean Water Act). The plaintiffs alleged that Six Flags Magic Mountain discharged water in violation of its water discharge permits into the Santa Clara River. In January 2015, the parties to the lawsuit entered into a consent decree to settle the lawsuit, and on March 26, 2015, the consent decree was approved and entered by the District Court. In connection with settlement of the

lawsuit, we intend to install at Six Flags Magic Mountain an on-site infiltration basin to retain, manage and infiltrate stormwater runoff from the park in certain instances. 
  On July 3, 2012, a civil action was commenced against us in the Superior Court of Solano County, California. The plaintiffs sought damages for personal injuries when a guest at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom jumped on a swinging gate arm that entered a passing tram carrying the plaintiffs on July 3, 2010. We have previously expensed the full amount of our   $2.5 million   self-insurance retention plus estimated litigation costs in connection with this incident. On October 24, 2014, the litigation was dismissed without prejudice, with respect to   one   of the plaintiffs, a minor, who may reinstate the lawsuit at any time prior to   2   years following the date such plaintiff reaches the age of majority. In January 2015, an agreement was reached to settle the lawsuit with the remaining plaintiffs. 
  On September 12, 2014, a civil action against us was commenced in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois.  The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries after riding a water slide at Six Flags Great America. In 2015, the venue for the action was transferred to Lake County. Pursuant to the trial that concluded on April 26, 2016, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for   $1.5 million  . We intend to vigorously challenge the verdict and in May 2016 we filed a post-trial motion to vacate the jury verdict. 
  On January 7, 2016, a potential class action complaint was filed against Six Flags Entertainment Corporation in the Circuit Court of Lake County, Illinois. On April 22, 2016, Great America, LLC was added as a defendant. The complaint asserts that we violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act in connection with the admission of season pass holders and members through the finger scan program at Six Flags Great America in Gurnee, Illinois, and seeks statutory damages, attorneys fees and an injunction. The program commenced at the park in the 2014 operating season. The complaint does not allege that any information was misused or disseminated. On June 17, 2016, the court denied our motion to dismiss, and allowed the case to proceed, however we intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves against this litigation. Since this litigation is still in an early stage, the outcome is currently not determinable and a reasonable estimate of loss or range of loss in excess of the immaterial amount that we have recorded for this litigation cannot be made. 
  Tax and Other Contingencies 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had a nominal amount of accrued liabilities for tax and other indemnification contingencies related to certain parks sold in previous years that could be recognized as recovery of losses in the future if such liabilities are not requested to be paid.

    Noncontrolling Interests, Partnerships and Joint Ventures 
     Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests 
  Redeemable noncontrolling interests represent the non-affiliated parties' share of the assets of the Partnership Parks that are less than wholly-owned: SFOT, SFOG and Six Flags White Water Atlanta, which is owned by the partnership that owns SFOG. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , redeemable noncontrolling interests in the Partnership Parks was   $454.7 million   and   $435.7 million  , respectively. 
  The following table presents a rollforward of redeemable noncontrolling interests in the Partnership Parks:    

  See Note   6   for a description of the partnership arrangements applicable to the Partnership Parks, the accounts of which are included in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The redemption value of the partnership units as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was approximately   $420.7 million   and   $420.9 million  , respectively.

We manage our operations on an individual park location basis, including operations from parks owned, managed and branded. Discrete financial information is maintained for each park and provided to our corporate management for review and as a basis for decision making. The primary performance measure used to allocate resources is Park EBITDA (defined as park-related operating earnings, excluding the impact of interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and any other non-cash income or expenditures). Primarily all of our parks provide similar products and services through a similar process to the same class of customer through a consistent method. We also believe that the parks share common economic characteristics. Based on these factors, we have only   one   reportable segment theme parks.  
  The following table presents segment financial information and a reconciliation of net income to Park EBITDA. Park level expenses exclude all non-cash operating expenses, principally depreciation and amortization and all non-operating expenses. 

All of our owned or managed parks are located in the United States with the exception of   one   park in Mexico City, Mexico and   one   park in Montreal, Canada. We also have revenue and expenses related to the development of Six Flags-branded theme parks outside of North America. The following information reflects our long-lived assets (which consists of property and equipment and intangible assets), revenues and income before income taxes by domestic and foreign categories as of or for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  :

    Stock Repurchase Plans 
     On November 20, 2013, Holdings announced that its Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program that permitted Holdings to repurchase up to   $500.0 million   in shares of Holdings' common stock over a   four  -year period (the "November 2013 Stock Repurchase Plan"). Holdings utilized the remaining availability under the November 2013 Stock Repurchase Plan in August 2016. Throughout the program, Holdings repurchased   11,428,000   shares at a cumulative price of approximately   $500.0 million   and an average price per share of   $43.75  . 
  On June 7, 2016, Holdings announced that its Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program that permits Holdings to repurchase an incremental   $500.0 million   in shares of Holdings' common stock (the "June 2016 Stock Repurchase Plan"). As of   October 21, 2016  , Holdings had repurchased   1,202,000   shares at a cumulative price of approximately   $65.7 million   and an average price per share of   $54.68   under the June 2016 Stock Repurchase Plan, leaving approximately   $434.3 million   available for permitted repurchases. 
  The timing of share repurchases is limited by the covenants in the Amended and Restated Credit Facility, the 2021 Notes and the 2024 Notes. We will continue to evaluate the share repurchase limits per the covenants on an on-going basis to determine our ability to utilize the remaining amount authorized for share repurchases.

The following discussion and analysis presents information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated financial position and results of operations. This information should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, and other financial data included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. The following information should also be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our   2015   Annual Report. 
   
  Overview 
  General 
  We are the largest regional theme park operator in the world based on the number of parks we operate. Of our 18 regional theme and water parks, 16 are located in the United States, one is located in Mexico City, Mexico and one is located in Montreal, Canada. Our parks are located in geographically diverse markets across North America and they generally offer a broad selection of state-of-the-art and traditional thrill rides, water attractions, themed areas, concerts and shows, restaurants, game venues and retail outlets, thereby providing a complete family-oriented entertainment experience. We work continuously to improve our parks and our guests' experiences and to meet our guests' evolving needs and preferences. 
  The results of operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   are not indicative of the results expected for the full year. In particular, our park operations generate a significant majority of their annual revenue during the period from Memorial Day to Labor Day each year while expenses are incurred year round. 
  Our revenue is primarily derived from (i) the sale of tickets for entrance to our parks (which accounted for approximately   54%   and   55%   of total revenues during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively), (ii) the sale of food and beverages, merchandise, games and attractions, parking and other services inside our parks, (iii) sponsorship, licensing and other fees, including revenue earned under international development contracts, and (iv) accommodations revenue. Revenues from ticket sales and in park sales are primarily impacted by park attendance. Revenues from sponsorship, licensing and other fees can be impacted by the term, timing and extent of services and fees under these arrangements, which can result in fluctuations from year to year. During the first   nine   months of 2016, our park earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("Park EBITDA") improved primarily as a result of revenue growth, partially offset by an increase in cash operating costs. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by a   2%   increase in attendance coupled with a   1%   increase in total revenue per capita (representing total revenue divided by total attendance), partially offset by the negative foreign currency impact related to the weaker Mexican Peso and Canadian Dollar. Our cash operating costs increased primarily as a result of (i) an increase in salary and wage expenses, driven by statutory and market-based wage rate increases, (ii) an increase in credit card processing fees and operating taxes related to our increased revenue and (iii) an increase in insurance and international development costs. These increases were partially offset by savings in advertising and other operating costs as well as the continued weakening of the Mexican Peso and Canadian Dollar, which favorably impacts expenses. 
  Our principal costs of operations include salaries and wages, employee benefits, advertising, third party services, repairs and maintenance, utilities and insurance. A large portion of our expenses is relatively fixed as our costs for full-time employees, maintenance, utilities, advertising and insurance do not vary significantly with attendance. 
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses earned and incurred during the reporting period. Critical accounting estimates are fundamental to the portrayal of both our financial condition and results of operations and often require difficult, subjective and complex estimates and judgments. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in these estimates resulting from the continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods. With respect to our critical accounting policies and estimates, there have been no material developments or changes from the policies and estimates discussed in our   2015   Annual Report. 
  Recent Events

On July 20, 2016, we announced that we signed a letter agreement with our existing partner to potentially develop a second Six Flags-branded theme park, together with a water park, in China. 

Results of Operations 
  Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
  The following table sets forth summary financial information for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  : 

Revenue 
  Revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   totaled   $557.6 million  , a decrease of   $17.7 million  , or   3%  , compared to   $575.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in revenue is primarily attributable to a   2%   decrease in attendance primarily related to the adverse impact of unfavorable weather in July and early August coupled with a 1% decrease in total revenue per capita, calculated as total revenue divided by attendance. Per capita guest spending, which excludes sponsorship, licensing, Six Flags Great Escape Lodge   Indoor Waterpark accommodations and other fees, decreased to   $42.23   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $42.87   during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Per capita guest spending was adversely impacted by (i) a substantially higher mix of season pass holder and member attendance, which put downward pressure on per capita spending, and (ii) the continued weakening of the Mexican Peso and the Canadian Dollar. 
  Admissions revenue per capita decreased   $0.50  , or   2%  , during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   relative to the comparable period in the prior year. The decrease in admissions revenue per capita was primarily driven by the substantially higher mix of season pass holder and member attendance and the continued weakening of the Mexican Peso and Canadian Dollar. On a constant currency basis, admissions revenue per capita decreased $0.40 or 2%. Non-admissions revenue per capita decreased   $0.14   or   1%   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   relative to the comparable period in the prior year, primarily as a result of the higher percentage of season pass holder and member attendance previously discussed and the adverse impact of the weakened Mexican Peso and Canadian Dollar. On a constant currency basis, non-admissions revenue per capita decreased $0.04, or less than 1%, during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
  Operating Expenses 
  Operating expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   $1.6 million  , or   1%  , relative to the comparable period in the prior year, primarily as a result of a decrease in salaries, wages and benefits along with the continued  
  
   25 

     Table of Contents  

weakening of the Mexican Peso and Canadian Dollar, which favorably impacted operating expenses. These savings were partially offset by increases in operating taxes, credit card processing fees and outside professional services.  
  Selling, general and administrative expenses 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $72.2 million  , or   117%  , compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of (i) a net increase in incentive based compensation expense resulting primarily from the 2017 Performance Award, which we began recognizing and accruing during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as achievement of this award is now deemed probable, (ii) an increase in salaries, wages and benefits and (iii) an increase in expenses related to our growing international development operations. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in advertising costs and the continued weakening of the Mexican Peso and Canadian Dollar, which favorably impacted expenses. 
  Cost of products sold 
  Cost of products sold in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $0.8 million  , or   2%  , compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to increased food and merchandise sales. Cost of products sold as a percentage of non-admissions revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   increased relative to the comparable period in the prior year, primarily as a result of product mix including the increase in our all-season dining pass program. 
  Depreciation and amortization expense 
  Depreciation and amortization expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $1.0 million  , or   4%  , compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of asset additions made in conjunction with our ongoing capital program. 
  Loss on disposal of assets 
  Loss on disposal of assets for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   $1.2 million   compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily as a result of a gain recognized on the sale of underutilized assets in the current year. 
  Interest expense, net 
  Interest expense, net increased   $2.0 million  , or   10%  , for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   relative to the comparable period in the prior year as a result of the incremental interest incurred on a higher debt balance resulting from the increased borrowings under the Amended and Restated Revolving Loan and the 2024 Notes. 
  Income Tax Expense 
  Income tax expense was   $55.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $92.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The change in income tax expense is primarily the result of a reduction of income before income taxes resulting from the recognition of 2017 Performance Award in the quarter.

Results of Operations 
  Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015 
  The following table sets forth summary financial information for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  : 

Revenue 
  Revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   totaled   $1,080.1 million  , an increase of   $33.6 million  , or   3%  , compared to   $1,046.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to (i) a   2%   increase in attendance driven by strong season pass and membership sales coupled with a   1%   increase in total revenue per capita, calculated as total revenue divided by total attendance. Per capita guest spending, which excludes sponsorship, licensing, Six Flags Great Escape Lodge   Indoor Waterpark accommodations and other fees, increased to   $42.58   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $42.43   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in per capita guest spending was primarily driven by (i) the continued success of our all-season dining pass, (ii) modest ticket price increases on all ticket types and (iii) post-twelve month ongoing membership payments. These increases were partially offset by a higher mix of season pass and member attendance and the continued weakening of the Mexican Peso and Canadian Dollar. 
  Admissions revenue per capita increased   $0.06  , during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   relative to the comparable period in the prior year. The increase in admissions revenue per capita was primarily driven by ticket price increases on all ticket types and membership revenue for memberships past the initial twelve-month term during which time members continue to pay their membership fees on a month-to-month basis, partially offset by a higher mix of season pass and membership attendance and the continued weakening of the Mexican Peso and Canadian Dollar. On a constant currency basis, admissions revenue per capita increased $0.24, or 1%. Non-admissions revenue per capita increased   $0.09   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   relative to the comparable period in the prior year, primarily as a result of an increase in food and beverage sales driven by the continued success of our all-season dining pass, partially offset by the continued weakening of the Mexican Peso and Canadian Dollar. On a constant currency basis, non-admissions revenue per capita increased $0.27, or 2%.

Operating Expenses 
  Operating expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $18.5 million  , or   5%  , relative to the comparable period in the prior year, primarily as a result of increases in statutory and market-based wage rates as well as an increase in credit card processing fees and operating taxes related to our increased revenue. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in utility and other operating costs, as well as the continued weakening of the Mexican Peso and Canadian Dollar, which favorably impacted expenses. 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $57.2 million  , or   33%  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of (i) a net increase in incentive based compensation expense resulting primarily from the 2017 Performance Award, which we began recognizing and accruing during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as achievement of this award is now deemed probable, (ii) an increase in insurance costs and (iii) an increase in expenses related to our growing international development business. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in advertising costs, as well as the continued weakening of the Mexican Peso and Canadian Dollar, which favorably impacted expenses. 
  Cost of products sold 
  Cost of products sold in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $5.6 million  , or   7%  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of the increase in food and merchandise sales. Cost of products sold as a percentage of non-admissions revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased relative to the comparable period in the prior year, primarily as a result of product mix including the increase in our all-season dining pass program. 
  Depreciation and amortization expense 
  Depreciation and amortization expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $0.6 million  , or   1%  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily the result of asset additions made in conjunction with our ongoing capital program. 
  Loss on disposal of assets 
  Loss on disposal of assets for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   $3.3 million  , primarily as a result of the sale of underutilized assets in the current year, coupled with the disposal of fewer assets in conjunction with the execution of our ongoing capital program during the current year relative to the prior year. 
  Interest expense, net 
  Interest expense, net increased   $4.1 million  , or   7%  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   relative to the comparable period in the prior year as a result of the incremental interest incurred on a higher debt balance resulting from the increased borrowings under the Amended and Restated Revolving Loan and to a lesser degree the 2024 Notes. 
  Loss on debt extinguishment 
  On June 16, 2016, Holdings issued $300.0 million of   4.875%   senior unsecured notes. We used $150.0 million of the proceeds from the issuance of the notes to reduce our borrowings under the Amended and Restated Term Loan and we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of   $2.4 million  . See Note   4   to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for further discussion. 
  Income Tax Expense  
  Income tax expense was   $72.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to an income tax expense of   $84.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The change in income tax expense is primarily the result of a decrease in income before income taxes. 
   
  Liquidity, Capital Commitments and Resources 
  On an annual basis, our principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations, funds from borrowings and existing cash on hand. Our principal uses of cash include the funding of working capital obligations, debt service, investments in parks (including capital projects), common stock dividends, payments to our partners in the Partnership Parks and common stock repurchases.

In November 2015, Holdings' Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend from $0.52 per share of common stock to $0.58 per share of common stock. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , Holdings paid   $161.5 million   and   $147.9 million  , respectively, in cash dividends on its common stock. The amount and timing of any future dividends payable on Holdings' common stock are within the sole discretion of Holdings' Board of Directors. Based on (i) the dividends per share authorized by Holdings' Board of Directors, (ii) the current number of shares of Holdings' common stock outstanding and (iii) estimates of share repurchases, restricted stock vesting and option exercises, we currently anticipate paying approximately   $215.0 million   in total cash dividends on our common stock for the 2016 calendar year. 
  On November 20, 2013, Holdings announced that its Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program that permitted Holdings to repurchase up to   $500.0 million   in shares of Holdings' common stock over a four-year period (the "November 2013 Stock Repurchase Plan"). Holdings utilized the remaining availability under the November 2013 Stock Repurchase Plan in August of 2016. Throughout the program, Holdings repurchased   11,428,000   shares at a cumulative price of approximately   $500.0 million   and an average price per share of   $43.75  . 
  On June 7, 2016, Holdings announced that its Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program that permits Holdings to repurchase an incremental   $500.0 million   in shares of Holdings' common stock (the "June 2016 Stock Repurchase Plan"). As of   October 21, 2016  , Holdings had repurchased   1,202,000   shares at a cumulative price of approximately   $65.7 million   and an average price per share of   $54.68   under the June 2016 Stock Repurchase Plan, leaving approximately   $434.3 million   available for permitted repurchases. 
  Based on historical and anticipated operating results, we believe that cash flows from operations, available unrestricted cash and amounts available under the Amended and Restated Credit Facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs, including any anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, common stock dividends, scheduled debt service, obligations under arrangements relating to the Partnership Parks and discretionary common stock repurchases. Additionally, based on our current federal net operating loss carryforwards, we believe we will continue to pay minimal United States cash taxes for the next three years. 
  Our current and future liquidity is greatly dependent upon our operating results, which are driven largely by overall economic conditions as well as the price and perceived quality of the entertainment experience at our parks. Our liquidity could also be adversely affected by a disruption in the availability of credit as well as unfavorable weather, contagious diseases, such as Ebola, Zika, or swine or avian flu, accidents or the occurrence of an event or condition at our parks, including terrorist acts or threats inside or outside of our parks, negative publicity or significant local competitive events, which could significantly reduce paid attendance and revenue related to that attendance at any of our parks. While we work with local police authorities on security-related precautions to prevent certain types of disturbances, we can make no assurance that these precautions will be able to prevent these types of occurrences. However, we believe that our ownership of many parks in different geographic locations reduces the effects of adverse weather and these other types of occurrences on our consolidated results. If such an adverse event were to occur, we may be unable to borrow under the Amended and Restated Revolving Loan or may be required to repay amounts outstanding under the Amended and Restated Credit Facility and/or may need to seek additional financing. In addition, we expect that we may be required to refinance all or a significant portion of our existing debt on or prior to maturity and potentially seek additional financing. The degree to which we are leveraged could adversely affect our ability to obtain any additional financing. See "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in the   2015   Annual Report. 
  On June 30, 2015, we entered into the Amended and Restated Credit Facility, which is comprised of the $250.0 million Amended and Restated Revolving Loan and the $700.0 million Amended and Restated Term Loan B. In connection with entering into the Amended and Restated Credit Facility, we repaid the outstanding Term Loan B. The remaining proceeds from the Amended and Restated Credit Facility were primarily used for share repurchases. 
  On June 16, 2016, Holdings issued $300.0 million of   4.875%   senior unsecured notes due July 31, 2024. We used $150.0 million of the proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 Notes to reduce our borrowings under the Amended and Restated Term Loan B. We intend to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate and working capital purposes, which we expect to primarily include repurchases of our common stock from time to time, subject to compliance with our financing agreements, and to the extent we do not use such net proceeds for that purpose, we may use such amounts for strategic initiatives that we may undertake from time to time. 
  Also, on June 16, 2016, we entered into an amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Facility that reduced the overall borrowing rate on the Amended and Restated Term Loan B by 25 basis points through a reduction in the applicable margin from 2.75% plus LIBOR to 2.50% plus LIBOR. In addition to the rate reduction, the $150.0 million prepayment made with proceeds from the 2024 Notes eliminated all future quarterly amortization payments on the Amended and Restated Term Loan B until maturity in 2022.

As of   September 30, 2016  , our total indebtedness, net of discount and deferred financing costs, was approximately   $1,652.7 million  . Based on (i) non-revolving credit debt outstanding on that date, (ii) anticipated levels of working capital revolving borrowings during   2017  , (iii) estimated interest rates for floating-rate debt and (iv) the 2021 Notes and the 2024 Notes, we anticipate annual cash interest payments of approximately $70 million and $85 million during   2016   and   2017  , respectively. Under the Amended and Restated Credit Facility, all remaining outstanding principal of the Amended and Restated Term Loan B is due and payable on June 30, 2022. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately   $238.8 million   of unrestricted cash and   $230.3 million   available for borrowing under the Amended and Restated Revolving Loan. Our ability to borrow under the Amended and Restated Revolving Loan is dependent upon compliance with certain conditions, including a maximum senior leverage maintenance covenant, a minimum interest coverage covenant and the absence of any material adverse change in our business or financial condition. If we were to become unable to borrow under the Amended and Restated Revolving Loan, and we failed to meet our projected results from operations significantly, we might be unable to pay in full our off-season obligations. A default under the Amended and Restated Revolving Loan could permit the lenders under the Amended and Restated Credit Facility to accelerate the obligations thereunder. The Amended and Restated Revolving Loan expires on June 30, 2020. The terms and availability of the Amended and Restated Credit Facility and other indebtedness are not affected by changes in the ratings issued by rating agencies in respect of our indebtedness. For a more detailed description of our indebtedness, see Note   4   to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. 
  We currently plan on spending approximately 9% of annual revenues on capital expenditures during the 2016 calendar year plus a portion of an additional $15 million to $18 million for attractions and other improvements for a major expansion of the waterpark located in Oaxtepec, Mexico for which our public bid was accepted by the Mexican Social Security Institute in February 2016. The waterpark is expected to open to the public in early 2017 and the remaining portion of the $15 million to $18 million in planned improvements will be incurred in addition to our 2017 planned capital expenditures. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , net cash provided by operating activities was   $374.8 million  . Net cash used in investing activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $99.6 million  , consisting primarily of   $101.2 million   in capital expenditures, partially offset by   $2.2 million   of proceeds received from the disposal of assets. Net cash used by financing activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $132.8 million  , primarily attributable to the payment of   $161.5 million   in cash dividends and the repurchase of shares of Holdings' common stock totaling   $119.7 million  , partially offset by the proceeds from the 2024 Notes, of which $150 million was used to reduce our borrowings under the Amended and Restated Term Loan B. 
  Since our business is both seasonal in nature and involves significant levels of cash transactions, our net operating cash flows are largely driven by attendance and per capita spending levels because most of our cash-based expenses are relatively fixed and do not vary significantly with either attendance or per capita spending. These cash-based operating expenses include salaries and wages, employee benefits, advertising, third party services, repairs and maintenance, utilities and insurance. 
  Contractual Obligations 
  Since December 31, 2015, there have been no material changes to the contractual obligations of the Company, outside the ordinary course of the Company s business, except with respect to the issuance of the 2024 Notes and the amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Facility as described in Note 4 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report.

    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
     Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation, as of   September 30, 2016  , of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) or 15(d)-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(f) or 15(d)-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
   
  PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 
   
           ITEM 1. 
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
     The nature of the industry in which we operate tends to expose us to claims by guests, generally for injuries. Accordingly, we are party to various legal actions arising in the normal course of business. Historically, the great majority of these claims have been minor. Although we believe that we are adequately insured against guests' claims, if we become subject to damages that cannot by law be insured against, such as punitive damages or certain intentional misconduct by employees, there may be a material adverse effect on our operations. 
  Certain legal proceedings in which we are involved are discussed in Item 3 of the   2015   Annual Report and in Note   6   to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report. Except as set forth below, there were no material developments concerning our legal proceedings during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  On January 6, 2009, a civil action against us was commenced in the State Court of Cobb County, Georgia. The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries, including an alleged brain injury, as a result of an altercation with a group of individuals on property adjacent to SFOG on July 3, 2007. Certain of the individuals were employees of the park, but were off-duty and not acting within the course or scope of their employment with SFOG at the time the altercation occurred. The plaintiff, who had exited the park, claimed that we were negligent in our security of the premises. Four of the individuals who allegedly participated in the altercation were also named as defendants in the litigation. Our motion for summary judgment was denied by the trial court on May 19, 2011. Pursuant to the trial that concluded on November 20, 2013, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $35.0 million. The jury allocated 92% of the verdict against Six Flags and the judgment was entered on February 11, 2014. A notice of appeal was filed on September 19, 2014, which our insurers are pursuing on Six Flags' and the insurers' behalf, and on October 2, 2014, the plaintiff filed a notice of cross appeal. On November 20, 2015, the Georgia Court of Appeals reversed the jury verdict and remanded for a new trial on both liability and damages. On December 16, 2015, the Georgia Court of Appeals denied the parties  various motions for reconsideration. A petition for writ of certiorari in the Georgia Supreme Court was filed on behalf of Six Flags on January 19, 2016. The Six Flags petition asks the Georgia Supreme Court to grant further review and rule that Six Flags is entitled to judgment as a matter of law without the need for a new trial. On January 19, 2016, the plaintiff also filed a petition for writ of certiorari asking the Georgia Supreme Court to review the Court of Appeals  reversal of the jury verdict. On September 6, 2016, the Georgia Supreme Court granted both parties' certiorari petitions. We have paid the full amount of our $2.5 million self-insurance retention to our insurers. 
  On January 7, 2016, a potential class action complaint was filed against Six Flags Entertainment Corporation in the Circuit Court of Lake County, Illinois. On April 22, 2016, Great America, LLC was added as a defendant. The complaint asserts that we violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act in connection with the admission of season pass holders and members through the finger scan program at Six Flags Great America in Gurnee, Illinois, and seeks statutory damages, attorneys fees and an injunction. The program commenced at the park in the 2014 operating season. The complaint does not allege that any information was misused or disseminated. On June 17, 2016, the court denied our motion to dismiss, and allowed the case to proceed, however we intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves against this litigation. Since this

litigation is still in an early stage, the outcome is currently not determinable and a reasonable estimate of loss or range of loss in excess of the immaterial amount that we have recorded for this litigation cannot be made. 
   
           ITEM 1A. 
    RISK FACTORS 
     There have been no material changes to the principal risks that we believe are material to our business, results of operations and financial condition, from the risk factors previously disclosed in the   2015   Annual Report. For a discussion on these risk factors, please see "Item 1A. Risk Factors" contained in the   2015   Annual Report. 
   
           ITEM 2. 
    UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
     On November 20, 2013, Holdings announced that its Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program that permitted Holdings to repurchase up to $500.0 million in shares of Holdings' common stock over a four-year period (the "November 2013 Stock Repurchase Plan"). Holdings utilized the remaining availability under the November 2013 Stock Repurchase Plan in August of 2016. Throughout the program, Holdings repurchased   11,428,000   shares at a cumulative price of approximately   $500.0 million   and an average price per share of   $43.75  . 
  On June 7, 2016, Holdings announced that its Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program that permits Holdings to repurchase an incremental   $500.0 million   in shares of Holdings' common stock (the "June 2016 Stock Repurchase Plan"). As of   October 21, 2016  , Holdings had repurchased   1,202,000   shares at a cumulative price of approximately   $65.7 million   and an average price per share of   $54.68   under the June 2016 Stock Repurchase Plan, leaving approximately   $434.3 million   available for permitted repurchases. 
  The following table sets forth information regarding purchases of Holdings' common stock during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   under the November 2013 and June 2016 Stock Repurchase Plans:

  CERTIFICATION OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, 
  PURSUANT TO SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 
    
  I, John M. Duffey, certify that: 
    
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Six Flags Entertainment Corporation; 
       
           2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this quarterly report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
       
           3.
