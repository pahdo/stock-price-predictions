Except as the context requires otherwise, as used herein,  Registrants  refers to Prosper Marketplace, Inc. ( PMI ), a Delaware corporation, and its wholly owned subsidiary, Prosper Funding LLC ( PFL ), a Delaware limited liability company;  we,   us,   our,   Prosper,  and the  Company  refer to PMI and its wholly owned subsidiaries, PFL, BillGuard, Inc. ( BillGuard ), a Delaware corporation, Prosper Healthcare Lending LLC ( PHL ), a Delaware limited liability company, and Prosper Capital Management LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, on a consolidated basis; and  Prosper Funding  refers to PFL and its wholly owned subsidiary, Prosper Asset Holdings LLC ( PAH ), a Delaware limited liability company, on a consolidated basis. In addition, the unsecured, consumer loans originated through our marketplace are referred to as  Borrower Loans,  and the borrower payment dependent notes issued through our marketplace, whether issued by PMI or PFL, are referred to as  Notes.  Further, investors currently invest in Borrower Loans through two channels: (i) the  Note Channel , which allows investors to purchase Notes from PFL, the payments of which are dependent on the payments made on the corresponding Borrower Loan; and (ii) the  Whole Loan Channel , which allows accredited and institutional investors to purchase Borrower Loans in their entirety directly from PFL. Finally, although historically we have referred to investors as  lender members,  we call them  investors  herein to avoid confusion since WebBank is the lender for Borrower Loans originated through our marketplace. All share and per share numbers presented in this Form 10-Q have been adjusted to reflect a 5-for-1 forward stock split effected by PMI on February 16, 2016.

Forward-Looking Statements 
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 (the  Securities Act ) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ). Forward-looking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts, and can generally be identified by the use of words such as  may,   believe,   expect,   project,   estimate,   intend,   anticipate,   plan,   continue  or similar expressions. In particular, information appearing under  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  includes forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements inherently involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. Where, in any forward-looking statement, PFL or PMI expresses an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is based on the current plans and expectations of their respective managements, expressed in good faith and is believed to have a reasonable basis. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished. 
  The following include some but not all of the factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated: 
             
    the performance of the Notes, which, in addition to being speculative investments, are special, limited obligations that are not guaranteed or insured; 
                
    PFL s ability to make payments on the Notes; 
                
    our ability to attract potential borrowers and investors to our marketplace; 
                
    the reliability of the information about borrowers that is supplied by borrowers including actions by some borrowers to defraud investors; 
                
    our ability to service the Borrower Loans, and our ability or the ability of a third party debt collector to pursue collection against any borrower, including in the event of fraud or identity theft; 
                
    credit risks posed by the credit worthiness of borrowers, including the impact of borrower delinquencies, defaults and prepayments on the returns on the Notes, and the effectiveness of our credit rating systems; 
                
    our limited operational history and lack of significant historical performance data about borrower performance; 
                
    potential efforts by state regulators or litigants to impose liability that could affect PFL s (or any subsequent assignee s) ability to continue to charge to borrowers the interest rates that they agreed to pay at origination of their loans; 
                
    our compliance with applicable local, state and federal law, including the Securities Act, Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Investment Company Act of 1940 and other laws; 
                
    potential efforts by state regulators or litigants to characterize PFL or PMI, rather than WebBank, as the lender of the Borrower Loans originated through our marketplace; 
                
    the application of federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws to borrowers and to PFL and PMI; 
                
    the lack of a public trading market for the Notes and the lack of any trading platform on which investors can resell the Notes; 
                
    the federal income tax treatment of an investment in the Notes and the PMI Management Rights; and 
                
    our ability to prevent security breaches, disruptions in service, and comparable events that could compromise the personal and confidential information held on our data systems, reduce the attractiveness of our marketplace or adversely impact our ability to service Borrower Loans. 
     There may be other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We can give no assurances that any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will occur or, if any of them does, what impact they will have on our results of operations and financial condition. You should carefully read the factors described in the  Risk Factors  section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of certain risks that could, among other things, cause our actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements. 
  All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, other than as required by law.

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (Unaudited) 

1. Basis of Presentation 
  Prosper Marketplace, Inc. ( PMI ) was incorporated in the state of Delaware on March 22, 2005.  Except as the context requires otherwise, as used in these notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements of Prosper Marketplace, Inc.,  Prosper,   we,   us,  and  our  refer to PMI and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis. 
  The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( US GAAP ) and disclosure requirements for interim financial information and the requirements of Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by US GAAP for complete financial statements. The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . The balance sheet at   December 31, 2015   has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date. Management believes these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of a normal recurring nature, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year or any other interim period. 
  The preparation of Prosper s condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in Prosper s financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities. These judgments, estimates and assumptions are inherently subjective in nature and actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. 
  The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PMI and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  On January 23, 2015, PMI acquired all of the outstanding limited liability company units of American HealthCare Lending, LLC ( American HealthCare Lending ), a company that operated a patient financing platform, and merged American HealthCare Lending with and into Prosper Healthcare Lending LLC ( PHL ), a newly established entity surviving the merger. Prosper s condensed consolidated financial statements include PHL s results of operations and financial position from the date of acquisition forward. 
  On October 9, 2015, PMI acquired all of the outstanding stock of BillGuard, Inc. ( BillGuard ), a company incorporated in Delaware in 2010 that developed applications that help consumers manage their identity, finances and credit. PMI merged BillGuard with and into Beach Merger Sub, Inc., a newly established entity wholly owned by PMI, with BillGuard surviving the merger. Prosper s condensed consolidated financial statements include BillGuard s results of operations and financial position from the date of acquisition forward. 
  Reclassifications    
  Due to the early adoption of ASU 2016-09 on January 1, 2016, reclassifications were made to the financing section of the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows to reflect taxes paid for awards vested under equity incentive plans.  Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.    
   
  2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Prosper s significant accounting policies are included in   Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   in Prosper s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . There have been no changes to these accounting policies during the first   nine   months of   2016  . 
  Fair Value Measurements 
  Financial instruments consist principally of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, Available for Sale Investments at Fair Value, Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities, Payable to Investors and Notes. The estimated fair values of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities, and Payable to Investors approximate their carrying values because of their short term nature.  
  
   9 

Restructuring Charges 
  Restructuring charges consist of severance and contract termination related costs. A liability for severance costs is typically recognized when the plan of termination has been communicated to the affected employees and is measured at its fair value at the communication date. Contract termination costs consist primarily of costs that will continue to be incurred under operating leases for their remaining terms without economic benefit to the Company. A liability for contract termination costs is recognized at the date the Company ceases using the rights conveyed by the lease contract and is measured at its fair value, which is determined based on the remaining contractual lease rentals reduced by estimated sublease rentals.  
  Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale and Notes 
  Through the Note Channel, Prosper purchases Borrower Loans from WebBank then issues Notes, and holds the Borrower Loans until maturity. The obligation to repay a series of Notes issued through the Note Channel is dependent upon the repayment of the associated Borrower Loan. Borrower Loans funded and Notes issued through the Note Channel are carried on Prosper s condensed consolidated balance sheets as assets and liabilities, respectively. We choose to measure certain financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis with unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected reported in earnings. Management believes that the fair value option is more meaningful for the readers of the financial statements and it allows both the Borrower Loans and Notes to be valued using the same methodology. The fair value election, with respect to an item, may not be revoked once an election is made. Prosper estimates the fair value of such Borrower Loans and Notes using discounted cash flow methodologies that take into account expected prepayments, losses, recoveries and default rates. The Borrower Loans are not derecognized when a corresponding Note is issued as Prosper maintains the ability to sell the Borrower Loans without the approval of the holders of the corresponding Notes. 
  Loan Trailing Fee 
  On July 1, 2016, Prosper signed a series of agreements with WebBank to include an additional program fee (Loan Trailing Fee). These agreements are effective August 1, 2016.  The Loan Trailing Fee is dependent on the amount and timing of principal and interest payments made by borrowers of the underlying loans, irrespective of whether the loans are sold by Prosper, and gives the issuing bank an ongoing financial interest in the performance of the loans it originates. This fee is paid by Prosper to the issuing bank partner over the term of the respective loans and is a function of the principal and interest payments. In the event that principal and interest payments are not made, Prosper is not required to make this Loan Trailing Fee payment. The obligation to pay the Loan Trailing Fee is recorded at fair value at the time of the origination of the loan with Other Liabilities and recorded as a reduction of Transaction Fees, net.  Any changes in the fair value of this liability are recorded in changes in fair value of Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale and Notes, Net on the statements of operations. The fair value of the Loan Trailing Fee represents the present value of the expected monthly Loan Trailing Fee payments, which considers assumptions of expected prepayment rates and defaults rates.  
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, as part of its ongoing efforts to assist in the convergence of US GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ), the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers  .  The new guidance sets forth a new five-step revenue recognition model which replaces the prior revenue recognition guidance in its entirety and is intended to eliminate numerous industry-specific pieces of revenue recognition guidance that have historically existed in U.S. GAAP. The underlying principle of the new standard is that a business or other organization will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services. The standard also requires more detailed disclosures and provides additional guidance for transactions that were not addressed completely in the prior accounting guidance. The standard will be effective for Prosper in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, which amended the standard to provide a one-year deferral of the effective date, as well as providing the option to early adopt the standard on the original effective date. Accordingly, Prosper may adopt the standard in either Prosper s fiscal year ending December 31, 2017 or 2018. The guidance can be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. In March 2016, April 2016 and May 2016, the FASB further amended the guidance to clarify the implementation on principal versus agent considerations, the identification of performance obligation and the licensing implementation guidance, and to provide narrow-scope improvements and practical expedients.  Prosper has not yet selected a transition method and is evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting standard update on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.   
  In November 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-16,   Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share Is More Akin to Debt or to Equity   to eliminate the use of different methods in practice and thereby reduce existing diversity in the accounting for hybrid financial instruments issued in  
  
   10 

the form of a share. For hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of a share, an entity should determine the nature of the contract by considering the economic characteristics and risks of the entire hybrid financial instrument. The existence or omission of any single term or feature does not necessarily determine the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract. This standard will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Prosper adopted this guidance on January 1, 2016, and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on Prosper s condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05    Customers  Accounting for Fees Paid in Cloud Computing Arrangement   , which became effective for the annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2015. The guidance changes what a customer must consider in determining whether a cloud computing arrangement contains a software license. If the arrangement contains a software license, the customer would account for the fees related to the software license element in accordance with guidance related to internal use software; if the arrangement does not contain a software license, the customer would account for the arrangement as a service contract. Prosper adopted this guidance on January 1, 2016, and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on Prosper s condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,   Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.   The new guidance simplifies the accounting for measurement period adjustments in connection with business     combinations by requiring that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the     measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. This guidance is effective for     financial statements issued for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.  Prosper adopted this guidance on January 1, 2016, and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on Prosper s condensed consolidated financial statements.   
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  , which requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities arising from a lease for both financing and operating leases, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures.  This guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019, and early adoption is permitted. Prosper will be required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning off the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach.  Prosper anticipates that this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  While Prosper is continuing to assess all potential impacts of the standard, Prosper currently believes the most significant impact relates to our accounting for office operating leases. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718).    This guidance makes several modifications to Topic 718 related to the accounting for forfeitures, employer tax withholding on share-based compensation and the financial statement presentation of excess tax benefits or deficiencies. ASU 2016-09 also clarifies the statement of cash flows presentation for certain components of share-based awards. This guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2017, and early adoption is permitted. Prosper has decided to early adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2016, the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on Prosper s condensed consolidated financial statements.   
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,    Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.    The standard provides guidance for eight targeted changes with respect to how cash receipts and cash payments are classified in the statements of cash flows, with the objective of reducing diversity in practice. This guidance will be effective for Prosper in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018, and early adoption is permitted. Prosper is currently evaluating the impacts the adoption of this accounting standard will have on Prosper's cash flows. 

3. Property and Equipment, Net 
  Property and equipment consist of the following (in thousands): 
  
   11 

Depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $2.5 million   and   $1.3 million  , respectively.  Depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $6.9 million   and   $4.4 million  , respectively. Prosper capitalized internal-use software and website development costs in the amount of   $1.3 million   and   $2.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Prosper capitalized internal-use software and website development costs in the amount of   $5.2 million   and   $5.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Prosper recorded internal-use software and website development impairment charges of   $672 thousand   and   $0   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, as a result of its decision to discontinue several software and website development projects. These charges are included in general and administration expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
   
  4. Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale, and Notes Held at Fair Value 
  The aggregate principal balances outstanding and fair values of Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale and Notes as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , are presented in the following table (in thousands): 

At   September 30, 2016  , outstanding Borrower Loans had   original terms to maturity of either 36 or 60 months  ; had monthly payments with fixed interest rates ranging from   5.32%   to   33.04%   and had various maturity dates through   September 2021  . At   December 31, 2015  , outstanding Borrower Loans had   original maturities of either 36 or 60 months  ; had monthly payments with fixed interest rates ranging from   5.32%   to   33.04%   and had various maturity dates through   December 2020  .    
  Approximately   $0.4 million   and   $2.4 million   represents the loss that is attributable to changes in the instrument specific credit risks related to Borrower Loans that were recorded in the change in fair value during the three and   nine   months ending   September 30, 2016  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Borrower Loans that were   90 days   or more delinquent had an aggregate principal amount of   $2.7 million   and a fair value of   $0.8 million  . As of   December 31, 2015  , Borrower Loans that were   90 days   or more delinquent had an aggregate principal amount of   $2.3 million   and a fair value of   $0.9 million  . Prosper places loans on non-accrual status when they are over   120 days   past due. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , Borrower Loans in non-accrual status had a fair value of   $0.2 million   and   $0.1 million  , respectively. 
   
  5. Loan Servicing Assets and Liabilities 
  Prosper accounts for servicing assets and liabilities at their estimated fair values with changes in fair values recorded in servicing fees.  The initial asset or liability is recognized when Prosper sells Borrower Loans to unrelated third-party buyers through the Whole Loan Channel and the servicing rights are retained. The servicing assets and liabilities are measured at fair value throughout the servicing period. The total gains recognized on the sale of such Borrower Loans were   $0.8 million   and   $4.3 million    
  
   12 

for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The total gains recognized on the sale of such Borrower Loans were   $3.9 million   and   $9.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Borrower Loans that were sold but for which Prosper retained servicing rights had a total outstanding principal balance of   $3.7 billion  ,   original terms of either 36 or 60 months   and had monthly payments with fixed interest rates ranging from   5.32%   to   35.52%   and various maturity dates through   September 2021  . At   December 31, 2015  , Borrower Loans that were sold but for which Prosper retained servicing rights had a total outstanding principal balance of   $3.8 billion  , original terms of either   36   or   60   months and had monthly payments with fixed interest rates ranging from   5.32%   to   31.90%   and various maturity dates through   December 2020  . 
  $9.7 million   and   $6.3 million   of contractually specified servicing fees and ancillary fees are included on our condensed consolidated statements of operations in Servicing Fees, Net for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   respectively.   $29.8 million   and   $14.1 million   of contractually specified servicing fees and ancillary fees are included on our condensed statements of operations in Servicing Fees, Net for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   respectively. 
  Fair value 
  Valuation method     Prosper uses a discounted cash flow valuation methodology generally consisting of developing an estimate of future cash flows that are expected to occur over the life of a financial instrument and then discounting those cash flows at a rate of return that results in the fair value amount. 
  Significant unobservable inputs presented in the table within Note 7 below are those that Prosper considers significant to the estimated fair values of the Level 3 servicing assets and liabilities. The following is a description of the significant unobservable inputs provided in the table. 
  Market servicing rate     Prosper estimates adequate market servicing rates that would fairly compensate a substitute servicer should one be required, which includes the profit that would be demanded in the marketplace. This rate is stated as a fixed percentage of outstanding principal balance on a per annum basis. Prosper estimated these market servicing rates based on observable market rates for other loan types in the industry and bids from subservicing providers, adjusted for the unique loan attributes that are present in the specific loans that Prosper sells and services and information from a backup service provider. 
  Discount rate     The discount rate is a rate of return used to discount future expected cash flows to arrive at a present value, which represents the fair value of the loan servicing rights. We used a range of discount rates for the servicing assets and liabilities based on comparable observed valuations of similar assets and publicly available disclosures related to servicing valuations, with comparability adjustments made to account for differences with Prosper s servicing assets. 
  Default Rate     The default rate presented in Note 7 is an annualized, average estimate considering all Borrower Loan categories (i.e. risk ratings and duration), and represents an aggregate of conditional default rate curves for each credit grade or Borrower Loan category. Each point on a particular Borrower Loan category s curve represents the percentage of principal expected to default per period based on the term and age of the underlying Borrower Loans. The assumption regarding defaults directly reduces servicing revenues because the amount of servicing revenues received is based on the amount collected each period. 
  Prepayment Rate     The prepayment rate presented in Note 7 is an annualized, average estimate considering all Borrower Loan categories (i.e. risk ratings and duration), and represents an aggregate of conditional prepayment rate curves for each credit grade or Borrower Loan category. Each point on a particular Borrower Loan category s curve represents the percentage of principal expected to prepay per period based on the term and age of the underlying Borrower Loans.  Prepayments reduce servicing revenues as they shorten the period over which we expect to collect fees on the Borrower Loans, which is used to project future servicing revenues. 
   
  6. Available for Sale Investments, at Fair Value  
  Available for sale investments are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are reported, net of taxes, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) included in stockholders' equity unless management determines that an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired (OTTI).  
  The amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, and fair value of available for sale investments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , are as follows (in thousands):  
  
   13 

A summary of available for sale investments with unrealized losses as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , aggregated by category and period of continuous unrealized loss, is as follows (in thousands): 

There were   no   impairment charges recognized during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
  The maturities of available for sale investments at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , are as follows (in thousands): 
  
   14 

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , Prosper sold   $10.4 million   of investments which resulted in a realized gain of   $7 thousand  . 
   
  7.  Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities    
  Prosper measures the fair value of assets and liabilities in accordance with its fair value hierarchy which prioritizes information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings and provides for enhanced disclosures determined by the level within the hierarchy of information used in the valuation. We apply this framework whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. 
  Assets and liabilities carried at fair value on the balance sheets are classified among three levels based on the observability of the inputs used to determine fair value: 
  Level 1   The valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments. 
  Level 2   The valuation is based on observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation methodologies for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. 
  Level 3   The valuation is based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the instrument. Level 3 valuations are typically performed using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar methodologies, which incorporate management s own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the instrument or valuations that require significant management judgment or estimation. 
  Fair values of assets or liabilities are determined based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of quoted prices and observable inputs and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Various valuation methodologies are utilized, depending on the nature of the financial instrument, including the use of market prices for identical or similar instruments, or discounted cash flow models. When possible, active and observable market data for identical or similar financial instruments are utilized. Alternatively, fair value is determined using assumptions that management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. 
  Financial instruments consist principally of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, Available for Sale Investments, Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities, Payable to Investors and Notes. Servicing Assets and Liabilities are also subject to fair value measurement within the financial statements of Prosper. The estimated fair values of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities, and Payable to Investors approximate their carrying values because of their short term nature.  
  Financial Instruments Recorded at Fair Value 
  The fair value of the Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale and Notes are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies based upon a set of valuation assumptions. The primary cash flow assumptions used to value such Borrower  
  
   15 

Loans, Loans Held for Sale and Notes include default rates derived from historical performance and discount rates applied to each credit grade based on the perceived credit risk of each credit grade. 
  Investments held at fair value consist of available for sale investments.  The available for sale investments consist of corporate debt securities, commercial paper, U.S. treasury securities, agency bonds and short term bond funds.  When available, Prosper uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of securities available for sale. When utilizing market data and bid-ask spreads, Prosper uses the price within the bid-ask spread that best represents fair value. When quoted prices do not exist, Prosper uses prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets. Prosper generally obtains prices from at least two independent pricing sources for assets recorded at fair value. Prosper's primary independent pricing service provides prices based on observable trades and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information, such as yields for similar types of securities (a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads) and weighted-average maturity for the same or similar securities. Prosper compares the prices obtained from its primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable. Prosper does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in a material difference in the recorded amounts.  
  The following tables present the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value (in thousands): 

As Prosper s Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale, Notes and loan servicing rights do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices, Prosper uses significant unobservable inputs to measure the fair value of these assets and liabilities. Financial instruments are categorized in the level 3 valuation hierarchy based on the significance of unobservable factors in the overall fair value measurement. These fair value estimates may also include observable, actively quoted components derived from external sources. As a result, the realized and unrealized gains and losses for assets and liabilities within the level 3 category may include changes in fair value that were attributable to both observable and unobservable inputs. 
  Significant Unobservable Inputs 
  
   16 

The following tables present quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used for Prosper s level 3 fair value measurements at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 
  Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale and Notes:    

Servicing Rights 

At   September 30, 2016  , the discounted cash flow methodology used to estimate the Note fair values used the same projected cash flows as the related Borrower Loans. As demonstrated in the following table, the fair value adjustments for Borrower Loans were largely offset by the fair value adjustments of the Notes due to the borrower payment dependent design of the Notes and because the principal balances of the Borrower Loans approximated the principal balances of the Notes. 
  The following tables present additional information about level 3 Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale and Notes measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands):

Contingent Consideration: 
  On   October 9, 2015  , PMI, purchased   100%   of the outstanding shares of   BillGuard  . The contingent consideration was primarily performance-based and will be determined over a   one  -year period from the date of purchase. Total contingent consideration due in October 2016 is based on revenues generated and other criteria.  We measured the fair value of the contingent consideration using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow approach. Some of the significant inputs used for the valuation are not observable in the market and are thus Level 3 inputs. Contingent consideration is recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheets under "Other Liabilities." Significant increases or decreases in certain underlying assumptions used to value the contingent consideration could significantly increase or decrease the fair value estimates recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , there were fair value changes of   $65 thousand   and   $192 thousand  , respectively, resulting in a fair value of   $5.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   from the opening fair value at January 1, 2016 of   $4.8 million  .  
  Significant Recurring Level 3 Fair Value Asset and Liability Input Sensitivity    
  Key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current fair value to immediate changes in those assumptions at   September 30, 2016   for Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale and Notes funded through the Note Channel are presented in the following table (in thousands, except percentages): 

* Represents weighted average assumptions considering all credit grades. 
  The following table presents the estimated impact on Prosper s estimated fair value of servicing assets and liabilities, calculated using different market servicing rates and different default rates as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands, except percentages). 
  
   19 

These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be evaluated with care. The effect on fair value of a variation in assumptions generally cannot be determined because the relationship of the change in assumptions to the fair value may not be linear. Additionally, the impact of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value is calculated while holding other assumptions constant. In reality, changes in one factor may lead to changes in other factors, which could impact the above hypothetical effects. 
   
  8. Acquisitions    
  On   January 23, 2015  , PMI acquired all of the outstanding limited liability company interests of American HealthCare Lending, and merged   American HealthCare Lending   with and into PHL, with PHL surviving the merger. In January 2015, PMI completed the allocation of the purchase price of the acquisition of American HealthCare Lending to acquired assets and liabilities.    
  On   October 9, 2015  , PMI acquired all of the outstanding shares of   BillGuard, Inc  . PMI merged BillGuard with and into Beach Merger Sub, Inc., a newly established entity wholly owned by PMI, with BillGuard surviving the merger. The allocation of the purchase price is preliminary and subject to further adjustment as information relative to closing date balances and related tax balances are finalized.   
   
  9. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
  Goodwill    
  Prosper s goodwill balance of   $36.4 million   at   September 30, 2016   did not change during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . We did not record any goodwill impairment expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Other Intangible Assets    
  The following table presents the detail of other intangible assets for the period presented (dollars in thousands): 

Prosper s     intangible asset balance was   $10.1 million   and   $13.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  
   20 

The user base and customer relationship intangible assets are being amortized on an accelerated basis over a   three   to   ten   year period. The technology and brand name intangible assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over   three   to   five years   and   one year  , respectively. 
  Amortization expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $1.0 million   and   $0.2 million  , respectively. Amortization expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $3.0 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively. Estimated amortization of purchased intangible assets for future periods is as follows (in thousands): 

10. Other Liabilities 
  Other Liabilities includes the following: 

11. Net Loss Per Share 
  The weighted average shares used in calculating basic and diluted net loss per share excludes certain shares that are disclosed as outstanding shares in the condensed consolidated balance sheets because such shares are restricted as they were associated with options that were early exercised and continue to remain unvested. 
  Basic and diluted net loss per share was calculated as follows:  

The following common stock equivalents were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share for the periods presented because including them would have been anti-dilutive:   
  
   21 

The number of shares issued and outstanding reflect a   5  -for-  1   forward stock split effected by PMI on February 16, 2016. 
   
  12. Convertible Preferred Stock and Stockholders  Deficit 
  Convertible Preferred Stock 
  The number of authorized, issued and outstanding shares, their par value and liquidation preference for each series of convertible preferred stock as of   September 30, 2016   are disclosed in the table below (amounts in thousands except share and per share amounts):  

The number of shares issued and outstanding reflect a   5  -for-1 forward stock split effected by PMI on February 16, 2016. 
  Common Stock 
  PMI, through its amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, is the sole issuer of common stock and related options, RSUs and warrants. On February 16, 2016, PMI amended and restated its certificate of incorporation to, among other things, effect a   5  -for-1 forward stock split. On May 31, 2016, PMI further amended its amended and restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance.  The total number of shares of stock which PMI has the authority to issue is   475,610,528  , consisting of   298,222,103   shares of common stock,   $0.01   par value per share, and   177,388,425   shares of preferred stock,   $0.01   par value per share. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   70,708,055   shares of common stock were issued and   69,772,120   shares of common stock were outstanding. As of   December 31, 2015  ,   70,367,425   shares of common stock were issued and   69,431,490   shares of common stock were outstanding.   Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held.    
  Common Stock Issued upon Exercise of Stock Options 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , PMI issued   386,720   shares of common stock upon the exercise of vested options for cash proceeds of   $0.3 million  . Certain options are eligible for exercise prior to vesting. These unvested options may be exercised for restricted shares of common stock that have the same vesting schedule as the options. Prosper records a liability for the exercise price paid upon the exercise of unvested options, which is reclassified to common stock and additional paid-in capital as the shares vest. Should the holder s employment be terminated, the unvested restricted shares are subject to repurchase by PMI at an amount equal to the exercise price paid for such shares. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   3,209,345   and   9,806,170   shares, respectively, of restricted stock outstanding that remain unvested and subject to Prosper s right of repurchase. 
  
   22 

For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , PMI repurchased   288,520   shares of restricted stock for   $70 thousand   upon termination of employment of various employees. 
  Common Stock Issued upon Exercise of Warrants 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , PMI issued   51,915   shares of common stock upon the exercise of warrants for aggregate proceeds of   $11 thousand  . 
   
  13. Share Based Incentive Plan and Compensation 
  In 2005, PMI s stockholders approved the adoption of the 2005 Stock Plan. On December 1, 2010, PMI s stockholders approved the adoption of the Amended and Restated 2005 Stock Plan (the  2005 Plan ). The 2005 Plan expired during the year ending December 31, 2015 and PMI s stockholders approved the adoption of the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. On February 15, 2016, PMI s stockholders approved the adoption of an Amendment No. 1 to the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, and on May 31, 2016, PMI s stockholders approved the adoption of an Amendment No.   2   to the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (as amended to date, the  2015 Plan ). As of   September 30, 2016   under the 2005 Plan, up to   56,902,925   shares of common stock are reserved and may be issued to employees, directors, and consultants by PMI s board of directors and stockholders to promote the success of Prosper s business. As of   September 30, 2016   under the 2015 Plan, up to   54,336,473   shares of common stock are reserved and may be granted to employees, directors, and consultants by PMI s board of directors and stockholders to promote the success of Prosper s business. Options generally vest   25%     one year   from the vesting commencement date and 1/48t  h   per month thereafter or vest   50%     two years   from the vesting commencement date and 1/48t  h   per month thereafter or vest 1/36t  h   per month from the vesting commencement date.  In no event are options exercisable more than   ten years   after the date of grant. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , there were   20,684,495   shares available for grant under the 2015 Plan and   zero   shares available for grant under the 2005 Plan. 
  The number of options, restricted stock units and amounts per share reflects a   5  -for-1 forward stock split effected by PMI on February 16, 2016. 
  Stock Option Reprice 
  On May 3, 2016, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of PMI approved a stock option repricing program, (the  Reprice ) authorizing PMI s officers to reprice certain outstanding stock options held by employees and directors that have exercise prices above the current fair market value of PMI s common stock.  The repricing was effected on May 16, 2016 for eligible directors and employees located in the United States and on May 19, 2016 for eligible employees located in Israel. Prosper believes the repricing of such stock options will encourage the continued service of valued employees and directors, and motivate such service providers to perform at high levels, both of which are critical to Prosper s continued success. Prosper expects to incur additional stock based compensation charges as a result of this repricing. The financial statement impact of this repricing is   $0.8 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   $2.0 million   in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and   $2.9 million   (net of forfeitures) that will be recognized over the remaining weighted average vesting period of   2.5 years  . 
  Early Exercised Stock Options

The fair value of options granted to employees is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. This valuation model for stock-based compensation expense requires Prosper to make assumptions and judgments about the variables used in the calculation, including the fair value of PMI s common stock, the expected term (the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding), the volatility of PMI s common stock, a risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends. Given the absence of a publicly traded market, Prosper considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of PMI s common stock at each grant date. These factors included, but were not limited to: (i) contemporaneous valuations of common stock performed by unrelated third-party specialists; (ii) the prices for PMI s preferred stock sold to outside investors; (iii) the rights, preferences and privileges of PMI s preferred stock relative to PMI s common stock; (iv) the lack of marketability of PMI s common stock; (v) developments in the business; (vi) secondary transactions of PMI s common and preferred shares and (vii) the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or a merger or acquisition of Prosper, given prevailing market conditions. As PMI s stock is not publically traded volatility for stock options is based on an average of the historical volatilities of the common stock of several entities with characteristics similar to those of Prosper. The expected term assumptions were determined based on the vesting terms, exercise terms and contractual lives of the options using the simplified method. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option. Prosper uses an expected dividend yield of   zero   as it does not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future.   
  
   24 

Prosper also estimates forfeitures of unvested stock options. Expected forfeitures are based on Prosper s historical experience.  To the extent actual forfeitures differ from the estimates, the difference will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised.   No   compensation cost is recorded for options that do not vest. 
  The fair value of PMI s stock option awards granted during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model with the following average assumptions: 

Restricted Stock Unit Activity 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , PMI granted restricted stock units ( RSUs ) to certain employees that are subject to   three  -year vesting terms or   four   year vesting terms and the occurrence of a liquidity event. 
  The aggregate fair value of the RSUs granted was   $10.7 million  . The following table summarizes the activities for PMI s RSUs during the   nine   months ending   September 30, 2016  : 

The following table presents the amount of stock-based compensation related to stock-based awards granted to employees recognized in Prosper s condensed consolidated statements of operations during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands): 

During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , Prosper capitalized   $156 thousand   and   $202 thousand   respectively, of stock-based compensation as internal use software and website development costs. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , Prosper capitalized   $592 thousand   and   $499 thousand   respectively, of stock-based compensation as internal use software and website development costs. As of   September 30, 2016  , the unamortized stock-based compensation expense adjusted for forfeiture estimates related to Prosper s employees  unvested stock-based awards was approximately   $43.8 million  , which will be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of approximately   2.52   years. 

14. Restructuring        
  Summary of Restructuring Plan 
  
   25 

On May 3, 2016, Prosper adopted a strategic restructuring of its business. This restructuring is intended to streamline our operations and support future growth efforts. Under this restructuring, Prosper closed its Salt Lake City, Utah location.  As a result of this restructuring, Prosper terminated   167   employees across all locations.  In connection with the restructuring, Prosper has recognized employee severance and benefits charges of approximately   $396 thousand   in the third quarter which were included in  Restructuring Charges  within the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
  In addition to the employment costs associated with the restructuring, Prosper is also engaged in marketing for sublease, space in our existing office space that is no longer needed due to the reduction in headcount. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016 Prosper executed the termination of   one   lease. The termination penalties associated with this lease was less than the accrued lease exit liability.  Additionally, during negotiations to terminate another lease, Prosper obtained additional information that resulted in Prosper revising its estimate of future sublease income for that lease.  These events resulted in an aggregate reduction of the lease exit liability of    $1.5 million  .  This reduction has been recognized within  Restructuring Charges, Net  within the condensed consolidated statements of operations.  In connection with the lease termination, Prosper also wrote off $  0.4 million   in leasehold improvements and incurred   $0.2 million   of other restructuring charges.      
  The following table summarizes the activities related to Prosper's restructuring plan (in thousands): 

15. Income Taxes 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , Prosper recognized   $74 thousand   and   $35 thousand   of income tax expense, respectively. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , Prosper recognized   $344 thousand   and   $284 thousand   of income tax expense, respectively.  The income tax expense relates to state income tax expense and the amortization of tax deductible goodwill which gives rise to an indefinite-lived deferred tax liability.    No   other income tax expense or benefit was recorded for the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   due to a full valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets. 
  Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize our existing deferred tax assets. On the basis of this evaluation, it is not more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized and therefore a full valuation allowance has been recorded. 
   
  16. Commitments and Contingencies 
  Future Minimum Lease Payments 
  Prosper has entered into various non-cancelable operating leases for certain offices with contractual lease periods expiring between   2022   and   2027  . 
  Future minimum rental payments under these leases as of   September 30, 2016   are as follows (in thousands): 

26 

Rental expense under operating lease arrangements was   $1.6 million   and   $1.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Rental expense under operating lease arrangements was   $5.3 million   and   $2.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Operating Commitments 
  Prosper has entered into an agreement with WebBank, under which all Borrower Loans originated through the marketplace are made by WebBank under its bank charter.  Pursuant to the agreement, the marketing fee that Prosper receives in connection with the origination of each loan is partially reduced by an amount (the  Designated Amount ) calculated as a percentage of the principal amount of such loan based on the aggregate principal amount of loans originated for the applicable month.  To the extent the aggregate Designated Amount for all loans originated during any month is less than   $143,500  , Prosper is required to pay WebBank an amount equal to such deficiency.  Accordingly,   t  he minimum fee for the remaining three months ended   December 31, 2016   is   $0.4 million  . The minimum fee is   $1.7 million  ,   $1.7 million   and   $1.0 million   in each of the years 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. 
   Additionally, under the agreement with WebBank, Prosper is required to maintain a minimum net liquidity of   $15 million   at all times during the term of the agreement.  Net liquidity is defined as the sum of Cash, Cash Equivalents and Available for Sale Investments.  Violation of this covenant can result in termination of the contract with WebBank.  At September 30, 2016 the Company was in compliance with the covenant.     
  Loan Purchase Commitments 
  Prosper has entered into an agreement with WebBank to purchase   $16.5 million   of Borrower Loans that WebBank originated during the last two business days of the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   and the first business day of the quarter ending December 31, 2016. Prosper will purchase these Borrower Loans within the first three business days of the quarter ended December 31, 2016. 
  Repurchase and Indemnification Contingency 
  Under the terms of the loan purchase agreements between Prosper and investors that participate in the Whole Loan Channel, Prosper may, in certain circumstances, become obligated to repurchase a Borrower Loan from an investor. Generally, these circumstances include the occurrence of verifiable identity theft, the failure to properly follow loan listing or bidding protocols, or a violation of the applicable federal, state, or local lending laws. The fair value of the indemnification and repurchase obligation is estimated based on historical experience and the initial fair value is insignificant. Prosper recognizes a liability for the repurchase and indemnification obligation when the Borrower Loans are issued. Indemnified or repurchased Borrower Loans associated with violations of federal, state, or local lending laws or verifiable identity theft are written off at the time of repurchase or at the time an indemnification payment is made. The maximum potential amount of future payments associated under this obligation is the outstanding balances of the Borrower Loans issued through the Whole Loan Channel, which at   September 30, 2016   is   $3,737 million  . Prosper has accrued   $487 thousand   and   $510 thousand   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, in regard to this obligation. 
  Securities Law Compliance 
  From inception through October 16, 2008, Prosper sold approximately   $178.0 million   of Borrower Loans to investors through its old platform structure, whereby Prosper assigned promissory notes directly to investors. Prosper did not register the offer and sale of the promissory notes corresponding to these Borrower Loans under the Securities Act or under the registration or qualification provisions of any state securities laws. Prosper believes that the question of whether or not the operation of the platform during this period constituted an offer or sale of  securities  involved a complicated factual and legal analysis and was uncertain. If the sales of promissory notes offered through the platform during this period were viewed as a securities offering, Prosper would have failed to comply with the registration and qualification requirements of federal and state laws. 
  In 2008, plaintiffs filed a class action lawsuit against Prosper and certain of its executive officers and directors in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, California. The suit was brought on behalf of all promissory note purchasers on the platform from January 1, 2006 through October 14, 2008. The lawsuit alleged that Prosper offered and sold unqualified and unregistered securities in violation of the California and federal securities laws. On July 19, 2013 solely to avoid the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation, and without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, the parties to the class action litigation agreed to enter into a settlement to resolve all claims related thereto (the  Settlement ). In connection with the Settlement, Prosper agreed to pay an aggregate amount of   $10 million   into a settlement fund, split into   four   annual installments of   $2 million   in 2014,   $2 million   in 2015,   $3 million   in 2016 and   $3 million   in 2017. The Settlement received final approval in a final order and judgment entered by the Superior Court on April 16, 2014. Pursuant to the final order and judgment, the claims in the class action were dismissed, and the defendants were released by the plaintiffs from all claims that were or could have been asserted concerning the  
  
   27 

issues alleged in the class action lawsuit. The first   three   annual installments have been made prior to   September 30, 2016   and the reserve for the class action settlement liability is   $3.0 million   in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016  . 
   
  17. Related Parties 
  Since Prosper s inception, it has engaged in various transactions with its directors, executive officers and holders of more than   10%   of its voting securities, and immediate family members and other affiliates of its directors, executive officers and   10%   stockholders. Prosper believes that all of the transactions described below were made on terms no less favorable to Prosper than could have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties. 
  Prosper s executive officers, directors who are not executive officers, and certain affiliates participate in its marketplace by placing bids and purchasing Notes and Borrower Loans. The aggregate amount of the Notes and Borrower Loans purchased and the income earned by parties deemed to be affiliates and related parties of Prosper for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , as well as the Notes and Borrower Loans outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are summarized below (in thousands): 

18. Subsequent Events 
  Prosper and Colchis Capital Management, L.P. ( Colchis ) entered into a Supplementary Agreement, dated June 1, 2013, and Addendum to the Supplementary Agreement, dated November 18, 2013 (together, the  Colchis Agreement ), pursuant to which Prosper agreed to give Colchis certain incentives to encourage Colchis to invest in Borrower Loans and Notes through the platform. On April 21, 2015, Colchis filed a demand for arbitration to resolve interpretative questions relating to the Colchis Agreement, including, for example, whether certain rights given to Colchis extended beyond the term of the Colchis Agreement. On October 17, 2016, the arbitrator issued a final award in favor of Colchis.   
  On November 17, 2016, Prosper and Colchis entered into a Settlement and Release Agreement, pursuant to which Colchis has agreed to terminate the Colchis Agreement and waive all rights conferred under such agreement in exchange for a   $9 million   cash payment by Prosper and an agreement by Prosper to issue a warrant to purchase shares of a new series of preferred stock representing   7%   of Prosper s capitalization on a fully diluted basis as of the date of the issuance of the warrant (the  New Series ) for   $.01   per share (the  Equity Payment ).  Prosper s obligation to make the Equity Payment is subject to Prosper obtaining the requisite stockholder approval.  This will be accounted for as a termination of a contract.

Prosper Funding LLC 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (Unaudited) 
   
  1. Basis of Presentation 
  Prosper Funding LLC ( PFL ) was formed in the state of Delaware on February 17, 2012 as a limited liability company with the sole equity member being Prosper Marketplace, Inc. ( PMI , "Parent").  Except as the context otherwise requires, as used in these Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements of Prosper Funding LLC,  Prosper Funding,   we,   us,  and  our  refers to PFL and its wholly owned subsidiary, Prosper Asset Holdings LLC ( PAH ), a Delaware limited liability company, on a consolidated basis. 
  The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( US GAAP ) and disclosure requirements for interim financial information and the requirements of Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by US GAAP for complete financial statements. The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . The balance sheet at   December 31, 2015   has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date. Management believes these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of a normal recurring nature, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year or any other interim period. 
  Prosper Funding did   no  t have any items of other comprehensive income (loss) during any of the periods presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  The preparation of Prosper Funding's condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities. These judgments, estimates and assumptions are inherently subjective in nature and actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions, and the differences could be material. 

2. Significant Accounting Policies 
  Prosper Funding's significant accounting policies are included in Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Prosper Funding s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . There have been no changes to these accounting policies during the first   nine   months of   2016  . 
  Fair Value Measurements 
  Financial instruments consist principally of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, Short Term Investments, Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities, Payable to Investors and Notes. The estimated fair values of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities, and Payable to Investors approximate their carrying values because of their short term nature.  
  Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale and Notes 
  Through the Note Channel, Prosper Funding purchases Borrower Loans from WebBank then issues Notes, and holds the Borrower Loans until maturity. The obligation to repay a series of Notes funded through the Note Channel is dependent upon the repayment of the associated Borrower Loan. Borrower Loans and Notes funded through the Note Channel are carried on Prosper Funding s consolidated balance sheets as assets and liabilities, respectively. We choose to measure certain financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis with unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected reported in earnings. Management believes that the fair value option is more meaningful for the readers of the financial statements and it allows both the Borrower Loans and Notes to be valued using the same methodology. The fair value election, with respect to an item, may not be revoked once an election is made. Prosper Funding estimates the fair value of such Borrower Loans and Notes using discounted cash flow methodologies that take into account expected prepayments, losses, recoveries and default rates. The Borrower Loans are not derecognized when a corresponding Note is issued as Prosper Funding maintains the ability to sell the Borrower Loans without the approval of the holders of the corresponding Notes.  
  
   32 

Loan Trailing Fee 
  On July 1, 2016, Prosper Funding signed a series of agreements with WebBank to include an additional program fee (Loan Trailing Fee). These agreements are effective August 1, 2016.  The Loan Trailing Fee is dependent on the amount and timing of principal and interest payments made by borrowers of the underlying loans, irrespective of whether the loans are sold by Propser and gives the issuing bank an ongoing financial interest in the performance of the loans it originates. This fee is paid by Prosper Funding to the issuing bank partner over the term of the respective loans and is a function of the principal and interest payments. In the event that principal and interest payments are not made, Prosper Funding is not required to make this Loan Trailing Fee payment. The obligation to pay the Loan Trailing Fee is recorded at fair value at the time of the origination of the loan within Other Liabilities and is recorded as a reduction in related party expenses on the statement of operations.  Any changes in the fair value of this liability are recorded in changes in fair value of Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale and Notes, Net on the statements of operations. The fair value of the Loan Trailing Fee represents the present value of the expected monthly Loan Trailing Fee payments, which considers assumptions of expected prepayment rates and defaults rates.  
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, as part of its ongoing efforts to assist in the convergence of US GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ), the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  The new guidance sets forth a new five-step revenue recognition model which replaces the prior revenue recognition guidance in its entirety and is intended to eliminate numerous industry-specific pieces of revenue recognition guidance that have historically existed in U.S. GAAP. The underlying principle of the new standard is that a business or other organization will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services. The standard also requires more detailed disclosures and provides additional guidance for transactions that were not addressed completely in the prior accounting guidance. The standard will be effective for Prosper Funding in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, which amended the standard to provide a one-year deferral of the effective date, as well as providing the option to early adopt the standard on the original effective date. Accordingly, Prosper Funding may adopt the standard in either Prosper Funding s fiscal year ending December 31, 2017 or 2018. The guidance can be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. In March 2016, April 2016 and May 2016, the FASB further amended the guidance to clarify the implementation on principal versus agent considerations, the identification of performance obligation and the licensing implementation guidance, and to provide narrow-scope improvements and practical expedients.  Prosper Funding has not yet selected a transition method and is evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting standard update on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.   
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05  Customers  Accounting for Fees Paid in Cloud Computing Arrangement , which became effective for the annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2015. The guidance changes what a customer must consider in determining whether a cloud computing arrangement contains a software license. If the arrangement contains a software license, the customer would account for the fees related to the software license element in accordance with guidance related to internal use software; if the arrangement does not contain a software license, the customer would account for the arrangement as a service contract. Prosper Funding adopted this guidance on January 1, 2016, and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on Prosper Funding s condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,    Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.    The standard provides guidance for eight targeted changes with respect to how cash receipts and cash payments are classified in the statements of cash flows, with the objective of reducing diversity in practice. This guidance will be effective for Prosper Funding in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018, and early adoption is permitted. Prosper Funding is currently evaluating the impacts the adoption of this accounting standard will have on the Prosper Funding's cash flows. 
   
  3. Property and Equipment 
  Property and equipment consist of the following (in thousands): 

33 

Depreciation expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $1,076 thousand   and   $587 thousand  , respectively. Depreciation expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $2,940 thousand   and   $2,483 thousand  , respectively. 
   
  4. Borrower Loans, Loans Held For Sale and Notes Held at Fair Value 
  The aggregate principal balances outstanding and fair values of Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale and Notes as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , are presented in the following table (in thousands): 

At   September 30, 2016  , outstanding Borrower Loans had   original terms to maturity of either 36 or 60 months  ; had monthly payments with fixed interest rates ranging from   5.32%   to   33.04%   and had various maturity dates through   September 2021  . At   December 31, 2015  , outstanding Borrower Loans had   original maturities of either 36 or 60 months  ; had monthly payments with fixed interest rates ranging from   5.32%   to   33.04%   and had various maturity dates through   December 2020  . 
  Approximately   $0.4 million   and   $2.4 million   represents the loss that is attributable to changes in the instrument specific credit risks related to Borrower Loans that were recorded in the change in fair value during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Borrower Loans that were   90 days   or more delinquent had an aggregate principal amount of   $2.7 million   and a fair value of   $0.8 million  . As of   December 31, 2015  , Borrower Loans that were   90 days   or more delinquent had an aggregate principal amount of   $2.3 million   and a fair value of   $0.9 million  . Prosper Funding places loans on non-accrual status when they are over   120 days   past due. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , Borrower Loans in non-accrual status had a fair value of   $0.2 million   and   $0.1 million  , respectively. 
   
  5. Loan Servicing Assets and Liabilities 
  Prosper Funding accounts for servicing assets and liabilities at their estimated fair values with changes in fair values recorded in servicing fees. The initial asset or liability is recognized when Prosper Funding sells Borrower Loans to unrelated third-party buyers through the Whole Loan Channel and the servicing rights are retained. The servicing assets and liabilities are measured at fair value throughout the servicing period.  The total gains recognized on the sale of such Borrower Loans were   $0.8 million   and   $4.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The total gain recognized on the sale of such Borrower Loans was   $3.9 million   and   $9.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , Borrower Loans that were sold, but for which Prosper Funding retained servicing rights, had a total outstanding principal balance of   $3.6 billion  ,   original terms of either 36 or 60 months   and had monthly payments with fixed interest rates ranging from   5.32%   to   35.52%   and various maturity dates through   September 2021  . At   December 31, 2015  , Borrower Loans that were sold, but for which Prosper Funding retained servicing rights, had a total outstanding principal balance of   $3.6 billion  , original terms of either   36   or   60   months and had monthly payments with fixed interest rates ranging from   5.32%   to   31.90%   and various maturity dates through   December 2020  . 
  $9.6 million   and   $5.9 million   of contractually specified servicing fees and ancillary fees are included on our condensed consolidated statements of operations in Servicing Fees, Net for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   respectively.    $29.3 million   and   $12.7 million   of contractually specified servicing fees and ancillary fees are included on our condensed consolidated statements of operations in Servicing Fees, Net for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   respectively. 
  Fair value 
  Valuation method     Prosper Funding uses a discounted cash flow valuation methodology generally consisting of developing an estimate of future cash flows that are expected to occur over the life of a financial instrument and then discounting those cash flows at a rate of return that results in the fair value amount. 
  
   34 

Significant unobservable inputs presented in the table within Note 7 below are those that Prosper Funding considers significant to the estimated fair values of the Level 3 servicing assets and liabilities. The following is a description of the significant unobservable inputs provided in the table. 
  Market servicing rate     Prosper Funding estimates adequate market servicing rates that would fairly compensate a substitute servicer should one be required, which includes the profit that would be demanded in the marketplace. This rate is stated as a fixed percentage of outstanding principal balance on a per annum basis. Prosper Funding estimated these market servicing rates based on observable market rates for other loan types in the industry and bids from subservicing providers, adjusted for the unique loan attributes that are present in the specific loans that Prosper Funding sells and services and information from a backup service provider. 
  Discount rate     The discount rate is a rate of return used to discount future expected cash flows to arrive at a present value, which represents the fair value of the loan servicing rights. We used a range of discount rates for the servicing assets and liabilities based on comparable observed valuations of similar assets and publicly available disclosures related to servicing valuations, with comparability adjustments made to account for differences with Prosper Funding s servicing assets. 
  Default Rate     The default rate presented in Note 7 is an annualized, average estimate considering all Borrower Loan categories (i.e. risk ratings and duration), and represents an aggregate of conditional default rate curves for each credit grade or Borrower Loan category. Each point on a particular Borrower Loan category s curve represents the percentage of principal expected to default per period based on the term and age of the underlying Borrower Loans. The assumption regarding defaults directly reduces servicing revenues because the amount of servicing revenues received is based on the amount collected each period. 
  Prepayment Rate     The prepayment rate presented in Note 7 is an annualized, average estimate considering all Borrower Loan categories (i.e. risk ratings and duration), and represents an aggregate of conditional prepayment rate curves for each credit grade or Borrower Loan category. Each point on a particular Borrower Loan category s curve represents the percentage of principal expected to prepay per period based on the term and age of the underlying Borrower Loans.  Prepayments reduce servicing revenues as they shorten the period over which we expect to collect fees on the Borrower Loans, which is used to project future servicing revenues.      

6. Income Taxes 
  Prosper Funding incurred   no   income tax provision for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Prosper Funding is a US disregarded entity and its income and loss is included in the return of its parent, PMI. Since PMI is in a loss position, is not currently subject to income taxes, and has fully reserved its deferred tax asset, the net effective tax rate for Prosper Funding is   0%  . 
   
  7. Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities 
  Prosper Funding measures the fair value of assets and liabilities in accordance with its fair value hierarchy which prioritizes information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings and provides for enhanced disclosures determined by the level within the hierarchy of information used in the valuation. We apply this framework whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. 
  Assets and liabilities carried at fair value on the balance sheets are classified among three levels based on the observability of the inputs used to determine fair value: 
  Level 1   The valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments. 
  Level 2   The valuation is based on observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation methodologies for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. 
  Level 3   The valuation is based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the instrument. Level 3 valuations are typically performed using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar methodologies, which incorporate management s own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the instrument or valuations that require significant management judgment or estimation. 
  Fair values of assets or liabilities are determined based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of quoted prices and observable inputs and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Various valuation methodologies are utilized, depending on the nature of the financial instrument, including the use of market  
  
   35 

prices for identical or similar instruments, or discounted cash flow models. When possible, active and observable market data for identical or similar financial instruments are utilized. Alternatively, fair value is determined using assumptions that management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. 
  Financial instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, Borrower Loans, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and Notes. Servicing assets and liabilities are also subject to fair value measurement within the financial statements of Prosper Funding. The estimated fair values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their carrying values because of their short term nature.  
  Financial Instruments Recorded at Fair Value 
  The fair value of the Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale and Notes are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies based upon a set of valuation assumptions. The primary cash flow assumptions used to value such Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale and Notes include default rates derived from historical performance and discount rates applied to each credit grade based on the perceived credit risk of each credit grade. 
  Investments held at fair value consist of available for sale investments.  The available for sale investments consist of corporate and government bonds.  When available, Prosper Funding uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of securities available for sale. When utilizing market data and bid-ask spreads, Prosper Funding uses the price within the bid-ask spread that best represents fair value. When quoted prices do not exist, Prosper Funding uses prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets. Prosper Funding generally obtains prices from at least two independent pricing sources for assets recorded at fair value. Prosper Funding's primary independent pricing service provides prices based on observable trades and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information, such as yields for similar types of securities (a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads) and weighted-average maturity for the same or similar securities. Prosper Funding compares the prices obtained from its primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable. Prosper Funding does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in a material difference in the recorded amounts. 
  The following tables present the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value (in thousands):  

As Prosper Funding s Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale, Notes and loan servicing rights do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices, Prosper Funding uses significant unobservable inputs to measure the fair value of these assets and liabilities. Financial instruments are categorized in the level 3 valuation hierarchy based on the significance of  
  
   36 

unobservable factors in the overall fair value measurement. These fair value estimates may also include observable, actively quoted components derived from external sources. As a result, the realized and unrealized gains and losses for assets and liabilities within the level 3 category may include changes in fair value that were attributable to both observable and unobservable inputs. 
  Significant Unobservable Inputs 
  The following tables present quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used for Prosper Funding s level 3 fair value measurements at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :  
  Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale and Notes:

Significant Recurring Level 3 Fair Value Asset and Liability Input Sensitivity 
  Key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current fair value to immediate changes in those assumptions at   September 30, 2016   for Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale and Notes funded are presented in the following table (in thousands): 

* Represents weighted average assumptions considering all credit grades. 
  Servicing Asset and Liability Fair Value Input Sensitivity: 
  The following table presents the estimated impact on Prosper Funding s estimated fair value of servicing assets and liabilities, calculated using different market servicing rates and different default rates as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands, except percentages). 
  
   39 

These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be evaluated with care. The effect on fair value of a 10% variation in assumptions generally cannot be determined because the relationship of the change in assumptions to the fair value may not be linear. Additionally, the impact of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value is calculated while holding other assumptions constant. In reality, changes in one factor may lead to changes in other factors, which could impact the above hypothetical effects. 
   
  8. Commitments and Contingencies 
  Operating Commitments 
  Prosper has entered into an agreement with WebBank, under which all Borrower Loans originated through the marketplace are made by WebBank under its bank charter.  Pursuant to the agreement, the marketing fee that Prosper receives in connection with the origination of each loan is partially reduced by an amount (the  Designated Amount ) calculated as a percentage of the principal amount of such loan based on the aggregate principal amount of loans originated for the applicable month.  To the extent the aggregate Designated Amount for all loans originated during any month is less than $143,500, Prosper is required to pay WebBank an amount equal to such deficiency.  Accordingly, the minimum fee for the remaining three months of   2016   is   $0.4 million  .  The minimum fee is   $1.7 million  ,   $1.7 million   and   $1.0 million   for years   2017  ,   2018   and   2019   respectively.    
  Loan Purchase Commitments 
  Under the terms of Prosper Funding s agreement with WebBank, Prosper Funding is committed to purchase   $16.5 million   of Borrower Loans that WebBank originated during the last two business days of the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   and first business day of the quarter ended December 31, 2016.  Prosper Funding will purchase these Borrower Loans within the first three business days of the quarter ended December 31, 2016. 
  Repurchase and Indemnification Contingency 
  Under the terms of the loan purchase agreements between Prosper Funding and investor members that participate in the Whole Loan Channel, Prosper Funding may, in certain circumstances, become obligated to repurchase a Borrower Loan from an investor member. Generally, these circumstances include the occurrence of verifiable identity theft, the failure to properly follow loan listing or bidding protocols, or a violation of the applicable federal, state, or local lending laws. The fair value of the indemnification and repurchase obligation is estimated based on historical experience. Prosper Funding recognizes a liability for the repurchase and indemnification obligation when the Borrower Loans are issued. Indemnified or repurchased Borrower Loans associated with violations of federal, state, or local lending laws or verifiable identity theft are written off at the time of repurchase or at the time an indemnification payment is made. The maximum potential amount of future payments associated under this obligation is the outstanding balances of the Borrower Loans issued through the Whole Loan Channel, which at   September 30, 2016   is   $3,615 million  . Prosper Funding had accrued   $437 thousand   and   $460 thousand   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, in regard to this obligation.

  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION 
   
  PROSPER MARKETPLACE, INC. 
  This management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, or MD A, contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see  Forward-Looking Statements  in Prosper s Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with Prosper s historical condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and the other disclosures contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  The results of operations for the periods reflected herein are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for future periods, and Prosper s actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those included in the  Risk Factors  section and elsewhere in Prosper s Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  Overview 
  Prosper is a pioneer of online marketplace lending that connects borrowers and investors. Our goal is to enable borrowers to access credit at affordable rates and provide investors with attractive risk-adjusted rates of return. 
  We believe our online marketplace model has key advantages relative to traditional bank lending, including (i) an innovative marketplace model that efficiently connects qualified supply and demand of capital, (ii) online operations that substantially reduce the need for physical infrastructure and improve convenience, and (iii) data and technology driven automation that increases efficiency and improves the borrower and investor experience. We do not operate physical branches or incur expenses related to that infrastructure; instead, we use data and technology to drive automation and efficiency in our operation. As part of operating our marketplace, we verify the identity of borrowers and assess borrowers  credit risk profile using a combination of public and proprietary data. Our proprietary technology automates several loan origination and servicing functions, including the borrower application process, data gathering, credit scoring, loan funding, investing and servicing, regulatory compliance and fraud detection. 
  During the year ended   December 31, 2015  , our marketplace facilitated $3.7 billion in Borrower Loan originations, of which $3.5 billion were funded through our Whole Loan Channel, representing 95% of the total Borrower Loans originated through our marketplace during this period. In the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , our marketplace facilitated   $311.8 million   in Borrower Loan originations, of which   $255.2 million   were funded through our Whole Loan Channel, representing   82%   of the total Borrower Loans originated through our marketplace during this period. In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our marketplace facilitated   $1.7 billion   in Borrower Loan originations, of which   $1.6 billion   were funded through our Whole Loan Channel, representing   90%   of the total Borrower Loans originated through our marketplace during this period. From inception through   September 30, 2016  , our marketplace facilitated $  7.9   billion in Borrower Loan originations, of which $  6.7 billion   were funded through our Whole Loan Channel, representing   85%   of the total Borrower Loans originated through our marketplace during this period.   
  As a credit marketplace, we believe our customers are more highly susceptible to uncertainties and negative trends, real or perceived, in the markets driven by, among other factors, general economic conditions in the United States and abroad. These external economic conditions and resulting trends or uncertainties could adversely impact our customers  ability or desire to participate in our marketplace as borrowers or investors, and consequently could negatively affect our business and results of operations. 
  As discussed below, we saw reduced demand from investors who purchase Borrower Loans through the Whole Loan Channel during the second and third quarters of 2016. As a result, we experienced a decline in transaction fee revenue during this period and expect a decrease in transaction fee revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016 from the fourth quarter of 2015.  Transaction fee revenues reached its lowest point for the year in July 2016, with transaction fee revenues increasing month over month in August and September 2016.  Additionally, we expect transaction fee revenues to increase in the fourth quarter of 2016 from the third quarter of 2016.  Finally, as described in note 14 of the financial statements, Prosper began a restructuring of its operations during the second quarter of 2016, which resulted in increased expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from the nine months ended September 30, 2015.      
   
  Results of Operations 
  Overview 
  The following table summarizes Prosper s net loss for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 (in thousands): 
  
   42 

Total net revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   $34.7 million  , a   59%   decrease from the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to decreased Borrower Loan originations, which decreased 71%. See below for an explanation of the decrease in origination volume.  Total expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   $21.1 million  , a   34%   decrease from the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to a reduction in sales and marketing costs of $22.5 million. Net loss for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   increased $  13.6 million  , primarily due to the decrease in our transaction fee revenue resulting from the decline in Borrower Loan originations during the period.   
  The following table summarizes Prosper s net loss for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands): 

Total net revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   $31.2 million  , a   22%   decrease from the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to decreases in transaction fee revenues and gain on sale of borrower loans due to the decrease in origination volume. Total expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $21.9 million  , a   14%   increase from the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to higher compensation costs as Prosper added more staff to support its anticipated business growth, additional facilities related expenses incurred in connection with expansion into Utah, Delaware and Israel, and restructuring costs of $  14.2 million  . Net loss for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased $  53.2 million  , due to lower revenues and the increased expenses.   
  Origination Volume 
  From inception through   September 30, 2016  , a total of   628,678   Borrower Loans, totaling $  7.865   billion, were originated through Prosper s marketplace. 
  During the   third   quarter ended   September 30, 2016  ,   22,963   Borrower Loans totaling   $311.8 million   were originated through Prosper s marketplace, compared to   79,457   Borrower Loans totaling   $1.1 billion   during the   third   quarter ended September 30, 2015. This represented a decrease of   71%   in terms of both loan amounts and the number of loans.  
  The origination decreases experienced during the third quarter ended September 30 2016 are due to the fact that, beginning in the second quarter of the year, a number of our largest investors paused or significantly reduced their purchases of Borrower Loans.  We believe these investors have paused or reduced Borrower Loan purchases because of an increase in their cost of capital; negative actions and publicity at competitors; and our limited use of investor rebates, which have become more prevalent in the industry.  
  Prosper is taking a number of actions to try to increase the amount of capital committed to make purchases through its marketplace, due to reduced investor demand.  These actions include launching a new line of asset management products, improving the retail investor experience, and pursuing strategic transactions with large institutional investors. There is no assurance that these actions will result in significant additional capital available on the marketplace.  
    
  Revenue 
  The following table summarizes Prosper s revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 (in thousands): 
  
   43 

The following table summarizes Prosper s revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 (in thousands): 

Transaction Fees, Net 
  Prosper earns a transaction fee upon the successful origination of all Borrower Loans facilitated through Prosper s marketplace.  Prosper receives payments from WebBank as compensation for the activities Prosper performs on behalf of WebBank. Prosper s fee is determined by the term and credit grade of the Borrower Loans that Prosper facilitates on its marketplace and WebBank originates.  We record the transaction fee revenue net of any fees paid by us to WebBank. 
  Transaction fees decreased primarily due to lower origination volume through Prosper s marketplace during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The average transaction fee (gross of fees retained by WebBank) was 4.80% and 4.57% of the principal amount of originated loans facilitated through Prosper s marketplace for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.  This increase was due to price increases implemented in the second quarter of 2016.   
  Transaction fees decreased primarily due to lower origination volume through Prosper s marketplace during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The average transaction fee (gross of fees retained by WebBank) was 4.54% and 4.54% of the principal amount of originated loans facilitated through Prosper s marketplace for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. 
  Servicing Fees, Net 
  
   44 

Prosper earns a fee from investors who purchase Borrower Loans through the Whole Loan Channel for servicing such loans on their behalf. The servicing fee compensates us for the costs we incur in servicing the Borrower Loan, including managing payments from borrowers and payments to investors and maintaining investors  account portfolios.  Historically, the servicing fee has been generally set at 1% per annum of the outstanding principal balance of the corresponding Borrower Loan prior to applying the current payment.  For loans sold after August 1, 2016, the servicing fee has been set at 1.075% per annum of the outstanding principal balance of the corresponding Borrower Loan prior to applying the current payment. The increase in servicing fees during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was due to the increase in Borrower Loans being serviced as a result of the increase in sales of Borrower Loans through the Whole Loan Channel in the past year. 
  Gain on Sale of Borrower Loans 
  Gain on Sale of Borrower Loans consists of net gains on Borrower Loans sold through the Whole Loan Channel. The decrease was due to a decrease in volume of such sales and $0.6 million and $3.0 million of rebates offered to certain whole loan purchasers during the three and nine months ending   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  No such rebates were offered in the comparative periods of 2015.   
  Other Revenue 
  Other revenues consist primarily of credit referral fees, where partner companies pay us an agreed upon amount for referrals of customers from our website. The decrease in other revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily the result of decreased traffic to existing partners. As described below, Prosper decreased its sales and marketing efforts in the three months ending   September 30, 2016  , which resulted in less traffic to the marketplace and as a result less traffic to our existing partners.  The decrease in other revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was the result of reduced traffic to existing partners and was offset by $1.2 million that was earned in the period in relation to work performed for a BillGuard partner. 
  Interest Income on Borrower Loans and Interest Expense on Notes 
  Prosper recognizes interest income on Borrower Loans funded through the Note Channel using the accrual method based on the stated interest rate to the extent we believe it to be collectable. We record interest expense on the corresponding Notes based on the contractual interest rates. The interest rate charged on the Borrower Loans is generally 1% higher than the corresponding interest rate on the Note to compensate us for servicing the Borrower Loans. 
  Overall, the increase in net interest income for the periods above was primarily driven by the increase in volume of Borrower Loans funded through the Note Channel. 
  Change in Fair Value of Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale and Notes, net 
  The fair value of Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale and Notes are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies based upon a set of valuation assumptions. The main assumptions used to value such Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale and Notes include default rates derived from historical performance, and discount rates. Loans held for sale are primarily comprised of Borrower Loans held for short durations and are valued using the same approach as the Borrower Loans held at fair value. 
  The following table summarizes the fair value adjustments for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively (in thousands): 

Expenses 
  The following table summarizes Prosper s expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 (in thousands): 
  
   45 

The following table summarizes Prosper s expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 (in thousands): 

As of   September 30, 2016  , Prosper had 392 full-time employees compared to 535 full-time employees as of   September 30, 2015  . The following table reflects full-time employees as of   September 30, 2016   and 2015 by department:  

Origination and Servicing 
  Origination and servicing costs consists primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense related to Prosper s credit, collections, customer support and payment processing employees and vendor costs associated with facilitating and servicing Borrower Loans.   The decrease in the three months ending September 30, 2016 was primarily the result of a decrease in compensation costs of $0.6 million and a decrease in outsourced customer support costs of $0.8 million.   The decrease in compensation costs was a result of the reduction in personnel as part of our May 2016 restructuring.  These were offset by increased amortization costs for internal use software of $0.5 million.   
   The increase for the nine months ending September 30, 2016 was primarily due to an increase in personnel related expenses of $3.0 million, as in the first half of the period Prosper expanded its verification and customer support teams to support the larger number of loans that were serviced and to support an anticipated future increase in loan application and processing volumes.  Additionally, Prosper incurred an additional $0.8 million in costs relating to data services for the Prosper Daily application and $0.5 million in increased amortization costs for internal use software.   These increases were offset by a $1.0 million decrease in outsourced customer support costs during the period.      
  Sales and Marketing 
  Sales and Marketing costs consist primarily of affiliate marketing, search engine marketing, online and offline campaigns, email marketing, public relations, and direct mail marketing, as well as the compensation expenses such as wages, benefits and stock based compensation for the employees who support these activities. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the  
  
   46 

decrease in expenses was largely due to decreased variable costs and a decrease in personnel as Prosper slowed its marketing efforts to reduce demand from Borrowers and maintain marketplace equilibrium.  These decreases included a $8.2 million or 57% decrease in direct mailing costs as Prosper reduced the volume of its direct mail campaigns, a $9.5 million or 92% decrease in partnership costs as Prosper significantly reduced partnership activities and negotiated lower rates with existing partners, a $1.4 million or 85% decrease in online marketing costs as Prosper significantly reduced its efforts in this area and a $1.3 million or 41% decrease in compensation costs as Prosper significantly reduced its sales and marketing headcount with its restructuring, this included the closing of its Utah office which contained mainly sales employees. 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the decrease in expenses was largely due to decreased variable costs and a decrease in personnel as Prosper slowed its marketing efforts to reduce demand from Borrowers and maintain marketplace equilibrium.  These decreases included a $0.7 million or 2% decrease in direct mailing costs as Prosper reduced the volume of its direct mail campaigns, a $20.0 million or 73% decrease in partnership costs as Prosper significantly reduced partnership activities and negotiated lower rates with existing partners and a $1.2 million or 32% decrease in online marketing costs as Prosper significantly reduced its efforts in this area.  These reductions in expenses were offset by a $1.3 million or 16% increase in compensation costs resulting from Prosper's increased sales and marketing headcount during the first half of 2016 (the significant reductions in such headcount only occurred with the restructuring in May 2016).   
  Research and Development 
  Research and development costs consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense related to engineering and product development employees and related vendor costs. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation costs due large grants to new employees who were granted options in late 2015 and due to additional expense as a result of the reprice that occurred in May 2016.  The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to an increase in compensation costs as employee levels in research and development were higher in 2016 before the restructuring that occurred in May 2016.  The total increase in costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, is not as large as the total investment in research and development activities as a portion of these costs are capitalized as internal use software projects, which are amortized in origination and servicing.   Prosper capitalized internal-use software and website development costs in the amount of $1.1 million and $2.0 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.  Prosper capitalized internal-use software and website development costs in the amount of $4.6 million and $5.0 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. 
  General and Administrative 
  General and administrative expenses consists primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense related to accounting and finance, legal, human resources and facilities employees, professional fees related to legal and accounting and facilities expense.  The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily the result of an increase in stock based compensation expense of $0.9 million and  depreciation of $1.5 million.  These increases were offset by savings in professional fees of $0.4 million.  The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to an increase in personnel related expenses as Prosper increased its headcount during the second half of 2015 to support anticipated future growth, and an increase in facilities expenses as Prosper obtained additional space to support the increased headcount.  These headcount levels were subsequently reduced as part of the restructuring that occurred in May 2016.  
  Restructuring Charges 
  Restructuring costs consist of personnel and facilities related costs related to the strategic restructuring of the business that Prosper announced on May 3, 2016.  This restructuring includes the termination of employees in our Phoenix, Arizona and San Francisco, California locations; and the closing of our Salt Lake City, Utah location.  Personnel costs include employee severance and benefits for the termination of 167 employees.  Facilities charges include estimated losses on the sublease and lease termination costs for properties in Phoenix, Salt Lake City and San Francisco.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, Prosper recorded a gain on restructuring due to a favorable lease termination that was obtained that reversed a previous reserve and an favorable adjustment to estimated sublease income for another property's reserve.    
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  The following table summarizes Prosper s cash flow activities for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 (in thousands): 
  
   47 

Net cash decreased for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to the $35.7 million loss, net of non-cash items, $6.7 million reduction in Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities, $10.0 million for purchase of Property and Equipment, an additional $6.5 million for investing activity restricted cash which includes $5 million in additional collateral for WebBank and a $3 million scheduled payment to reduce our settlement liability. Net cash used in investing primarily represents acquisitions of Borrower Loans (excluding acquisition of Borrower Loans sold to unrelated third parties, which is included in cash flow from operations along with the corresponding proceeds from sale of Borrower Loans), offset by repayment of Borrower Loans and $30.4 million of available for sale securities that have been converted into cash. Net cash provided by financing activities primarily represents proceeds from the issuance of Notes, partially offset by payments on Notes.   In the   nine   month ended   September 30, 2015   cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of $165 million raised through the issuance of New Series D preferred convertible shares, which was offset by $29.2 million paid to repurchase common stock from certain employees.   
  Prosper also has available for sale securities that are available for its liquidity needs.  The fair value of securities available for sale as of   September 30, 2016   was $42.8 million. As a result the total cash, cash equivalents and available for sale investments available to Prosper at September 30, 2016 for its liquidity needs was $74.6 million.  At   September 30, 2016  , the available for sale securities included corporate debt securities, commercial paper, US treasury securities and agency bonds. All securities were rated investment grade (defined as a rating equivalent to a Moody s rating of  Baa3  or higher, or a Standard   Poor s rating of  BBB-  or higher) and there were no significant unrealized losses. These securities provided $0.1 million of interest income for the third quarter of 2016. These securities continue to be available to meet liquidity needs. 
  On November 17, 2016, Prosper and Colchis entered into a Settlement and Release Agreement, pursuant to which Colchis has agreed to terminate the Colchis Agreement and waive all rights conferred under such agreement in exchange for a $9 million cash payment by Prosper and equity.  Prosper expects to make the $9 million cash payment in the fourth quarter of 2016.   
  Income Taxes 
  Prosper recognizes benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it believes that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. 
  Given Prosper s history of operating losses, it is difficult to accurately forecast when and in what amounts future results will be affected by the realization, if any, of the tax benefits of future deductions for its net operating loss carry-forwards. Based on the weight of available evidence, which includes historical operating performance and the reported cumulative net losses in prior years, Prosper has recorded a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets.  The income tax expense relates to state income tax expense and the amortization of goodwill from the acquisition of PHL for tax purposes which gives rise to an indefinite-lived deferred tax liability. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  As a result of retaining servicing rights on the sale of Borrower Loans, Prosper is a variable interest holder in certain special purposes entities that purchase these Borrower Loans. None of these special purpose entities are consolidated as Prosper is not the primary beneficiary. 
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  Certain of Prosper's accounting policies that involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity are discussed in Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Critical Accounting Estimates in Prosper s Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes to these critical accounting estimates during the first   nine   months of 2016.

PROSPER FUNDING LLC 
  This management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, or MD A, contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see  Forward-Looking Statements  in Prosper Funding s Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with Prosper Funding s historical financial statements and related notes thereto and the other disclosures contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The results of operations for the periods reflected herein are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for future periods, and Prosper Funding s actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those included in the  Risk Factors  section and elsewhere in Prosper Funding s Annual Report on Form 10-K.    
  Prosper Funding was formed in the state of Delaware on February 17, 2012 as a limited liability company with its sole equity member being PMI. Prosper Funding was formed by PMI to hold Borrower Loans originated through the Note Channel and issue related Notes. Although Prosper Funding is consolidated with PMI for accounting and tax purposes, Prosper Funding has been organized and is operated in a manner that is intended to minimize the likelihood that it would be substantively consolidated with PMI in a bankruptcy proceeding. Prosper Funding s intention is to minimize the likelihood that its assets would be subject to claims by PMI s creditors if PMI were to file for bankruptcy, as well as to minimize the likelihood that Prosper Funding will become subject to bankruptcy proceedings directly. Prosper Funding seeks to achieve this by placing certain restrictions on its activities and implementing certain formal procedures designed to expressly reinforce its status as a distinct corporate entity from PMI.  
  PFL formed PAH in November 2013 as a limited liability company with the sole equity member being PFL. PAH was formed to purchase certain Borrower Loans from PFL and, sell them to certain participants in the Whole Loan Channel.   
  As a credit marketplace, we believe our customers are more highly susceptible to uncertainties and negative trends, real or perceived, in the markets driven by, among other factors, general economic conditions in the United States and abroad. These external economic conditions and resulting trends or uncertainties could adversely impact our customers  ability or desire to participate on our marketplace as borrowers or investors, and consequently could negatively affect our business and results of operations. 
  As discussed below, Prosper Funding saw reduced listings on the marketplace as Prosper slowed down marketing efforts to reduce demand from Borrowers and maintain marketplace equilibrium.  As a result, Prosper Funding experienced a decline in administration fee revenue-related party during this period and expects a decrease in administration fee revenue-related party in the fourth quarter of 2016 from the fourth quarter of 2015.     

Results of Operations 
  Overview 
  The following table summarizes Prosper Funding s net income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 (in thousands): 

Total net revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased $12.2 million, a 46% decrease from the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to the reduced number of loan listings on the marketplace during the quarter, which resulted in decreased administration fee revenue. Total expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased $5.3 million, a 28% decrease from the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to lower corporate administration fees during the quarter. 
  The following table summarizes Prosper Funding s net income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 (in thousands): 
  
   49 

Total net revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased $6.8 million, an 11% decrease from the   nine   months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to a decrease in administration fee revenue.  Total expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased $8.3 million, an 18% increase from the   nine   months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to higher corporate administration fees during the period.

Administration Fee Revenue - Related Party 
  Prosper Funding primarily generates revenue through license fees it earns under its Administration Agreement with PMI. The Administration Agreement contains a license granted by Prosper Funding to PMI that entitles PMI to use the marketplace for and in relation to: (i) PMI s performance of its duties and obligations under the Administration Agreement, and (ii) PMI s performance of its duties and obligations to WebBank under the Loan Account Program Agreement. Effective July 1, 2016 the Administration Agreement was amended.  The amendments included amending the License Fee to include a fixed monthly fee alongside a reduce variable fee and the introduction of a Rebates Fee related to rebates given to investors.  The decreases in the administration fee revenue were the result of a reduction in the number of loan listings on the marketplace during 2016.   The decrease in listings was the result of Prosper reducing marketing spending to reduce demand and maintain marketplace equilibrium.   
  Servicing Fee Revenue, Net 
  Prosper Funding earns a fee from investors who purchase Borrower Loans through the Whole Loan Channel for servicing such loans on their behalf. The servicing fee compensates Prosper Funding for the costs it incurs in servicing these Borrower Loans, including managing payments from borrowers, payments to investors and maintaining investors  account portfolios. Historically, the servicing fee has been generally set at 1% per annum of the outstanding principal balance of the corresponding Borrower Loan prior to applying the current payment.  For loans sold after August 1, 2016, the servicing fee has been set at 1.075% per annum of the outstanding principal balance of the corresponding Borrower Loan prior to applying the current payment.  The increase in servicing fees was due to the increase in Borrower Loans being serviced as a result of the increase in loan originations in the past year. 
  Gain on Sale of Borrower Loans 
  Gain on Sale of Borrower Loans consists of net gains on Borrower Loans sold through the Whole Loan Channel. The decrease was due to a decrease in volume of such sales and rebates issued to certain whole loan purchasers in the second and third quarters of 2016, totaling $0.6 million and $3.1 million in the three and nine months ending September 30, 2016, respectively.    
  Other Revenue 
  Other revenue consists primarily of fees earned from assisting whole loan purchasers with securitizations of their holdings. The decrease is due to the fees earned by Prosper Funding from assisting whole loan purchasers with securitizations. Less securitization fees were earned in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   due to a smaller dollar amount of loans being securitized during the period.   
  Interest Income on Borrower Loans and Interest Expense on Notes 
  Prosper Funding recognizes interest income on Borrower Loans funded through the Note Channel using the accrual method based on the stated interest rate to the extent Prosper Funding believes it to be collectable. Prosper Funding records interest expense on the corresponding Notes based on the contractual interest rates. The interest rate charged on a Borrower Loan is generally 1% higher than the interest rate on the corresponding Notes to compensate Prosper Funding for servicing the Borrower Loan. This is recorded in interest income. 
  Overall, the increase in net interest income for the periods above was primarily driven by the increase in volume of Borrower Loans funded through the Note Channel. 
  Change in Fair Value of Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale and Notes, net 
  The fair value of Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale and Notes are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies based upon a set of valuation assumptions. The main assumptions used to value such Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale and Notes include default rates derived from historical performance, and discount rates. Loans Held for Sale are primarily comprised of Borrower Loans held for short durations and are recorded using the same approach as the Borrower Loans held at fair value. 
  The following table summarizes the fair value adjustments for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively (in thousands):

Expenses

The following table summarizes Prosper Funding s expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 (in thousands): 

Administration Fee Expense - Related Party 
  Pursuant to an Administration Agreement between Prosper Funding and PMI, PMI manages the marketplace on behalf of Prosper Funding. Accordingly, each month, Prosper Funding is required to pay PMI a Corporate Administration Fee, a fee for each Borrower Loan originated through the marketplace, a proportion of all servicing fees collected by or on behalf of Prosper Funding, and all nonsufficient funds fees collected by or on behalf of Prosper Funding.  Effective July 1, 2016 the Administration Agreement was amended.  The amendments included amending the Corporate Administration Fee to a fixed amount of $500,000 per month, increasing the Loan Platform Servicing Fee to $150 per Borrower Loan funded and reducing the Loan and Note Servicing Fee to 62.5% of all servicing fee collected by or on behalf of the Company. The decrease in fees for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was due to lower fees paid on the origination of borrower loans due to the decrease in origination volume.  The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 in the administration fee expense was primarily due to a higher corporate administration fee and higher servicing fees which increased fees owed to PMI by Prosper Funding. 
  Servicing 
  Servicing costs consists primarily of vendor costs and depreciation of internal use software costs associated with servicing Borrower Loans. The increase was primarily due to an increase in depreciation costs and fraud losses.     
  General and Administrative 
  
   52 

General and administrative costs consist primarily of bank service charges and professional fees. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to an increase in outsourced collection fees resulting from enhancements Prosper Funding made to its collection process on delinquent loans that it services. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  The following table summarizes Prosper Funding s cash flow activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 (in thousands): 

The net decrease in Cash for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to purchases of property and equipment of $5.4 million. Net cash used in investing primarily represents acquisitions of Borrower Loans (excluding acquisition of Borrower Loans sold to unrelated third parties which is included in cash flow from operations along with the corresponding proceeds from sale of Borrower Loans), offset by repayment of Borrower Loans. Net cash provided by financing activities primarily represents proceeds from the issuance of Notes, partially offset by payments on Notes. 
  Income Taxes 
  Prosper Funding incurred no income tax expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015. Prosper Funding is a US disregarded entity for income tax purposes and the income and loss is included in the return of its parent, PMI. Given PMI s history of operating losses and inability to achieve profitable operations, it is difficult to accurately forecast how Prosper s and Prosper Funding s results will be affected by the realization and use of net operating loss carry forwards. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  As a result of retaining servicing rights on the sale of Borrower Loans, Prosper Funding is a variable interest holder in certain special purposes entities that purchase these Borrower Loans. None of these special interest entities are consolidated as Prosper Funding is not the primary beneficiary. Otherwise as of   September 30, 2016  , Prosper Funding has not engaged in any off-balance sheet financing activities. 
   
  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
  Prosper Marketplace, Inc. 
  Market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings, values or future cash flows that may result from changes in financial market prices and interest rates. 
  Because balances, interest rates and maturities of Borrower Loans are matched and offset by an equal balance of Notes with the exact same interest rates (net our servicing fee) and initial maturities, we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the net fair value of the combined Borrower Loan and Note portfolios as a result of changes in interest rates. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. 
  The fair values of Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale and the related Notes are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies based upon a set of valuation assumptions. The fair value adjustments for Borrower Loans are largely offset by the fair value adjustments of the Notes due to the borrower payment dependent design of the Notes and due to the total principal balances of the Borrower Loans being very close to the total principal balances of the Notes. 
  Prosper had cash and cash equivalents of   $31.9 million   as of September 30, 2016, and $66.3 million as of December 31, 2015.  These amounts were held in various unrestricted deposits with highly rated financial institutions and short-term, highly  
  
   53 

liquid marketable securities consisting primarily of money market funds, commercial paper, U.S. treasury securities and U.S. agency securities. Cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes.  Due to their short-term nature, Prosper believes that it does not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of these liquid investments as a result of changes in interest rates. Decreases in short-term interest rates will not materially reduce interest income on these cash and cash equivalents because of the current low rate environment. Increases in short-term interest rates will moderately increase the interest income earned on these cash balances.   
  Interest Rate Sensitivity 
  Prosper holds available for sale investments.  The fair value of Prosper s available for sale investment portfolio was $42.8 million and $73.2 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  These investments consisted of corporate debt securities, commercial paper, U.S. agency bonds, U.S. Treasury securities and short term bonds. To mitigate the risk of loss, Prosper s investment policy and strategy is focused first on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements, and then maximizing returns. To manage this risk, Prosper limits and monitors maturities, credit ratings, and concentrations within the investment portfolio. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on Prosper s available for sale investments and the market value of those investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $0.3 million in the fair value of Prosper s available for sale investments as of September 30, 2016, and of approximately $0.6 million in the fair value of Prosper s available for sale investments as of December 31, 2015. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an increase of approximately $0.2 million in the fair value of Prosper s available for sale investments as of September 30, 2016, and of approximately $0.6 million in the fair value of Prosper s available for sale investments as of December 31, 2015. Any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only be recorded if Prosper sold the investments prior to maturity and the investments were not considered other-than-temporarily impaired.

 EXHIBIT 10.1

Exhibit 

Borrower Registration Agreement 
    
  This Borrower Registration Agreement (this  Agreement ) is made and entered into between you and Prosper Funding LLC ( Prosper ). 
    
  The Prosper marketplace is an online credit platform (the  Platform ) operated by Prosper.  Among other things, Prosper offers access to unsecured personal loans in the form of the promissory note attached hereto as Exhibit A (the  Promissory Note ). All loans originated through the Platform are made by WebBank, a Utah-chartered industrial bank ( WebBank  or  Bank ). A separate legal entity, Prosper Marketplace, Inc. ( PMI ), provides services to Bank in connection with the origination of such loans. Prosper services all loans made through the Platform, but has engaged certain third parties (including PMI) to act as agents of Prosper in the performance of such servicing. The following Agreement describes those services as well as your rights and obligations should you elect to register as a borrower on the Platform. Except for Section 22, when used in this Agreement  we  or  us  refers to Prosper, Bank and their respective agents and affiliates (including without limitation PMI in its capacity as agent of Prosper or Bank, and Prosper Healthcare Lending). 
    
  1. Registration as a Prosper Borrower.   You are registering with Prosper as a borrower so that you can make loan requests or  listings  through the Platform. In entering into this Agreement, you are agreeing to comply with the Terms of Use for the Platform as well as any other rules or policies set forth on Prosper s website (www.prosper.com), any of which may be amended from time to time by Prosper in its sole discretion (collectively, as amended, the  Prosper Terms and Conditions ). The Prosper Terms and Conditions are accessible via a link marked  Policies  at the bottom of each page of Prosper s website. 
  We reserve the right to restrict access to the Platform to individuals who meet minimum credit guidelines and other criteria, as determined by us in our sole discretion. 
    
  2. Authorization to Obtain Credit Report  . By registering on the Platform as a borrower, you authorize us or our agents (including PMI), to obtain a credit report from   one or more   consumer credit reporting agencies. We may use the credit report for any purpose that would be authorized by applicable law in connection with a credit transaction involving you and involving the extension of credit to you or review or collection of your account, including but not limited to (i) for authentication purposes, to make sure you are who you say you are; (ii) to make credit decisions; (iii) for internal modeling and analysis purposes; (iv) to administer the sale of any Borrower Payment Dependent Notes ( Notes ) associated with your loan or the sale of your loan in its entirety; (v) to determine how much debt you currently have, in order to determine your debt-to-income ratio; (vi) to obtain your credit score and assign you a Prosper Rating based in part on that score; (vii) to obtain and display information and characteristics from your credit report from one or more consumer credit reporting agencies; and (viii) to obtain and display on the Folio Investing Note Trader Platform certain information and characteristics from your credit report from one or more consumer credit reporting agencies at any time or times that a Note corresponding to your loan is offered for sale by investors holding such Notes. Information from your credit report will be displayed on the Prosper website with your listing. You authorize us to verify information in your credit report and your listing, and you agree that Prosper, Bank or PMI (in its capacity as agent of Prosper or Bank) may contact third parties without further notice to you to verify any such information. We may obtain your credit report each time you create a listing and at any other time in our sole discretion, including in connection with loan servicing or collection. 
    
  3. Listings.   The Platform connects applicants who wish to obtain loans with investor members who wish to help fund them. To receive a loan, you, a borrower member, must submit a loan listing through the Platform. The listing is a request by you for a loan in the amount and at the interest rate specified in the listing. In order to submit a listing through the Platform, you must have a good faith intent to obtain and repay your loan, and your listing must be consistent with that intent. 
    
  In order for your listing to become a loan, you must receive aggregate funding commitments from Prosper investor members that equal or exceed the minimum funding amount applicable to your listing. After you submit your listing and complete certain verification stages, Prosper will automatically allocate your listing to one of three funding channels, based upon a random allocation methodology determined by Prosper: (i) the first channel allows investor members to commit to purchase Notes from Prosper, the payments of which are dependent on the payments you make on your loan (the  Note Channel  (ii) the second channel allows investor members to commit to purchase 100% of your loan directly from Prosper ( Active Loan Channel  and (iii) the third channel reserves your loan for sale to an investor member who has already committed to purchase loans like yours from Prosper ( Passive Loan Channel ). Prosper may add or remove funding channels at any time in its sole discretion. 
    
  If your listing receives sufficient commitments to fund, Bank will originate a loan to you in an amount equal to the total amount of those commitments. If your listing is allocated to Passive Loan Channel, it will automatically be considered to have received a commitment equal to the amount of the loan requested. If your listing is allocated to the Note Channel, investor members who  

purchase Notes tied to your loan may resell those Notes to other investor members on our secondary trading platform (the  Note Trader Platform ). Prosper may add or remove secondary trading platforms at any time in its sole discretion. 
    
  Information Included in Listings.   To submit a listing, you must provide the amount of the loan you are requesting as well as your annual income, occupation and employment status. The minimum and maximum loan amounts you may request are posted on the Prosper website and are subject to change by us at any time without notice. We reserve the right to restrict the submission of listings through the Platform to applicants who meet minimum credit guidelines and other criteria, as determined by us in our sole discretion. 
    
  You authorize and agree that we may include in your listing any information from the credit report we obtain pursuant to Section 2 above, including but not limited to the following information: 
    
  (i) Your Prosper Rating, which is calculated by us but based on information from your credit report; 
    
  (ii) Your debt-to-income ratio, expressed as a percentage, reflecting the ratio between the amount of your monthly non-mortgage debt, as compared to the amount of monthly income that you indicated when completing your listing; 
    
  (iii) Whether you own a home; 
    
  (iv) The number of accounts on which you are currently late on a payment; 
    
  (v) The total past-due amount you owe on all delinquent and charged-off accounts; 
    
  (vi) The number of 90+ days past due delinquencies on your credit report;

  In addition, you authorize and agree that we may display any of the above information in a listing for a Note corresponding to your loan on the Note Trader Platform, and that we may display updated information from your credit report, as well as information about the payment history and status of your loan, in any such listing. 
    
  Listings displayed on either Platform may also include any information we ask you to provide, including, without limitation, your self-reported occupation, employment status and range of income. You authorize us to verify your residence, income, employment and any other information you provide in connection with a listing or your registration as a borrower, and you agree that we may contact third parties to verify information you provide. If any such information changes after you submit a listing but before the listing expires, you must either (i) promptly notify us of the change, or (ii) if the listing was allocated to the Note Channel or Active Loan Channel, withdraw your listing. 
    
  In creating your listing, or posting content on your Prosper member web page or anywhere else on Prosper s website, you may not include (i) any personally identifiable information, including, without limitation, your name, address, phone number, email address, Social Security number, driver s license number, bank account number or credit card number, (ii) any information that reveals your race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, sexual orientation, military status, source of income, or plans for having a family, and (iii) any information that is inconsistent with your obligations to refrain from engaging in any Prohibited Activities (as defined below) (any information of the type described in parts (i), (ii) or (iii) being,  Prohibited Information ). We may take remedial action with respect to any Prohibited Information you post on Prosper s web site, including without limitation canceling any listing containing Prohibited Information or deleting or modifying all or any portion of a listing description or other content that contains Prohibited Information; provided, however, that we are under no  

obligation to take any such action, and any posting of Prohibited Information by you on Prosper s web site is done solely at your own risk. 
    
  Listings Allocated to the Note Channel.   Any person who visits the Prosper website will be able to view your listing and see your Prosper Rating as well as certain information about the loan you have requested; provided, however, information from your credit report will only be viewable by investor members. 
    
  We may elect in our sole discretion to give you a partial funding option, which means your loan will be funded if it receives commitments totaling less than the full amount of your requested loan but equal to or exceeding 70% of that amount (subject to the loan size minimum). Each loan listing related to a borrower who was offered the partial funding option will indicate the minimum amount required for the loan to fund. The current percentage threshold for partial funding is 70%, but we may change that threshold from time to time. Any such change will only affect listings created after the change is made. 
    
  Duration of Listings  .   A listing will expire on the earlier of (a) the time at which it has received commitments equal to the full amount of the loan requested (which could be immediately after being listed) or (b) if allocated to the Note Channel, 14 days after being posted, unless the listing is withdrawn by you or cancelled by us prior to either of those events. If a listing is allocated to Active Loan Channel and does not receive commitments sufficient to fund within one (1) hour of being posted, it will automatically be reallocated to the Note Channel. 
    
  WITHDRAWAL OF LISTINGS.   YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO WITHDRAW YOUR LISTING AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE LISTING PERIOD AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. AFTER THE LISTING PERIOD EXPIRES, YOU WILL NO LONGER HAVE THE RIGHT TO WITHDRAW YOUR LISTING. IF A LOAN IS MADE TO YOU, YOU DO NOT HAVE ANY RIGHT TO RESCIND THE LOAN. 
  If you elect to withdraw your listing, you may (but are not required to) submit a new listing. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to limit the number of listings you submit or attempt to submit through the Platform. 
    
  Additional Loans  . The guidelines and eligibility requirements for additional loans are posted on the Prosper website and are subject to change by us in our sole discretion at any time without notice. Subject to these requirements, you may have up to two loans outstanding at any one time, provided that the aggregate outstanding principal balance of your loans does not exceed the maximum loan amount then in effect. You may not submit a listing for a second loan unless you meet the eligibility requirements then in effect as of the date of such submission. 
    
  Prohibited Activities.   You agree that you will not, in connection with any listings, investor commitments, loans or other transactions involving or potentially involving Prosper or Bank, (i) make any false, misleading or deceptive statements or omissions of material fact; (ii) misrepresent your identity, or describe, present or portray yourself as a person other than yourself; (iii) give to or receive from, or offer or agree to give to or receive from, any Prosper investor member or other person any fee, bonus, additional interest, kickback or thing of value of any kind, including in exchange for such person s commitment, recommendation, or offer or agreement to recommend or make a commitment with respect to your listing; and (iv) represent yourself to any person as a director, officer or employee of Prosper, PMI or Bank, unless you are such director, officer or employee. 
    
  4. Right to Verify Information and Cancel Funding. 
    
  a. We reserve the right to verify the accuracy of all information provided by borrower and investor members in connection with listings, investor commitments and loans. We also reserve the right to determine in our sole discretion whether a registered user is using, or has used, the Prosper website illegally or in violation of any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or governmental instrumentality, for purposes of fraud or deception, or otherwise in a manner inconsistent with the Prosper Terms and Conditions or any agreement between Prosper or Bank and such user. We may conduct our review at any time   before, during or after the submission of a listing, or before or after the funding of a loan. You agree to respond promptly to our requests for information in connection with any such review by us. 
    
  b. In the event we determine, prior to funding a loan, that a listing, or an investor commitment for the listing, contains materially inaccurate information (including but not limited to unintended inaccuracies, inaccuracies resulting from errors by us, or inaccuracies resulting from changes in the borrower s income, residence or credit profile between the date a listing is submitted and the date the listing is to be funded) or was submitted illegally, in violation of any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or governmental instrumentality, for purposes of fraud or deception, or otherwise in a manner inconsistent with the Prosper Terms and Conditions or any member agreement, or was generated in error or is otherwise inconsistent with the applicable credit policy and criteria, we may refuse to accept the listing or, if the listing has already been accepted, remove the listing from the Platform and cancel all investor commitments with respect to the listing. 

c. When a listing receives commitments equal to or exceeding the minimum amount required for the loan to fund, we may conduct a  pre-funding  review prior to funding the loan. Loan funding occurs when loan proceeds are disbursed to or at the direction of the borrower. We may, at any time and in our sole discretion, delay funding of a loan (i) in order to enable us to verify the accuracy of information provided by borrower members, investor members in connection with the listing or investor commitments made with respect to the listing; (ii) to determine whether there are any irregularities with respect to the listing or the investor commitments; or (iii) if we become aware of information concerning the borrower member or the listing during our pre-funding review, as a result of which we determine, in our sole discretion, that the likelihood of the borrower not making payments on the loan is materially greater than would be expected based on the assigned Prosper Rating. We may cancel or proceed with funding the loan, depending on the results of our pre-funding review. If funding is cancelled, the listing will be removed from the Platform and all investor commitments against the listing will be cancelled. In the event we cancel funding of a loan, we will notify the borrower, and all investor members who made commitments with respect to the listing of such cancellation. 
    
  d. We may verify any of the information you provide in applying for a loan and creating a listing, and may require that you submit evidence sufficient to permit us to verify the information you provided or other information we deem necessary. We have sole discretion to determine what evidence suffices, and it is your obligation to provide that evidence. If you fail to do so within a reasonable timeframe within our discretion, we may cancel your listing.  However, if we are able to obtain the information we require from other sources, or determine that the information is no longer necessary, your loan may originate even though you have not submitted the required documents. 
    
  5. Matching of Investor Commitments and Listings; Loan Funding. 
    
  a. If your listing is allocated to the Note Channel, Prosper investor members will be able to view your listing and commit funds to purchase Notes issued by Prosper, the payments on which will be dependent on payments Prosper receives from you on your loan. In other words, the Prosper investor members who committed funds will receive payments on their Notes only to the extent you make payments on your loan. If your listing is allocated to the Active Loan Channel or the Passive Loan Channel, Prosper investor members will commit funds to purchase from Prosper a Promissory Note evidencing the loan made by Bank to you. 
    
  b. A match of your listing with one or more investor commitments equal to or exceeding the minimum amount required for the loan to fund, will result in a loan from Bank to you, subject to our right to verify information as described above. The loan will be evidenced by a Promissory Note in the form set forth on the attached Exhibit A. Depending on the loan product you receive, loan proceeds are disbursed into your designated deposit account or they are paid directly to a merchant in satisfaction of your purchase of goods and/or services from that merchant. The loan may be sold by Bank to Prosper, and Prosper may hold the loan or sell it to one of its investor members. Prosper or its agents will service the loan on behalf of the loan s owner. 
    
  c. We do not warrant or guaranty that your listing will be matched with any investor commitments. Your listing must receive one or more investor commitments equal to or exceeding the minimum amount required for the loan to fund in order for a loan to be made. 
    
  d. To safeguard your privacy rights, your name and address will not be included in your listing. Only your Prosper screen name will appear on your listing, and only the screen name of the investor members will appear with investor commitments. 
    
  6. Compensation.   If you receive a loan, you must pay Bank a non-refundable origination fee. The amount of the estimated origination fee is stated in the disclosures provided to you at the time you apply. This amount will decline if you ve been offered a partial funding option and your loan is not 100% funded. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amount of the finally determined fee is refundable. The finally determined fee will be stated in your Truth in Lending disclosure. This fee will be deducted from your loan proceeds, so the loan proceeds delivered to you or at your direction will be less than the full amount of your issued loan. You acknowledge that the origination fee will be considered part of the principal on your loan and is subject to the accrual of interest. 
    
  7. Making Your Loan Payments.   At the time you register as a borrower, you must provide your bank account information to facilitate transfers of funds to and from your bank account. You agree to make your loan payments by automated withdrawals from your designated account, by manual payments you initiate from your designated account, with the first payment being scheduled during the application process, or by check (you must call customer service at 1-866-615-6319 to arrange payment by check). Your loan payments will be made by the payment method you choose. Prosper or its agents will act as the servicer for all loans you obtain through the Platform, and all communications regarding your loan must be made to Prosper or its agents. 

8. Collection   Reporting of Delinquent Loans.   In the event you do not make your loan payments on time, Bank or any subsequent owner of the loan will have all remedies authorized or permitted by the Promissory Note and applicable law. In addition, if you fail to make timely payments on your loan, your loan may be referred to a collection agency for collection. Prosper or its agents may report loan payment delinquencies in excess of thirty (30) days to one or more credit reporting agencies in accordance with applicable law. See the  Permission to Contact  section below for additional important information. 
    
  9. No Guarantee.   Neither Prosper nor Bank warrants or guarantees (1) that your listing will be matched with any investor commitments, or (2) that you will receive a loan as a result of submitting a listing. 
    
  10. Restrictions on Use.   You are not authorized or permitted to use the Prosper website to obtain, or attempt to obtain, a loan for someone other than yourself. You are not authorized or permitted to use the Prosper website to obtain, or attempt to obtain, a loan for the purpose of (i) buying, carrying or trading in securities or for the purpose of buying or carrying any part of an investment contract security, (ii) paying for postsecondary educational expenses (i.e., tuition, fees, required equipment or supplies, or room and board) at a college/university/vocational school, as the term  postsecondary educational expenses  is defined in Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R.   1026.46(b)(3), or (iii) engaging in any illegal activity or gambling, and you warrant, represent and agree that you will not use the proceeds of any loan for such purposes. You must be an owner of the deposit account you designate for electronic transfers of funds, with authority to direct that loan payments be made from the account. Your designated account will be the account from which loan payments will be made. Although you are registering as a borrower member, you may also register and participate on the Platform as an investor member. If you participate on the Platform as an investor member, any amounts in your Prosper funding account are subject to set-off against any delinquent amounts owing on any loans you obtain as a Prosper borrower. You will not receive further notice in advance of our exercising our right to set-off amounts in your Prosper funding account against any delinquent amounts owing on any loans you obtain. If you obtain a loan and fail to pay your loan in full, whether due to default, bankruptcy or other reasons, you will not be eligible to submit any further listings or re-register with Prosper as a borrower or investor member. We may in our sole discretion, with or without cause and with or without notice, restrict your access to the Prosper website or Platform. 
    
  11. Authority.   You warrant and represent that you have the legal competence and capacity to execute and perform this Agreement. 
    
  12. Termination of Registration.   Prosper may, in its sole discretion, with or without cause, terminate this Agreement at any time by giving you notice as provided below. In addition, upon our determination that you committed fraud or made a material misrepresentation in connection with a listing, investor commitment or loan, performed any prohibited activity, or otherwise failed to abide by the terms of this Agreement or the Prosper Terms and Conditions, we may, in our sole discretion, immediately and without notice, take one or more of the following actions: (i) terminate or suspend your right to submit listings or otherwise participate on the Platform; or (ii) terminate this Agreement and your registration with Prosper. Upon termination of this Agreement and your registration with Prosper, any listings you have submitted through the Platform shall be cancelled, and will be removed from the Platform immediately. Any loans you obtain prior to the effective date of termination resulting from listings you had placed on the Platform shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. 
    
  13. Prosper s Right to Modify Terms.   Prosper has the right to change any term or provision of this Agreement or the Prosper Terms and Conditions. Prosper will give you notice of material changes to this Agreement, or the Prosper Terms and Conditions, in the manner set forth in Section 15. You authorize us to correct obvious clerical errors appearing in information you provide to us, without notice to you, although we expressly undertake no obligation to identify or correct such errors. This Agreement, along with the Prosper Terms and Conditions, represents the entire agreement between you and Prosper regarding your participation as a borrower on the Platform, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications, promises and proposals, whether oral, written or electronic, between you and Prosper with respect to your involvement as a borrower on the Platform.

  22. Arbitration. RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES: YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY, AND UNDERSTAND THAT IT LIMITS YOUR RIGHTS IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND US. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REJECT THIS PROVISION, AS PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH (i) BELOW. 
    
  (a) In this Resolution of Disputes provision: 
    
  (i)  You  and  your  mean the individual entering into this Agreement, as well as any person claiming through such individual; 
    
  (ii)  We  and  us  mean Bank and Prosper Funding LLC and each of their respective parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors, and assigns, as well as the officers, directors, and employees of each of them; 
    
  (iii)  Claim  means any dispute, claim, or controversy (whether based on contract, tort, intentional tort, constitution, statute, ordinance, common law, or equity, whether pre-existing, present, or future, and whether seeking monetary, injunctive, declaratory, or any other relief) arising from or relating to this Agreement or the relationship between us and you (including claims arising prior to or after the date of the Agreement, and claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class), and includes claims that are brought as counterclaims, cross claims, third party claims or otherwise, as well as disputes about the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of this Section 22. 
    
  (b) Any Claim shall be resolved, upon the election of either us or you, by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association or JAMS, under the applicable arbitration rules of the administrator in effect at the time a Claim is filed ( Rules ).   Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.   If you file a claim, you may choose the administrator; if we file a claim, we may choose the administrator, but we agree to change to the other permitted administrator at your request (assuming that the other administrator is available). You can obtain the Rules and other information about initiating arbitration by contacting the American Arbitration Association at 1633 Broadway, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10019, (800) 778-7879, www.adr.org; or by contacting JAMS at 1920 Main Street, Suite 300, Irvine, CA 92614, (949) 224-1810, www.jamsadr.com. The address for serving any arbitration demand or claim on us is Prosper Marketplace, Inc., 221 Main Street, Suite 300, San Francisco, CA 94105, Attention: Compliance. 
    
  (c) Claims will be arbitrated by a single, neutral arbitrator, who shall be a retired judge or a lawyer with at least ten years  experience. We agree not to invoke our right to elect arbitration of an individual Claim filed by you in a small claims or similar court (if any), so long as the Claim is pending on an individual basis only in such court. 
    
  (d) We will pay all filing and administration fees charged by the administrator and arbitrator fees up to $1,000, and we will consider your request to pay any additional arbitration costs. If an arbitrator issues an award in our favor, you will not be required to reimburse us for any fees we have previously paid to the administrator or for which we are responsible. If you receive an award from the arbitrator, we will reimburse you for any fees paid by you to the administrator or arbitrator. Each party shall bear its own attorney s, expert s and witness fees, which shall not be considered costs of arbitration; however, if a statute gives you the right to recover these fees, or fees paid to the administrator or arbitrator, then these statutory rights will apply in arbitration. 
    
  (e) Any in-person arbitration hearing will be held in the city with the federal district court closest to your residence, or in such other location as you and we may mutually agree. The arbitrator shall apply applicable substantive law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.   1-16, and, if requested by either party, provide written reasoned findings of fact and conclusions of law. The arbitrator shall have the power to award any relief authorized under applicable law. Any appropriate court may enter judgment upon the arbitrator s award. The arbitrator s decision will be final and binding except that: (1) any party may exercise any appeal right under the FAA; and (2) any party may appeal any award relating to a claim for more than $100,000 to a three-arbitrator panel appointed by the administrator, which will reconsider de novo any aspect of the appealed award. The panel s decision will be final and binding, except for any appeal right under the FAA. Unless applicable law provides otherwise, the appealing party will pay the appeal s cost, regardless of its outcome. However, we will consider any reasonable written request by you for us to bear the cost. 
    
  (f) YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE  

PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person s claims. The arbitrator shall have no power to arbitrate any Claims on a class action basis or Claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other borrowers, or other persons similarly situated. The validity and effect of this paragraph (f) shall be determined exclusively by a court, and not by the administrator or any arbitrator. 
    
  (g) If any portion of this Section 22 is deemed invalid or unenforceable for any reason, it shall not invalidate the remaining portions of this section. However, if paragraph (f) of this Section 22 is deemed invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, then this entire Section 22 shall be deemed invalid and unenforceable. The terms of this Section 22 will prevail if there is any conflict between the Rules and this section. 
    
  (h) YOU AND WE AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, THE PARTIES ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. YOU AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ARBITRATION WILL LIMIT OUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT FULL DISCOVERY, AND THE RIGHT TO APPEAL (EXCEPT AS PERMITTED IN PARAGRAPH (e) OR UNDER THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT). 
    
  (i) You understand that you may reject the provisions of this Section 22, in which case neither us nor you will have the right to elect arbitration. Rejection of this Section 22 will not affect the remaining parts of this Agreement. To reject this Section 22, you must send us written notice of your rejection within 30 days after the date that this Agreement was made. You must include your name, address, and account number. The notice of rejection must be mailed to Prosper Marketplace, Inc., 221 Main Street, Suite 300, San Francisco, CA 94105, Attention: Legal Department. This is the only way that you can reject this Section 22. 
    
  (j) You and we acknowledge and agree that the arbitration agreement set forth in this Section 22 is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section 22. This Section 22 shall survive the termination of this Agreement. 
    
  (k) This section shall not apply to covered borrowers as defined in the Military Lending Act. 
    
  23. Electronic Transactions. This Agreement includes your express consent to electronic transactions and disclosures, which consent is set forth in the section entitled  Consent to Doing Business Electronically  as disclosed in our Terms of Use on our website, the terms and conditions of which are expressly incorporated herein in their entirety. You expressly agree that each of (a) this Agreement and (b) any Promissory Note in the form set forth on the attached Exhibit A that we sign on your behalf, may comprise a  transferable record  for all purposes under the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act and the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act. 
    
  24. Permission to Contact.  When you give us your home and/or mobile phone number, we have your permission to contact you at that number or numbers, and any other number we believe we may reach you through (unless prohibited by applicable law), about your Prosper accounts.  Your consent allows us to use text messaging, artificial or prerecorded voice messages and automatic dialing technology, for all purposes not prohibited by applicable law. Message and data rates may apply. You may contact us anytime to change these preferences. We may also send an email to any address where we reasonably believe we can contact you. Some of the purposes for calls and messages include: suspected fraud or identity theft; obtaining information; transactions on or servicing of your account; and collecting on your account. Our rights under this Section extend to our affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, agents, vendors, and anyone so affiliated with the owner of any note evidencing a loan you obtain. Notify us immediately of any changes to your contact information by changing your contact information on your Prosper account information   settings page. 
    
  25. Appointment of Limited Power of Attorney and Note Registrar. If your listing receives sufficient investor commitments to fund, and you do not withdraw your listing prior to expiration of the listing period, you hereby authorize each of Prosper and PMI (and their affiliates) to act as your true and lawful Attorney-in-Fact and agent, with full power of delegation and substitution, for you in your name, place and stead, in any and all capacities, to complete and execute a Promissory Note containing the material terms set forth on the attached Exhibit A on your behalf in favor of Bank and reflecting the debt obligation reflected on your final Truth in Lending disclosure(s).

  EXHIBIT A 
    
  Promissory Note 
  Loan ID: _________________________ 
  Borrower Address:_________________                   __________________________________. 
    
  1. Promise to Pay.   In return for a loan I have received, I promise to pay WebBank ( you ) the principal sum of ___________________ Dollars ($__________), together with interest thereon commencing on the date of origination at the rate of ____ percent (___%) per annum simple interest. I understand that references in this Promissory Note ( Note ) to you shall also include any person to whom you transfer this Note. 
    
  2. Payments  . I will pay the principal, interest, and any late charges or other fees on this Note when due. This Note is payable in ___ monthly installments of $___________ each, consisting of principal and interest, commencing on the ________ day of _____________, and continuing until the final payment date of __________________, which is the maturity date of this Note. Because of the daily accrual of interest on my loan and the effect of rounding, my final payment may be more or less than my  

regular payment. My final payment shall consist of the then remaining principal, unpaid accrued interest and other charges due under this Note. All payments will be applied first to any unpaid fees incurred as a result of failed payments, as provided in Paragraph 11; then to any charges for making payments other than as provided in this Note; then to any late charges then due; then to any interest then due; and then to principal. No unpaid interest or charges will be added to principal. I further acknowledge that, if I make my payments after the scheduled due date, or incur a charge/fee, this Note will not amortize as originally scheduled, which may result in a substantially higher final payment amount. 
    
  3. Interest.   Interest will be charged on unpaid principal until the full amount of principal has been paid. Interest under this Note will accrue daily, on the basis of a 365-day year. The interest rate I will pay will be the rate I will pay both before and after any default. 
    
  4. Late Charge.   If the full amount of any monthly payment is not made by the end of fifteen (15) calendar days after its due date, I will pay you a late charge of the greater of $15 or 5.00% of the unpaid portion of the monthly payment. I will pay this late charge when it is assessed but only once on each late payment. 
    
  5. Claims and Defenses; Waiver of Defenses; Exception to Waiver.   Except as otherwise provided in this Note, you are not responsible or liable to me for the quality, safety, legality, or any other aspect of any property or services purchased with the proceeds of my loan. If I have a dispute with any person from whom I have purchased such property or services, I agree to settle the dispute directly with that person. 
    
  If and only if the proceeds of my loan will be applied in whole or part to purchase property or services from a person or entity that has entered into a contractual relationship with you or Prosper related to financing of such property or services, the following notice may apply: 
    
  NOTICE 
    
  ANY HOLDER OF THIS CONSUMER CREDIT CONTRACT IS SUBJECT TO ALL CLAIMS AND DEFENSES WHICH THE DEBTOR COULD ASSERT AGAINST THE SELLER OF GOODS OR SERVICES OBTAINED WITH THE PROCEEDS HEREOF. RECOVERY HEREUNDER BY THE DEBTOR SHALL NOT EXCEED AMOUNTS PAID BY THE DEBTOR HEREUNDER  . 
    
  6. Certification.   I certify that the proceeds of my loan will not be applied in whole or in part to postsecondary educational expenses (i.e., tuition, fees, required equipment or supplies, or room and board) at a college/university/vocational school, as the term  postsecondary educational expenses  is defined in Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R.   1026.46(b)(3). 
  7. Method of Payment.   You have given me the choice of making my monthly payments (i) by automated withdrawal from an account that I designate using an automated clearinghouse (ACH) or other electronic fund transfer in the manner described in the debit authorization I execute, or (ii) by manually scheduled one-time withdrawals from an account that I designate using an ACH or other electronic fund transfer, made by logging onto my account on the Prosper website or by calling Prosper Borrower Services at 1-866-615-6319, with my first payment being scheduled during the application process; and I have chosen one of these methods. 
    
  I also understand that I may pay my monthly payments by check. If I have chosen to pay by check by calling Prosper Borrower Services at 1-866-615-6319 and arranging such method of payment, I will make the check payable to Prosper Funding LLC and send the payment check to Prosper Marketplace, Inc., P.O. Box 396081, San Francisco, CA 94139-6081 in a manner so as to ensure that it is received with sufficient time to process prior to my scheduled payment due date.  To ensure efficient processing of my check, I will reference my loan number on the check. 
    
  I recognize that if I have automated withdrawal enabled, it is my responsibility to ensure that all amounts I owe are paid when due, even if not debited from my account. 
    
  If I close my account or if my account changes or is otherwise inaccessible such that you are unable to withdraw my payments from that account or process my check, I will notify you at least three (3) business days prior to any such closure, change or inaccessibility of my account, and authorize you to withdraw my payments, or I will provide a check, from another account that I designate. 
    
  With regard to payments made by automatic withdrawals from my account, I have the right to (i) stop payment of a preauthorized automatic withdrawal, or (ii) revoke my prior authorization for automatic withdrawals with regard to all further payments under this Note, by notifying the financial institution where my account is held, orally or in writing at least three (3)  

business days before the scheduled date of the transfer. I agree to notify you orally or in writing, at least three (3) business days before the scheduled date of the transfer, of the exercise of my right to stop a payment or to revoke my prior authorization for further automatic withdrawals. 
    
  8. Default and Remedies.   If I fail to make any payment when due in the manner required by Paragraph 7, I will be delinquent.  If I (a) am delinquent, (b) file or have instituted against me a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding or make any assignment for the benefit of creditors, or (c) in the event of my death, you may in your sole discretion deem me in default and accelerate the maturity of this Note and declare all principal, interest and other charges due under this Note immediately due and payable. If you deem me in default due to delinquency and if you exercise the remedy of acceleration, you will use reasonable efforts to provide prior notice of acceleration. 
    
  9. Prepayments.   I may prepay this Note in full or in part at any time without penalty. I acknowledge that partial prepayments will not change the due date or amount of my monthly payment. 
    
  10. Waivers.   You may accept late payments or partial payments, even though marked  paid in full,  without losing any rights under this Note, and you may delay enforcing any of your rights under this Note without losing them. You do not have to (a) demand payment of amounts due (known as  presentment ), (b) give notice that amounts due have not been paid (known as  notice of dishonor ), or (c) obtain an official certification of nonpayment (known as  protest ). I hereby waive presentment, notice of dishonor and protest. Even if, at a time when I am in default, you do not require me to pay immediately in full as described above, you will still have the right to do so if I am in default at a later time. Neither your failure to exercise any of your rights, nor your delay in enforcing or exercising any of your rights, will waive those rights. Furthermore, if you waive any right under this Note on one occasion, that waiver will not operate as a waiver as to any other occasion. 
    
  11. Insufficient Funds Charge.   If I attempt to make a payment, whether by automated withdrawal from my designated account or by other means, and the payment cannot be made due to (i) insufficient funds in my account, (ii) the closure, change or inaccessibility of my account without my having notified you as provided in Paragraph 7, or (iii) for any other reason (other than an error by you), I will pay you an additional fee of $15 for each returned or failed automated withdrawal or other item, unless prohibited by applicable law. I will pay this fee when it is assessed. 
    
  12. Attorneys  Fees.   To the extent permitted by law, I am liable to you for your legal costs if you refer collection of my loan to a lawyer who is not your salaried employee. These costs may include reasonable attorneys  fees as well as costs and expenses of any legal action. 
    
  13. Loan Charges.   If a law that applies to my loan and sets maximum loan charges is finally interpreted so that the interest or other loan charges collected or to be collected in connection with my loan exceed the permitted limits, then: (a) any such loan charge shall be reduced by the amount necessary to reduce the charge to the permitted limit; and (b) any sums already collected from me that exceeded permitted limits will be refunded to me. You may choose to make this refund by reducing the principal I owe under this Note or by making a direct payment to me. 
    
  14. Assignment.   I may not assign any of my obligations under this Note without your written permission. You may assign this Note at any time without my permission. Unless prohibited by applicable law, you may do so without telling me. My obligations under this Note apply to all of my heirs and permitted assigns. Your rights under this Note apply to each of your successors and assigns. 
    
  15. Notices.   All notices and other communications hereunder shall be given in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given and effective (i) upon receipt, if delivered in person or by facsimile, email or other electronic transmission, or (ii) one day after deposit prepaid for overnight delivery with a national overnight express delivery service.

  16. Governing Law.   This Note is governed by federal law and, to the extent that state law applies, the laws of the State of Utah. 
    
  17. Miscellaneous.   No provision of this Note shall be modified or limited except by a written agreement signed by both you and me. The unenforceability of any provision of this Note shall not affect the enforceability or validity of any other provision of this Note. 

18. Arbitration. RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES: I HAVE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY, AND UNDERSTAND THAT IT LIMITS MY RIGHTS IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND ME. I UNDERSTAND THAT I HAVE THE RIGHT TO REJECT THIS PROVISION, AS PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH (i) BELOW. 
    
  (a) In this Resolution of Disputes provision: 
    
  (i)  I,   me  and  my  mean the promisor under this Note, as well as any person claiming through such promisor; 
    
  (ii)  You  and  your  mean WebBank, any person servicing this Note for WebBank, any subsequent holders of this Note or any interest in this Note, any person servicing this Note for such subsequent holder of this note, and each of their respective parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors, and assigns, as well as the officers, directors, and employees of each of them; and 
    
  (iii)  Claim  means any dispute, claim, or controversy (whether based on contract, tort, intentional tort, constitution, statute, ordinance, common law, or equity, whether pre-existing, present, or future, and whether seeking monetary, injunctive, declaratory, or any other relief) arising from or relating to this Note or the relationship between you and me (including claims arising prior to or after the date of the Note, and claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which I am not a member of a certified class), and includes claims that are brought as counterclaims, cross claims, third party claims or otherwise, as well as disputes about the validity or enforceability of this Note or the validity or enforceability of this Section. 
    
  (b) Any Claim shall be resolved, upon the election of either you or me, by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association or JAMS, under the applicable arbitration rules of the administrator in effect at the time a Claim is filed ( Rules ).   Any arbitration under this arbitration agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.   If I file a claim, I may choose the administrator; if you file a claim, you may choose the administrator, but you agree to change to the other permitted administrator at my request (assuming that the other administrator is available). I can obtain the Rules and other information about initiating arbitration by contacting the American Arbitration Association at 1633 Broadway, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10019, (800) 778-7879, www.adr.org; or by contacting JAMS at 1920 Main Street, Suite 300, Irvine, CA 92614, (949) 224-1810, www.jamsadr.com. Your address for serving any arbitration demand or claim is WebBank, c/o Prosper Marketplace, Inc., 221 Main Street, Third Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105, Attention: Legal Department. 
    
  (c) Claims will be arbitrated by a single, neutral arbitrator, who shall be a retired judge or a lawyer with at least ten years  experience. You agree not to invoke your right to elect arbitration of an individual Claim filed by me in a small claims or similar court (if any), so long as the Claim is pending on an individual basis only in such court. 
    
  (d) You will pay all filing and administration fees charged by the administrator and arbitrator fees up to $1,000, and you will consider my request to pay any additional arbitration costs. If an arbitrator issues an award in your favor, I will not be required to reimburse you for any fees you have previously paid to the administrator or for which you are responsible. If I receive an award from the arbitrator, you will reimburse me for any fees paid by me to the administrator or arbitrator. Each party shall bear its own attorney s, expert s and witness fees, which shall not be considered costs of arbitration; however, if a statute gives me the right to recover these fees, or fees paid to the administrator or arbitrator, then these statutory rights will apply in arbitration. 
    
  (e) Any in-person arbitration hearing will be held in the city with the federal district court closest to my residence, or in such other location as you and we may mutually agree. The arbitrator shall apply applicable substantive law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.   1-16, and, if requested by either party, provide written reasoned findings of fact and conclusions of law. The arbitrator shall have the power to award any relief authorized under applicable law. Any appropriate court may enter judgment upon the arbitrator s award. The arbitrator s decision will be final and binding except that: (1) any party may exercise any appeal right under the FAA; and (2) any party may appeal any award relating to a claim for more than $100,000 to a three-arbitrator panel appointed by the administrator, which will reconsider de novo any aspect of the appealed award. The panel s decision will be final and binding, except for any appeal right under the FAA. Unless applicable law provides otherwise, the appealing party will pay the appeal s cost, regardless of its outcome. However, you will consider any reasonable written request by me for you to bear the cost. 
    
  (f) YOU AND I AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and I agree otherwise in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one  

person s claims. The arbitrator shall have no power to arbitrate any Claims on a class action basis or Claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other borrowers, or other persons similarly situated. The validity and effect of this paragraph (f) shall be determined exclusively by a court, and not by the administrator or any arbitrator. 
  (g) If any portion of this Section 18 is deemed invalid or unenforceable for any reason, it shall not invalidate the remaining portions of this section. However, if paragraph (f) of this Section 18 is deemed invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, then this entire Section 18 shall be deemed invalid and unenforceable. The terms of this Section 18 will prevail if there is any conflict between the Rules and this section. 
  (h) YOU AND I AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS NOTE, THE PARTIES ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. YOU AND I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ARBITRATION WILL LIMIT OUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT FULL DISCOVERY, AND THE RIGHT TO APPEAL (EXCEPT AS PERMITTED IN PARAGRAPH (e) OR UNDER THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT). 
    
  (i) I understand that I may reject the provisions of this Section 18, in which case neither you nor I will have the right to elect arbitration. Rejection of this Section 18 will not affect the remaining parts of this Note. To reject this Section 18, I must send you written notice of my rejection within 30 days after the date that this Note was made. I must include my name, address, and account number. The notice of rejection must be mailed to WebBank, c/o Prosper Marketplace, Inc., 221 Main Street, San Francisco, CA 94105, Attention: Legal Department. This is the only way that I can reject this Section 18. 
    
  (j) You and I acknowledge and agree that the arbitration agreement set forth in this Section 18 is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section 18. This Section 18 shall survive the termination of this Note and the repayment of any or all amounts borrowed thereunder. 
  (k) This section shall not apply to covered borrowers as defined in the Military Lending Act. 
    
  19. Electronic Transactions.    THIS NOTE INCLUDES YOUR EXPRESS CONSENT TO ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS AND DISCLOSURES, WHICH CONSENT IS SET FORTH IN THE PARAGRAPH ENTITLED  CONSENT TO DOING BUSINESS ELECTRONICALLY  AS DISCLOSED IN PROSPER S TERMS OF USE ON PROSPER.COM, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF WHICH ARE EXPRESSLY INCORPORATED HEREIN IN THEIR ENTIRETY.  YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT THIS NOTE MAY COMPRISE A  TRANSFERABLE RECORD  FOR ALL PURPOSES UNDER THE ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES IN GLOBAL AND NATIONAL COMMERCE ACT AND THE UNIFORM ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS ACT. 
    
  20. Registration of Note Owners.  I have appointed Prosper Funding LLC as my authorized agent (in such capacity, the  Note Registrar ) to maintain a book-entry system (the  Register ) for recording the beneficial owners of interests in this Note (the  Note Owners ).  The person or persons identified as the Note Owners in the Register shall be deemed to be the owner(s) of this Note for purposes of receiving payment of principal and interest on such Note and for all other purposes. With respect to any transfer by a Note Owner of its beneficial interest in this Note, the right to payment of principal and interest on this Note shall not be effective until the transfer is recorded in the Register.
