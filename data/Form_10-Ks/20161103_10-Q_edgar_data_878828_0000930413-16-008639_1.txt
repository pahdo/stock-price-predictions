NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
AND POLICIES  

The condensed consolidated balance
sheet as of September 30, 2016, the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine-month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, and the condensed consolidated statement of shareholders  equity for the nine-month period ended September
30, 2016 have been prepared by the Company (as defined below) without audit. The condensed consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of Wireless Telecom Group, Inc., which operates one of its product lines under the trade name Noisecom, Inc. ( Noisecom ),
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Boonton Electronics Corporation ( Boonton ), Microlab/FXR ( Microlab ),
WTG Foreign Sales Corporation and NC Mahwah, Inc., which are collectively referred to herein as, the  Company . All
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.   

In the opinion of management, the accompanying
condensed consolidated financial statements referred to above contain all necessary adjustments, consisting of normal accruals
and recurring entries, which are necessary to fairly present the Company s results for the interim periods being presented. 

The accounting policies followed by
the Company are set forth in Note 1 to the Company s financial statements included in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015. Specific reference is made to that report since certain information and footnote disclosures normally
included in financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US
GAAP) have been condensed or omitted from this report. 

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities (including inventory valuation, accounts receivable valuation, valuation of deferred tax assets, estimated fair values
of stock options and vesting periods of performance-based stock options and restricted stock) and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

The results of operations for the three
and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year
ending December 31, 2016. 

Financial instruments that potentially
subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. 

The Company maintains significant cash
investments primarily with two financial institutions, which at times may exceed federally insured limits. The Company performs
periodic evaluations of the relative credit rating of these institutions as part of its investment strategy. 

The Company has limited concentration
of credit risk in accounts receivable due to the large number of entities comprising our customer base and their dispersion across
many different industries and geographies. Credit evaluations are performed on customers requiring credit over a certain amount.
Credit risk is mitigated to a lesser extent through collateral such as letters of credit, bank guarantees or payment terms like
cash in advance. Credit evaluation is performed independent of the Company s sales team to ensure segregation of duties. 

For the three and nine-months ended
September 30, 2016, one customer accounted for approximately 11% and 10%, respectively, of the Company s consolidated revenues.
For the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2015, no customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company s consolidated
revenues. At September 30, 2016, one customer represented approximately 15% of the Company s gross accounts receivable. At
December 31, 2015, no customer represented 10% or more of the Company s gross accounts receivable. 

The carrying amounts of cash and cash
equivalents, trade receivables, other current assets and liabilities approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these
instruments.

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
AND POLICIES (Continued)  

The Company considers all highly liquid
investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist
of bank and money market accounts. 

Management has evaluated subsequent
events and determined that there were no subsequent events or transactions requiring recognition or disclosure in the condensed
consolidated financial statements through the date the financial statements were issued. 

NOTE 2   RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   

In August 2016, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15,   Classification of
Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,   to address some questions about the presentation and classification of certain
cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. The update addresses eight specific issues, including contingent
consideration payments made after a business combination, distribution received from equity method investees and the classification
of cash receipts and payments that have aspects of more than one class of cash flows. This standard will be effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.
The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-15 on its consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU
2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation:  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  
which relates to the accounting for employee share-based payments. This standard addresses several aspects of the accounting
for share-based payment award transactions, including:  (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either
equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. This standard will be effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is in the process of evaluating
the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on its consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU
2016-02   Leases ,  which creates new accounting and reporting guidelines for leasing arrangements. The new standard
will require organizations that lease assets to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet related to the rights and
obligations created by those leases, regardless of whether they are classified as finance or operating leases. Consistent with
current guidance, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease primarily will
depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. The standard will also require new disclosure to help financial statement
users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The new standard will be effective
for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, with early
application permitted. The new standard is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is in the process
of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,
  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.   ASU 2015-11 applies to inventory that is measured using first-in,
first-out (FIFO) or average cost.  An entity should measure inventory within the scope of ASU 2015-11 at the lower of cost
and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably
predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The amendments in ASU 2015-11 more closely align the measurement
of inventory in US GAAP with the measurement of inventory in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). ASU
2015-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is in the process of evaluating
the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 2   RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS (Continued)  

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model
requiring a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount reflecting the
consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date ,  which defers the effective date by one year,
with early adoption on the original effective date permitted. As a result, ASU 2014-09 will be effective for annual and interim
periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on the
Company s consolidated financial statements. 

Management does not believe that any
other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material impact on the accompanying
condensed consolidated financial statements. 

NOTE 3   INCOME TAXES  

The Company records deferred taxes
in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 740,   Accounting for Income Taxes . 
ASC 740 requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between tax basis of assets and liabilities
and the amounts at which they are carried in the financial statements, based upon the enacted rates in effect for the year in which
the differences are expected to reverse. The Company establishes a valuation allowance when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets
to the amount expected to be realized. The Company periodically assesses the value of its deferred tax assets and determines the
necessity for a valuation allowance. 

The Company had a domestic net
operating loss carryforward at September 30, 2016 of approximately $17,800,000 which expires in 2029. The Company also had a
German net operating loss carryforward at September 30, 2016 of approximately 12,900,000 Euro s and approximately
12,400,000 Euro s for German Corporate tax and German Trade tax purposes, respectively. 

Realization of
the Company s deferred tax assets is dependent upon the Company generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate
tax jurisdictions in future years to obtain benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences and
from utilization of net operating losses. The Company s valuation allowances of $4,331,265 and $4,188,688 at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, are associated with the Company s German net operating loss carryforward
from an inactive German entity. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future
periods if estimates of future taxable income are changed. As of September 30, 2016, management believed that it was more
likely than not that the Company will fully realize the benefits of its deferred tax asset associated with its domestic net
operating loss carryforward. 

The deferred income tax assets (liabilities)
are summarized as follows: 

Under ASC 740, the Company must recognize
the tax benefit from an uncertain position only if it is more-likely-than-not the tax position will be sustained on examination
by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements
attributable to such position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized
upon the ultimate resolution of the position.

NOTE 3   INCOME TAXES (Continued)  

The components of the provision for
income taxes (benefit) are as follows: 

The Company has analyzed its filing
positions in all of the Federal and state jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns. As of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, the Company identified its Federal tax return and its state tax return in New Jersey as  major 
tax jurisdictions, as defined, in which it is required to file income tax returns. Based on the evaluations noted above, the Company
concluded that there were no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition or disclosure in its condensed consolidated
financial statements. 

NOTE 4 - INCOME (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE  

Basic earnings (loss) per share is
calculated by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted income (loss) per share is calculated by using the weighted average number of shares of
common stock outstanding and, when dilutive, potential shares from stock options and warrants to purchase common stock, using the
treasury stock method. 

Common stock options are included in
the diluted income (loss) per share calculation when the various option exercise prices are less than their relative average market
price during the periods presented in this quarterly report. The weighted average number of shares of common stock underlying options
not included in diluted income (loss) per share, because the effects are anti-dilutive, was 2,781,844 and 2,061,830 for the three-months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the weighted average number
of shares of common stock underlying options not included in diluted income (loss) per share was 2,992,083 and 1,691,515, respectively.

NOTE 5   INVENTORIES 

Inventory carrying value is net of
inventory reserves of $1,331,657 and $1,110,288 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

NOTE 6 - GOODWILL 

Goodwill represents the excess of the
aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a purchase business combination. Goodwill is not amortized
but rather is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if a triggering event occurs. Management first makes
a qualitative assessment of whether it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying
amount before applying the two-step goodwill impairment test described below. If, based on the qualitative assessment, the estimated
fair value is well in excess of its carrying amount, management will not perform a quantitative assessment. If, however, the conclusion
is that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, management then performs
a two-step goodwill impairment test. Under the first step, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value,
and, if an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit, the Company must perform step two of the impairment
test (measurement). 

Under step two, an impairment loss
is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill as determined by allocating the fair
value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. The residual fair value after this allocation is
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill. 

The Company s goodwill balance
of $1,351,392 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 related to one of the Company s reporting units, Microlab. Management s
qualitative assessment performed in the fourth quarter of 2015 did not indicate any impairment of Microlab s goodwill as
its fair value was estimated to be in excess of its carrying value. Furthermore, no events have occurred since then that would
change this assessment. 

NOTE 7 - ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE BASED
COMPENSATION   

The
Company follows the provisions of ASC 718,   Share-Based Payment.   The Company s results for the three and nine-month
periods ended September 30, 2016 include share-based compensation expense totaling $235,374 and $432,612, respectively. Results
for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015 included share-based compensation expense totaling $51,347 and $223,273,
respectively. Such amounts have been included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations within operating expenses.

Incentive Compensation Plan:   

In 2012, the Company s Board
of Directors and shareholders approved the 2012 Incentive Compensation Plan (the  Initial 2012 Plan ), which provides
for the grant of restricted stock awards, non-qualified stock options and incentive stock options in compliance with the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to employees, officers, directors, consultants and advisors of the Company who are expected to
contribute to the Company s future growth and success. When originally approved, the Initial 2012 Plan provided for the grant of
awards relating to 2,000,000 shares of common stock, plus those shares still available under the Company s prior incentive
compensation plan.

NOTE 7 - ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE BASED
COMPENSATION (Continued)   

In June 2014, the Company s shareholders
approved the Amended and Restated 2012 Incentive Compensation Plan (the  2012 Plan ) allowing for an additional 1,658,045
shares of the Company s common stock to be available for future grants under the 2012 Plan. As of September 30, 2016, there
were 1,261,001 shares available for issuance under the 2012 Plan, including those shares available under the Company s prior
incentive compensation plan as of such date. 

All service-based options granted have
ten-year terms from the date of grant and vest annually and become fully exercisable after a maximum of five years. Performance-based
options granted have ten-year terms and vest and become fully exercisable when determinable performance targets are achieved. Performance
targets are agreed to, and approved by, the Company s Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. 

Provisions of the 2012 Plan require
that all awards that are stock options be made at exercise prices equal to or greater than the fair market value on the date of
the grant. 

The
following summarizes the components of share-based compensation expense by equity type for the three and nine-months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015:  

Stock-based compensation for the three
and nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed
consolidated statement of operations. 

Restricted Common Stock Awards:   

On June 8, 2016, the Company granted
150,000 shares of restricted common stock to certain non-employee directors of the Company under the 2012 Plan. The shares were
granted at a price of $1.33 per share. On June 30, 2016, Timothy Whelan, the Company s newly appointed Chief Executive Officer,
forfeited the 30,000 shares of restricted common stock that were granted to him on June 8, 2016 as a non-employee director in connection
with his appointment as Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The remaining 120,000 shares of restricted common stock granted
on June 8, 2016 will fully vest on the date of the Company s next annual shareholders  meeting to be held in June 2017,
or a vesting period of approximately one year, provided that the director s service continues through the vesting date. The
total compensation expense to be recognized over the one-year vesting period with respect to the remaining 120,000 shares of restricted

A summary of the status of the Company s
non-vested restricted common stock, as granted under the Company s approved equity compensation plans, as of September 30,
2016, and changes during the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, are presented below: 

Under the terms of the performance-based
restricted common stock award agreements pertaining to the 87,000 shares of restricted stock granted to employees in 2013, the
awards will fully vest and become exercisable on the date on which the Company s Board of Directors shall have determined
that specific financial milestones have been met, provided the employee remains in the employ of the Company at such time; provided,
however, upon a Change in Control (as defined in the award agreements and the 2012 Plan), the restricted stock shall automatically
vest as permitted by the 2012 Plan. For the performance-based restricted stock awarded in 2013, the Company s Board of Directors
adopted specific revenue and earnings performance targets as vesting conditions. During the first quarter of 2015, management determined
the performance conditions related to these restricted stock awards are probable to be achieved by the year ending 2020. As a result,
the Company adjusted the amortization of the fair market value of these awards over the revised implicit service period from December
2017 to December 2020. If management determines in future periods the achievement of performance conditions are probable to occur
sooner than expected, the Company will accelerate the expensing of the unamortized balance as of that determination date. 

As of September 30, 2016, the unearned
compensation related to Company granted restricted common stock was $221,173 of which $119,700 (pertaining to 120,000 service-based
restricted common stock awards) will be amortized on a straight-line basis through the date of the Company s next annual
shareholders meeting scheduled to be held in June 2017, the vesting date, and $10,468 (pertaining to 8,333 service-based restricted
common stock awards) will be amortized on a straight-line basis through June 30, 2020, the date which they will have fully vested.
The remaining balance of $91,005 (pertaining to 87,000 performance-based shares of restricted common stock awarded in 2013) will
be amortized on a straight-line basis through December 31, 2020, the implicit service period.

On September 8, 2015, the Company granted
a performance-based stock option to a non-executive officer employee to acquire 50,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price
of $1.83 per share, which represented the closing price of the Company s common stock as reported on the NYSE MKT on the
date of grant. The per share fair-value of this performance-based option was $1.03. The per share fair-value was estimated on the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing method and included the following range of assumptions: dividend yield 0%,
risk-free interest rate of 1.53% and expected option life of 4 years. Volatility assumption was 75.46% and the forfeiture rate
was assumed to be 0%. 

Under the terms of the performance-based
stock option agreements granted prior to 2016, the awards will fully vest and become exercisable on the date on which the Company s
Board of Directors shall have determined that specific financial performance milestones have been met, provided the employee remains
in the employ of the Company at such time; provided, however, upon a Change in Control (as defined in the stock option agreements
and the 2012 Plan), the stock options shall automatically vest as permitted by the 2012 Plan. During the first quarter of 2015,
management determined the performance conditions related to the stock option awards granted in 2013 and grants made subsequent
thereto (but on or prior to the date of determination) are probable to be achieved by the year ending 2020. As a result, the Company
adjusted the amortization of the fair market value of these awards over the revised implicit service period from December 2017
to December 2020. If management determines in future periods the achievement of performance conditions are probable to occur sooner
than expected, the Company will accelerate the expensing of the unamortized balance as of that determination date. 

On May 16, 2016, the Company granted
a performance-based stock option to a non-executive officer employee to acquire 200,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price
of $1.36 per share, which represented the closing price of the Company s common stock as reported on the NYSE MKT on the
date of grant. The per share fair-value of this performance-based option was $0.78. The per share fair-value was estimated on the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing method and included the following range of assumptions: dividend yield 0%,
risk-free interest rate of 1.26% and expected option life of four years. The volatility assumption was 77.54% and the forfeiture
rate was assumed to be 0%. 

Under the terms of the performance-based
stock option agreement granted on May 16, 2016, the award will incrementally vest and become exercisable upon achievement of specific
annualized revenue targets in the Company s network solutions segment. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had not incurred
expense relating to this performance-based stock option as management determined it was more likely than not that the revenue targets
would not be achieved. 

As of September 30, 2016, the unearned
compensation related to the performance-based stock options to acquire 825,000 shares of common stock granted in August 2013 (with
a weighted average per share exercise price of $1.77) and the performance-based stock option to acquire 50,000 shares of common
stock granted in September 2015 (with a weighted average per share exercise price of $1.83) is $445,337 and $41,713, respectively,
which have been, and are expected to be, amortized on a straight-line basis through December 31, 2020, the implicit service period.
Unearned compensation in the amount of $155,810 related to the performance-based stock option granted in May 2016 (with a weighted
average per share exercise price of $1.36) will begin to be amortized when achievement of specific annualized revenue targets in
the Company s network solutions segment are determined to be probable. 

The Company s performance-based
stock options granted prior to 2013 (consisting of options to acquire 1,090,000 shares) are fully amortized.

The Company typically provides one-year warranties
on all of its products covering both parts and labor. The Company, at its option, repairs or replaces products that are defective
during the warranty period if the proper preventive maintenance procedures have been followed by its customers. Historically, the
Company s warranty expense has been minimal.

The following is a summary of the Company s
contractual obligations as of September 30, 2016: 

Table of Contractual Obligations  

Environmental Contingencies:   

In 1982, the Company and the New Jersey Department
of Environmental Protection (the  NJDEP ) agreed upon a plan to correct ground water contamination at a site, formerly
leased by Boonton, located in the Township of Parsippany-Troy Hills, pursuant to which wells have been installed by the Company.
The plan contemplates that the wells will be operated and that soil and water samples will be taken and analyzed until such time
that contamination levels are satisfactory to the NJDEP. In 2014, the Company received approval for a groundwater permit from the
NJDEP to carry out the final Remedial Action Work Plan and report. Under the final phase of the Remedial Action Work Plan, there
will be limited and reduced monitoring and testing as long as concentrations at the site continue on a decreasing trend. 

While management anticipates that the expenditures
in connection with this site will not be substantial in future years, the Company could be subject to significant future liabilities
and may incur significant future expenditures if further contaminants from Boonton s testing are identified and the NJDEP
requires additional remediation activities. Management is unable to estimate future remediation costs, if any, at this time. The
Company will continue to be liable under the plan, in all future years, until such time as the NJDEP releases it from all obligations
applicable thereto. 

At this time, the Company believes that
it is in material compliance with all environmental laws, does not anticipate any material expenditure to meet current or pending
environmental requirements, and generally believes that its processes and products do not present any unusual environmental concerns.
Besides the matter referred to above with the NJDEP, the Company is unaware of any existing, pending or threatened contingent liability
that may have a material adverse effect on its ongoing business operations. 

Line of Credit:   

The Company maintains a line of credit with
a bank. The credit facility provides borrowing availability of up to 100% of the Company s money market account balance and
99% of the Company s short-term investment securities (U.S. Treasury bills) and, under the terms and conditions of the loan
agreement, the facility is fully secured by the Company s money fund account and short-term investment holdings held with
the bank. Advances under the facility will bear interest at a variable rate equal to the London InterBank Offered Rate ( LIBOR )
in effect at the time of borrowing. Additionally, under the terms and conditions of the loan agreement, there is no annual fee
and any amount outstanding under the loan facility may be paid at any time in whole or in part without penalty. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had no
borrowings outstanding under the facility and approximately $4,500,000 of borrowing availability. The Company has no current plans
to borrow from this credit facility as it believes its present cash balances will adequately meet near-term working capital requirements.

INTRODUCTION   

The Company develops, manufactures and markets a wide
variety of electronic noise sources, electronic testing and measuring instruments including power meters, voltmeters and modulation
meters and high-power passive microwave components for wireless products. The majority of the Company s current business
relates to its network solutions products, which are primarily used by its customers in relation to commercial infrastructure development
in support of the expansion and upgrade to distributed antenna systems ( DAS ). In addition, the Company s products
are used to test the performance and capability of cellular/PCS and satellite communication systems and to measure the power of
radiofrequency (RF) and microwave systems. Other applications include radio, radar, wireless local area network (WLAN) and digital
television. 

The operating businesses of the Company are segregated
into two reportable segments: (1) network solutions and (2) test and measurement. The network solutions segment is comprised primarily
of the operations of the Company s subsidiary, Microlab. The test and measurement segment is comprised primarily of the Company s
operations (Noisecom) and the operations of its subsidiary, Boonton. Additional financial information on the Company s reportable
segments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, as well as for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 is included in Note 8 to the Company s interim condensed consolidated financial statements set forth in this current
report on Form 10-Q. 

The financial information presented herein includes: 

(i) Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September
30, 2016 (unaudited) and as of December 31, 2015; (ii) Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine-month
periods ended September 30, 2016 (unaudited) and 2015 (unaudited); (iii) Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the
nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 (unaudited) and 2015 (unaudited); and (iv) Condensed Consolidated Statement of Shareholders 
Equity for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 (unaudited). 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Management s discussion and analysis of the financial
condition and results of operations are based upon the Company s interim condensed consolidated financial statements, which
were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements required the Company to make estimates
and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities (including inventory valuation, accounts receivable, valuation
of deferred tax assets and estimated fair value of stock options) and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses for each period. 

ITEM 2 - MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  

On a regular basis, management evaluates its
assumptions, judgments and estimates. Management believes that there have been no material changes to the items that the
Company disclosed as its significant accounting policies and estimates under Item 7,  Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  in the Company s December 31, 2015 Form 10-K. 

The following represents a summary of the Company s
critical accounting policies, defined as those policies that the Company believes are: (a) the most important to the portrayal
of its financial condition and results of operations, and (b) that require management s most difficult, subjective or complex
judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. 

Share-Based Compensation   

The Company follows the provisions
of ASC 718,  Share-Based Payment.   The fair value of options at the date of grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model. For any performance-based or service-based options granted, the Company takes into consideration guidance
under ASC 718 and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) when reviewing and updating assumptions. The expected option
life is derived from assumed exercise rates based upon historical exercise patterns and represents the period of time that options
granted are expected to be outstanding. The expected volatility is based upon historical volatility of our shares using weekly
price observations over an observation period of three years. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve rate
in effect at the time of grant for periods similar to the expected option life. The estimated forfeiture rate included in the option
valuation is based on the Company s past history of forfeitures. Due to the limited amount of forfeitures in the past, the
Company s estimated forfeiture rate has been zero. 

Management estimates are necessary in determining compensation
expense for stock options with performance-based vesting criteria. Compensation expense for this type of stock-based award is recognized
over the period from the date the performance conditions are determined to be probable of occurring through the date the applicable
conditions are expected to be met. If the performance conditions are not considered probable of being achieved, no expense is recognized
until such time as the performance conditions are considered probable of being met, if ever. Management evaluates whether performance
conditions are probable of occurring on a quarterly basis. 

Revenue Recognition   

Revenue from product shipments, including shipping and
handling fees, is recognized once delivery has occurred provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is
fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of
loss have transferred to the customer. Revenues to international distributors are recognized in the same manner. If title does
not pass until the product reaches the customer s delivery site, then recognition of revenue is deferred until that time.
There are no formal revenue incentives offered to any of the Company s customers. Volume discounts may be offered from time
to time to customers purchasing large quantities on a per transaction basis. There are no material special post shipment obligations
or acceptance provisions that exist with any sales arrangements. 

Valuation of Inventory   

Raw material inventories are stated at the lower of
cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. Finished goods and work-in-process are valued at average cost of production, which
includes material, labor and manufacturing expenses. 

Reserve on Inventory   

The Company maintains reserves to reduce the value of
inventory to the lower of cost or market and reserves for excess and obsolete inventory. The Company reviews inventory for excess
and obsolescence based on its best estimates of future demand, product lifecycle status and product development plans. The Company
uses historical information along with those future estimates to reduce the inventory cost basis to its estimated realizable value. 

ITEM 2 - MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  

Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts   

The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts
for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. A key consideration in estimating
the allowance for doubtful accounts has been, and will continue to be, the Company s customers  payment history and
aging of its accounts receivable balance. If the financial condition of any of the Company s customers were to decline, additional
allowances may be required. 

Income Taxes   

The Company records deferred taxes in accordance with
ASC 740,   Accounting for Income Taxes .  This ASC requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities
for temporary differences between tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts at which they are carried in the financial
statements, based upon the enacted rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company establishes
a valuation allowance when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. 

The Company periodically assesses the value of its deferred
tax asset, a majority of which has been generated by a history of net operating losses and determines the necessity for a valuation
allowance. The Company evaluates which portion, if any, will more likely than not be realized by offsetting future taxable income,
taking into consideration any limitations that may exist on its use of its net operating loss carry-forwards. 

Uncertain Tax Positions   

Under ASC 740, the Company must recognize the tax benefit
from an uncertain position only if it is more-likely-than-not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authority,
based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements attributable to such position
are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon the ultimate resolution
of the position. 

The Company has analyzed its filing positions in all
of the Federal and state jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the Company has identified its U.S. Federal tax return and its state tax return in New Jersey as  major  tax
jurisdictions, as defined, in which it is required to file income tax returns. Based on the evaluations noted above, the Company
has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition or disclosure in its condensed consolidated
financial statements. 

Based on a review of tax positions for all open years
and contingencies as set out in the Company s notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements, no reserves for uncertain
income tax positions have been recorded pursuant to ASC 740 during the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the Company
does not anticipate that it is reasonably possible that any material increase or decrease in its unrecognized tax benefits will
occur within twelve months. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

The following discussion of our financial condition
and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our interim condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes
to those statements included in Part I, Item I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in conjunction with the consolidated financial
statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

For the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to the corresponding period of the previous year, consolidated net revenues were approximately $22,323,000 and $25,180,000, respectively,
a decrease of approximately $2,857,000 or 11.3%. For the three-months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding
period of the previous year, consolidated net revenues were approximately $8,344,000 and $8,339,000, respectively, a slight increase
of approximately $5,000. 

ITEM 2 - MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  

The decrease in consolidated net revenues for the nine-months
ended September 30, 2016 was the result of a decline in sales order flow for the Company s network solutions products, which
started in the second half of 2015 and continued through the first quarter of 2016, due to reductions in customer capital spending,
particularly by certain domestic wireless operators. The Company also experienced a decline in sales order flow during the first
quarter of 2016 in the Company s test and measurement segment, which was primarily due to a delay in the execution of orders
on government projects, which impacted sales orders for the first fiscal half of 2016. The slight increase in consolidated net
revenues for the three-months ended September 30, 2016 was the result of increased order flow in both of the Company s business
segments during the second and third quarters. During the three-months ended September 30, 2016, as expected, the Company realized
increased carrier and government spending on specific projects the Company was pursuing, which resulted in a 25% increase in sales
order flow (to approximately $11,200,000 across the Company s two business segments) during the three-months ended September
30, 2016 as compared to the sales order flow realized during the second quarter of 2016. 

The Company expects long-term demand for its network
solutions products to improve due to the continuing worldwide expansion of broadband coverage. Additionally, sales orders in the
Company s test and measurement segment increased during the three-months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the first
two quarters of 2016 primarily due to program funding by governmental agencies supporting radar applications. 

Net revenues of the Company s network solutions
products for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $15,197,000 as compared to approximately $16,708,000 for
the nine-months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $1,511,000 or 9.0%. Net revenues of network solutions products
accounted for approximately 68% and 66% of consolidated net revenues for each of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. Net revenues of the Company s network solutions products for the three-months ended September 30,
2016 were approximately $5,507,000 as compared to approximately $5,482,000 for the three-months ended September 30, 2015, an increase
of approximately $25,000 or 0.5%. Net revenues of network solutions products accounted for approximately 66% of consolidated net
revenues for each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Net revenues of the Company s test and measurement
products for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $7,126,000 as compared to approximately $8,472,000 for
the nine-months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $1,346,000 or 15.9%. Net revenues of test and measurement
products accounted for approximately 32% and 34% of consolidated net revenues for each of the nine-month periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net revenues of the Company s test and measurement products for the three-months ended September
30, 2016 were approximately $2,837,000 as compared to approximately $2,858,000 for the three-months ended September 30, 2015, a
slight decrease of approximately $21,000 or 0.7%. Net revenues of test and measurement products accounted for approximately 34%
of consolidated net revenues for each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Gross profit on net consolidated revenues for the nine-months
ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $9,882,000 or 44.3% as compared to approximately $11,053,000 or 43.9% of net consolidated
revenues for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015. Gross profit on net consolidated revenues for the three-months ended September
30, 2016 was approximately $3,823,000 or 45.8% as compared to approximately $3,623,000 or 43.4% of net consolidated revenues for
the three-months ended September 30, 2015. 

Gross profit margins are higher for the three and nine-months
ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period of the previous year. Consolidated gross profit margins increased due to
lower manufacturing labor costs during the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015,
offset by lower volumes. The decrease in manufacturing labor costs are primarily the result of the Company s cost reduction
plans implemented in August 2015. 

The Company s products consist of several models
with varying degrees of capabilities which can be customized to meet particular customer requirements. They may be incorporated
directly into the electronic equipment concerned or may be stand-alone components or devices that are connected to, or used in
conjunction with, such equipment from an external site, in the factory or in the field. Prices of products range from approximately
$100 to $100,000 per unit, with most sales occurring between approximately $2,000 and $35,000 per unit.  The
Company can experience variations in gross profit based upon the mix of these products sold as well as variations due to revenue
volume and economies of scale. The Company will continue to rigidly monitor costs associated with material acquisition, manufacturing
and production.  

ITEM 2 - MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  

Consolidated operating expenses for the nine-months
ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $10,888,000 or 49% of net consolidated revenues as compared to approximately $10,404,000
or 41% of net consolidated revenues for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015. Consolidated operating expenses were higher for
the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 due to increases in consolidated general and administrative expenses and consolidated
research and development expenses of approximately $549,000 and $143,000, respectively, offset by a decrease in consolidated sales
and marketing expenses of approximately $208,000. Consolidated operating expenses for the three-months ended September 30, 2016
were approximately $3,555,000 or 43% of net consolidated revenues as compared to approximately $3,461,000 or 42% of net consolidated
revenues for the three-months ended September 30, 2015. Consolidated operating expenses were higher for the three-months ended
September 30, 2016 due to an increase in consolidated general and administrative expenses of approximately $180,000, offset by
decreases in consolidated research and development expenses and sales and marketing expenses of approximately $78,000 and $8,000,
respectively. Consolidated operating expenses during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, included approximately $416,000 of professional fees related to the Company s Strategic Planning and Operating Committee s strategic evaluations. 

The increase in consolidated general and
administrative expenses for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to an increase in non-cash stock
compensation expense of approximately $209,000, an increase in administrative salaries of approximately $190,000, and an
increase in corporate legal fees. Consolidated research and development expenses increased for the nine-months ended
September 30, 2016 primarily due to an increase in costs associated with product development projects in both our network
solutions and test and measurement segments of approximately $230,000. Consolidated sales and marketing expenses decreased
for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to lower non-employee sales commissions and lower salary expenses,
offset by a slight increase in trade show expenses. 

The increase in consolidated general and administrative
expenses for the three-months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to an increase in non-cash stock compensation expense
of approximately $184,000. Consolidated research and development expenses increased for the three-months ended September 30, 2016
primarily due to an increase in costs associated with product development projects in both our network solutions and test and measurement
segments. Consolidated sales and marketing expenses decreased for the three-months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to lower
non-employee sales commission and lower salary expenses. 

Other expenses increased by approximately $21,000 and
$76,000 for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the corresponding periods of the previous year.
The increase is primarily due to increases in costs in connection with the Company s ground water management plan. 

For the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2016,
the Company recorded a tax expense of approximately $119,000 and a tax benefit of approximately $412,000, respectively. For the
three and nine-months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded a tax expense of approximately $81,000 and $293,000, respectively.
The tax benefit recorded for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to losses generated from the Company s
operations during the first six-months of 2016. The tax expense recorded for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2015
was primarily the result of income generated from the Company s operations and was predominantly comprised of a non-cash
deferred tax expense for Federal income taxes and a current provision for state income taxes for which the Company makes estimated
tax payments on a quarterly basis, when applicable. 

For the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
realized a net loss of approximately $673,000 or $0.04 loss per share on a basic and diluted basis, as compared to net income of
approximately $353,000 or $0.02 income per share on a basic and diluted basis for the corresponding period of the previous year,
a decrease of approximately $1,026,000. For the three-months ended September 30, 2016, the Company realized net income of approximately
$122,000 or $0.01 income per share on a basic and diluted basis, as compared to net income of approximately $75,000 or $0.00 income
per share on a basic and diluted basis for the corresponding period of the previous year, an increase of approximately $47,000.
The net income and loss fluctuations were primarily due to the factors discussed above. 

ITEM 2 - MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   

The Company s working capital has decreased by
approximately $1,034,000 to approximately $21,030,000 at September 30, 2016, from approximately $22,064,000 at December 31, 2015.
At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had a current ratio of 8.4 to 1 and 13.5 to 1, respectively. 

The Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately
$8,102,000 at September 30, 2016, compared to approximately $9,726,000 at December 31, 2015. The Company believes its current level
of cash and cash equivalents is sufficient to fund the current operating, investing and financing activities. 

The Company expects to realize tax benefits in future
periods due to the available net operating loss carryforwards resulting from the disposition of a former wholly-owned subsidiary
in 2010. Accordingly, future taxable income is expected to be offset by the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and
as a result, will increase the Company s liquidity as cash needed to pay Federal income taxes will be substantially reduced. 

The Company used cash for operating activities of approximately
$742,000 for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2016. The primary use of this cash was due to a net loss from operating
activities, an increase in inventories, an increase in accounts receivable, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current
assets, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. 

The Company provided cash from operating activities
of approximately $519,000 for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2015. The primary source of this cash was due to net income
from operations for the nine-month period, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets and an increase in accounts payable,
partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, an increase in accounts receivable and an increase
in inventories. 

The Company has historically been able to turn over
its accounts receivable approximately every two months. This average collection period has been sufficient to provide the working
capital and liquidity necessary to operate the Company. 

Net cash used for investing activities for the nine-months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $715,000 and $372,000, respectively. The use of these funds was for capital
expenditures. 

Cash used for financing activities for the nine-months
ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $167,000. The use of these funds was for periodic payments on an equipment lease and
the repurchase of 42,995 shares of the Company s outstanding common stock. Cash used for financing activities for the nine-months
ended September 30, 2015 was approximately $92,000. The use of these funds was for periodic payments on an equipment lease, partially
offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 

The stock repurchase program may continue to be modified or
re-initiated at any time. The Company will continue to monitor market conditions and evaluate opportunities to allocate its capital,
which may include the repurchasing of the Company s outstanding common stock. 

As of September 30, 2016, future minimum lease payments
related to the Company s facility lease and equipment leases are shown below: 

Table of Contractual Obligations  

ITEM 2 - MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  

The Company maintains a line of credit with a bank.
The credit facility provides borrowing availability of up to 100% of the Company s money market account balance and 99% of
the Company s short-term investment securities (U.S. Treasury bills) and, under the terms and conditions of the loan agreement,
the facility is fully secured by our money fund account and short-term investment holdings held with the bank. Advances under the
facility will bear interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR in effect at time of borrowing. Additionally, there is no annual
fee and any amount outstanding under the loan facility may be paid at any time in whole or in part without penalty. As of September
30, 2016, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the facility and approximately $4,500,000 of borrowing availability. 

The Company is currently pursuing strategic opportunities,
including potential acquisitions, mergers, divestitures or other activities, which may require significant use of the Company s
capital resources. These sources may include using operating cash , entering into asset-based lending arrangements with financial
institutions, entering into term loan agreements, or issuing the Company s common stock. Additionally, the Company may incur
costs as a result of such activities and such activities may affect the Company s liquidity in future periods. 

In 2015, the Company instituted cost reduction plans,
which reduced overall headcount and other operating expenses, to better position it to take advantage of growth opportunities.
The reduction in total headcount reduced annualized salary and benefit costs in 2015 by over $1,500,000, net of severance charges
of $137,000, which have been reinvested by the Company in its business to improve the strength of its management team and support
new product innovations. During the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, the Company continued its restructuring efforts by instituting
a plan to further reduce costs. As a result of this most recent effort, the Company expects to generate annualized cost reductions
of approximately $600,000, net of severance charges of $50,000, which are being reinvested in strategic initiatives. The Company
believes these cost reduction efforts, and continued diligent monitoring of its current operating expenses, will help position
the Company for growth and ongoing development of new products. 

The Company believes that its financial resources from
working capital are adequate to meet its current needs. However, should current global economic conditions deteriorate, additional
working capital funding may be required which may be difficult to obtain due to restrictive credit markets. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS   

The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

INFLATION AND SEASONALITY   

The Company does not anticipate that inflation will
significantly impact its business or its results of operations nor does it believe that its business is seasonal.

CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO   

   SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002   

I, Timothy Whelan, certify that: 

1. I have reviewed this quarterly
report on Form 10-Q of Wireless Telecom Group, Inc.; 

2. Based on my knowledge, this report
does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made,
in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
