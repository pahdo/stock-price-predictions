Note 1 - Description of Business and Basis of Presentation 

Description of business 

Callon Petroleum Company is an independent oil and natural gas company established in 1950. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in 1994 and succeeded to the business of a publicly traded limited partnership, a joint venture with a consortium of European investors and an independent energy company partially owned by a member of current management. As used herein, the  Company,   Callon,   we,   us,  and  our  refer to Callon Petroleum Company and its predecessors and subsidiaries unless the context requires otherwise. 

Callon is focused on the acquisition, development, exploration and exploitation of unconventional onshore, oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin in West Texas. The Company s operations to date have been predominantly focused on horizontal drilling of several prospective intervals, including multiple levels of the Wolfcamp formation and, more recently, the Lower Spraberry shale   in the Midland Basin  . Callon has assembled a multi-year inventory of potential horizontal well locations and intends to add to this inventory through delineation drilling of emerging zones on   its   existing acreage and acquisition of additional locations through   working interest acquisitions,   acreage purchases, joint ventures and asset swaps.    

Basis of presentation 

Unless otherwise indicated, all dollar amounts included within the Footnotes to the Financial Statements are presented in thousands, except for per share and per unit data. 

The interim consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with (1) GAAP, (2) the SEC s instructions to Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and (3) Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X, and include the accounts of   Callon Petroleum   Company, and its subsidiary, Callon Petroleum Operating Company ( CPOC ). CPOC also has subsidiaries, namely Callon Offshore Production, Inc. and Mississippi Marketing, Inc. 

These interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . The balance sheet at   December 31, 2015   has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date. Operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended   December 31, 2016  . 

In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments and all intercompany account and transaction eliminations, necessary to present fairly the Company s financial position, the results of its operations and its cash flows   for the periods indicated.   Certain prior year amounts   may   have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. 

Recently issued accounting policies 

In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued accounting standards update No. 2016-09,   Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718):   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ).   The standard is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows, and will allow companies to estimate the number of stock awards expected to vest. The guidance in ASU 2016-09 is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted and is to be applied on retrospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the method of adoption and impact this standard may have on its financial statements and related disclosures.

Table of Contents   

In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued accounting standards update No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ).   The objective of the standard is to reduce the existing diversity in practice of several cash flow issues, including debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with   c  oupon rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, contingent consideration payment made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies, distributions received from equity method investees, beneficial inter  e  sts in securitization transactions, and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle  .   The guidance in ASU 2016-15 is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted and is to be applied on retrospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the method of adoption and impact this standard may have on its financial statements and related disclosures. 

Recently adopted accounting policies 

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes   ( ASU 2015-17 ), which eliminates the current requirement to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent amounts on the balance sheet. Instead, entities will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The guidance in ASU 2015-17 is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early application is permitted. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company adopted this ASU, which does not have a material impact on its financial state  ments. 

Note 2   Oil and Natural Gas Properties 

The Company uses the full cost method of accounting for its exploration and development activities.     Under this method of accounting, the cost of both successful and unsuccessful exploration and development activities are capitalized as oil and gas properties. Such amounts include the cost of drilling and equipping productive wells, dry hole costs, lease acquisition costs, delay rentals, interest capitalized on unevaluated leases, other costs related to exploration and development activities, and site restoration, dismantlement and abandonment costs capitalized in accordance with asset retirement obligation accounting guidance. Costs capitalized also include any internal costs that are directly related to exploration and development activities, including salaries and benefits, but do not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. 

Under full cost accounting rules, the Company reviews the carrying value of its proved oil and natural gas properties each quarter. Under these rules, capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization and deferred income taxes, may not exceed the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves, discounted at 10%, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unevaluated properties, net of related tax effects (the full cost ceiling). These rules   r  equire pricing based on the preceding 12-months  average oil and natural gas prices based on closing prices on the first day of each month and require a write-down if the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties exceeds the full cost ceiling. At   September 30, 2016  , the   average realized   prices used in determining the estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves were   $  38.92   per barrel of oil and   $2.53   per Mcf of natural gas.   For the three months ended   September 30, 2016     no     write-down of oil and natural gas properties was recognized   as a result of the ceiling test limitation.   F  or the     nine   months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized   a    write-down of oi  l and natural gas properties of     $95,788     as a result of the ceiling test limitation. 

Note 3 - Acquisitions    

Acquisitions were accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting, which involves determining the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed under the income approach.

2016 acquisitions 

On August 3, 2016, the Company entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement for the acquisition of an addition  al   4.0%   working interest (  3.0%   net revenue interest) in the Casselman-Bohannon fields for total cash consideration o  f    $13,000  ,   excluding customary purchase price adjustments. Following the completion of this acquisition the Company will own approximately   75.3%   working interest (  58.5%   net revenue interest) in the Casselman-Bohannon fields.     The following table summarizes the estimated acquisition date fair values of the net assets to be acquired in the acquisition: 

On   May   26  , 2016, the Company completed the acquisition     of   17,298   gross (  14,089   net) acres primarily located in Howard County, Texas from   BSM Energy LP, Crux Energy LP and Zaniah Energy LP  , for   total cash consideration     of   $  220,000   and   9,333,333   shares of common stock   for a total purchase price of $  329,573  ,    excluding   customary purchase price adjust  ments   (the  Big Star Transaction )  . The Company   acquired   an   81%   average working interest (  61%   average net revenue interest) in the   properties acquired in the     Big Star Transaction  . 

The preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to change based on numerous factors, including the final adjusted purchase price and the final estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any such adjustments to the preliminary estimates of fair value could be material. The following table summarizes the estimated acquisition date fair values of the net assets to be acquired in the   a  cquisition: 

The following unaudited summary pro forma financial information fo  r the three and   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 has   been presented for illustrative purposes only and do  e  s not purport to represent what the Company s results of operations would have been if the Big Star Transaction had occurred as presented, or to project the Company s results of operations for any future periods. The pro forma financial information was prepared assuming the Big Star Transaction occurred as of January 1, 201  5  . The pro forma adjustments are based on available information and certain assumptions that management believes are reasonable, includ  ing   those pertaining to   revenue, lease operating expenses, production taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense,   write-down of oil and natural gas properties,   accretion expense, interest expense and capitalized interest.    

From the date of the acquisition through the period ende  d    September   30, 2016, the properties asso  ciated   with the Big Star Transaction have been comingled with our existing properties and it is impractical to provide the stand-alone operational results related to these properties. 

O  n     May 16  , 2016, the Company   completed   the following transactions (collectively, the  AMI Transaction )   for an aggregate   net   cash   purchase price   of   $  33,012  ,    excluding     customary purchase price adjustments.   Key elements of the AMI Transaction include: 

Formation of an area of mutual interest with TRP Energy, LLC ( TRP ) in western Reagan County, Texas, through the joint acquisition from a private party of   4,745   net acres (with a   55%   share to Callon) north of the Garrison Draw field; and     

Callon s simultaneous sale of a   27.5  %   interest in the Garrison Draw field to TRP.

On January 18, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of an additional   4.9%   working interest (  3.7%   net revenue interest) in the Ca  sselman-Bohannon fields for an aggregate   cash   purchase price   of   $  10,183  ,    including   customary purchase price adjustments. The following table summarizes the acquisition date fair values of the net assets acquired, including customary purchase price adjustments: 

Subsequent event    

On October 20, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of   6,904   gross (  5,952   net) acres primarily located in Howard County, Texas fr  om   P  l  ymouth Petroleum, LLC   and additional sellers that exercised their  tag-along  sales rights,   for t  otal cash consideration   of   $340,686  ,   exclu  ding customary purchase pric  e adjustments (the    Plymouth     Transaction   ). The Company funded the cash purchase price with the net proceeds of an equity offering   (see Note 10 for additional information regarding the equity offering). The Company acquired an   82%   average working interest (  62%   average net revenue interest) in the properties acquired in   the   Plymouth     Transaction  .     In September 2016  ,   in connection with the execution of the purchase and sale agreement for the Plymouth   Transaction  ,   the Company paid a deposit in the amount of $  32,700   to a third party escrow agent, which was recorded as   Acquisition deposit on the balance sheet as of September 30, 2016.

Note 5 - Borrowings 

The Company s borrowings consisted of the following at: 

Senior secured revolving credit facility (the  Credit Facility ) 

On March 11, 2014, the Company entered into the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to the Credit Facility with a maturity date   of   March 11, 2019  .    JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is Administrative Agent, and participa  nts include several institutional   lenders.   The total notional amount available under the Credit Facility is     $500,000  . Amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility may not exceed the borrowing base, which is generally reviewed on a semi-annual basis. As of   September 30, 2016  ,    the Credit Facility s borrowing base was   $385,000  . The Credit Facility is secured by first preferred mortgages covering the Company s major producing properties.    

Effecti  ve July 13, 2016, the Credit Facility s borrowing base was increased to   $385,000     and the Com  pany s capacity to hedge oil and natural gas volumes was effectively increased with a change in the capacity calculation to a percentage of total proved reserves from proved producing reserves. In addition, the interest rate for borrowings under the Credit Facility was increased   0.25%   across all tiers of the pricing grid, resulting in a range of interest costs equal to LIBOR plus   2.00%   to   3.00%  . There were no modifications to other terms or covenants of the Credit Facility. 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the  re was     no     balance outstanding on the Credit Facility  .   For the   quarter   ended   September 30, 2016  , t  he Credit Facility had a   weighted-average interest rate of   2.92%  , calculated as the LIBOR plus a tiered rate ranging from   2.00%   to   3.00%  , which is determined based on utilization of the facility. In addition, the Credit Facility carries a commitment fee of   0.5%   per annum, payable quarterly, on the unused portion of the borrowing   base. 

Secured second lien term loan (the  Term Loan   ) 

On October 8, 2014, the Company entered into the Term Loan with an aggregate amount of up to   $300,000   and a maturity date of   October 8, 2021  . The Royal Bank of Canada is Administrative Agent, and participants include several institutional lenders. The Term Loan may be prepaid at the Company s option, subject to a prepayment premium.   The prepayment amount   would be   (i)     102%   of principal   if the prepayment event occur  red   prior to October 8, 2016,   (ii)     101%     of principal   if the prepayment event occur  red   on or after October 8, 201  6  ,    but before October 8, 201  7  , and (ii  i  ) 100%   of principal   for prepayments made on or after October 8, 201  7  . The Term Loan   wa  s secured by junior liens on properties mortgaged under the Credit Facility, subject to an intercreditor agr  eement. 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the balance outstanding on the Term Loan was   $300,000   with an interest rate of   8.5%  , calculated at a rate of LIBOR     (subject to a floor rate of   1.0%  ) plus   7.5%   per annum.   The Company elect  ed   a LIBOR   rate based on various tenors  , and   wa  s     incurring interest based on an underlying   three-month LIBOR   rate  , which was last elected in   July 2016  . 

Restrictive covenants 

The Company s Credit Facility and Term Loan contain various covenants including restrictions on additional indebtedness, payment of cash dividends and maintenance of certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with these covenants at   September 30, 2016  . 

Subsequent   e  vents 

On October 3, 2016, the Company closed   the sale   of   $400,000   aggregate principal amount of   6.125%   senior unsecured notes due 2024 (the    S  enior   Notes   ) at an issue price of   100%   of the aggregate principal amount of the   Senior   Notes. The Notes will mature on   October 1, 2024  , unless redeemed in accordance with their terms prior to such date. The net proceeds of the offering, after deducting initial purchasers  discounts and estimated offering expenses, were approximately   $391,  270  . The   Senior   Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, Callon Petroleum Operating Company, and may be guaranteed by certain future subsidiaries. Interest on the   Senior   Notes is payable semi-annually.

On October 1  1  , 2016, the Term Loan was repaid in full   at the prepayment rate of   101%     using proceeds from the   sale of the     Senior   Notes,   which is expected to   result in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of   $1  2,851   (inclusive of   $3,000   in prepayment fees and   $9,851   of unamortized debt issuance costs). 

Note 6 - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 

Objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments 

The Company is exposed to fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices received for its production. Consequently, the Company believes it is prudent to manage the variability in cash flows on a portion of its oil and natural gas production. The Company utilizes a mix of collars, swaps, puts, calls and similar derivative financial instruments to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in commodity prices. The Company does not use these instruments for speculative or trading purposes. 

Counterparty risk and offsetting 

The use of derivative instruments exposes the Company to the risk that a counterparty will be unable to meet its commitments. While the Company monitors counterparty creditworthiness on an ongoing basis, it cannot predict sudden changes in counterparties  creditworthiness. In addition, even if such changes are not sudden, the Company may be limited in its ability to mitigate an increase in counterparty credit risk. Should one of these counterparties not perform, the Company may not realize the benefit of some of its derivative instruments under lower commodity prices while continuing to be obligated under higher commodity price contracts subject to any right of offset under the agreements. Counterparty credit risk is considered when determining the fair value of a derivative instrument;   see     Note 7   for additional information   regarding fair value. 

The Company executes commodity derivative con  tracts under master agreements with   netting provisions that provide for offsetting assets against liabilities. In general, if a party to a derivative transaction incurs an event of default, as defined in the applicable agreement, the other party will have the right to demand the posting of collateral, demand a cash payment transfer or terminate the arrangement. 

Financial statement presentation and settlements 

Settlements of the Company s derivative instruments are based on the difference between the contract price or prices specified in the derivative instrument and a benchmark price, such as the NYMEX price. To determine the fair value of the Company s derivative instruments, the Company utilizes present value methods that include assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets.   See   Note 7   for additional information regarding fair value. 

Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments 

The Company records its derivative contracts at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet  s   and records changes in fair value as a gain or loss on derivative contracts in the consolidated statement  s   of operations. Cash settlements are also recorded as gain or loss on derivative contracts in the consolidated statement  s   of operations. 

The following table reflects the fair value of the Company s derivative instruments for the periods presented:

Note 7 - Fair Value Measurements 

The fair value hierarchy included in GAAP gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs, which consist of unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Level 2 inputs consist of quoted prices for similar instruments. Level 3 valuations are derived from inputs that are significant and unobservable, and these valuations have the lowest priority. 

Fair value of financial instruments 

Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted investments.   The carrying amounts for these instruments approximate fair value due to the short-term nature or maturity of the instruments. 

Debt.   The carrying amount of the Company s floating-rate debt approximated fair value because the interest rates were variable and reflective of market rates.    

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis 

Certain assets and liabilities are reported at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated balance sheet. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate fair value: 

Commodity derivative instruments.   The fair value of commodity derivative instruments is derived using an income approach valuation model that utilizes market-corroborated inputs that are observable over the term of the derivative contract. The Company s fair value calculations also incorporate an estimate of the counterparties  default risk for derivative assets and an estimate of the Company s default risk for derivative liabilities. The Company believes that the majority of the inputs used to calculate the commodity derivative instruments fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy based on the wide availability of quoted market prices for similar commodity derivative contracts.   See   Note 6   for additional information regarding the Company s derivative instruments. 

The following tables present the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis: 

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 

Acquisition  s  .    As discussed in Note 3, the Company completed   four     acquisition  s   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The Company determined the fair value of the assets acquired using the income approach based on expected future cash flows from estimated reserve quantities, costs to produce and develop reserves, and oil and   natural   gas forward prices. The fair value measurements were based on   L  evel 2 and   L  evel   3 inputs. 

Note 8 - Income Taxes 

The Company typically provides for income taxes at a statutory rate of     35  %     adjusted for permanent differences expected to be realized, which primarily relate to non-deductible executive compensation expenses and state income taxes. As a result of the write-down of oil and natural gas proper  ties in the latter part of 2015   and first half of 2016  ,    the Company incurred a cumulative     three     year loss. Because of the impact the cumulative loss has on the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets through future earnings, the Company assessed the ability to realize its deferred tax assets based on the future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, the Company established a valuation allowance for a portion of the deferred tax asset. The valuation allowance was     $139,633     as of   September 30, 2016  .

Note 9 - Asset Retirement Obligations 

The table below summarizes the Company s asset retirement obligations activity for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  :   

Certain of the Company s operating agreements require that assets be restricted for abandonment obligations. Amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at   September 30, 2016   as long-term restricted investments were   $3,329  . These assets, which primarily include short-term U.S. Government securities, are held in abandonment trusts dedica  ted to pay future abandonment costs. 

Note 10 - Equity Transactions 

10% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock ( Preferred Stock ) 

Holders of the Company s Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends at a rate of   10.0%   per annum of the   $50.00   liquidation preference per share (equivalent to   $5.00   per annum per share). Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors. Preferred Stock dividends were   $1,824     an  d    $1,974    f  or   the three months ended   September 30, 2016     and   2015  ,    respectively  , and   $5,471   and   $5,921   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016     and   2015  ,    respectively  . 

The Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or other mandatory redemption. On or after May 30, 2018, the Company may, at its option, redeem the Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, by paying $50.00 per share   in cash  , plus any accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date. 

Following a change of control   in which the Company or the acquirer no longer have a class of common securities listed on a national exchange  , the Company will have the option to redeem the Preferred Stock, in whole but not in part for $50.00 per share in cash, plus accrued and unpaid dividends (whether or not declared), to the redemption date. If the Company does not exercise its option to redeem the Preferred Stock upon   such   change of control, the holders of the Preferred Stock have the option to convert the Preferred Stock into a number of shares of the Company s common stock based on the value of the common stock on the date of the change of control as determined under the certificate of designations for the Preferred Stock. If the change of control occurred on   September 30, 2016  , and the Company did not exercise its right to redeem the Preferred Stock, using the closing price of $  15.70   as the value of a share of common stock, each share of Preferred Stock would be convertible into approximately   3.2   shares of common stock. If the Company exercises its redemption rights relating to shares of Preferred Stock, the holders of Preferred Stock will not have the conversion right described above. 

On   February 4  , 2016  ,    the Company exchanged   a total of   120,000   shares of Preferred Stock   f  or   719,000   shares of common stock.   As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   1,458,948     shares   of its Preferred Stock issued and outstanding. 

Common   s  tock       

On March   9  , 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of   15,250,000   shares of its common stock   for total   net proceeds   (after the underwriting discounts and estimated offering costs)   of approximately   $  94,973  .     Proceeds from the offering were used to pay down the balance on the Company s Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes. 

On April 25, 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of   25,300,000   shares of its common stock for total net proceeds (after the underwriter s discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses) of approximately   $  205,869  . Proceeds from the offering were used to fund the   May   2016   Big Star Transaction and AMI Transaction,   described in Note 3.  

On May 26, 2016, the Company issued   9,333,333   shares of common stock to   partially fund the Big Star Transaction, described in   Note 3  ,    at an assumed offering price of   $  11.74   per share, which is the last reported sale price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on   that date  .

Note 11 - Other 

Operating leases 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had contracts for   two   horizontal drilling rigs (the  Cactus 1 Rig  and  Cactus 2 Rig ).   The   contract   terms of   the   Cactus 1 Rig and Cactus 2 Rig   will   end in July 2018 and August 2018, respectively.     The rig lease agreements include early termination provisions that obligate the Company to   pay   reduced minimum rentals for the   remaining   term of the agreement. These payments would be reduced assuming the lessor is able to re-charter the rig and staffing personnel to another l  essee.     In January 2016, the Company place  d   its Cactus 1 Rig on standby and   wa  s required to pay a  standby  day     rate of $  15,000   per day, pursuant   to the terms of the agreement  ,    a  llowing   the Company   to   retain the option to return the rig to service   under the contract terms  .   In August 2016, the Company returned its Cactus 1 Rig to service. 

Subsequent event 

In October 2016 the Company entered into a contract for a horizontal drilling rig (the  Cactus 3 Rig ). The contract term will begin   January 2017   through   June 2017   with a day rate of   $16,000   per day.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

General 

The following management s discussion and analysis describes the principal factors affecting the Company s results of operations, liquidity, capital resources and contractual cash obligations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K, which include additional information about our business practices, significant accounting policies, risk factors, and the transactions that underlie our financial results. Our   w  ebsite address is   www.callon.com  . All of our filings with the SEC are available free of charge through our   w  ebsite as soon as reasonably practicable after we file them wit  h, or furnish them to, the SEC. Information on our   w  ebsite does not form part of this report on Form 10-Q. 

We are an independent oil and natural gas company established in 1950. We are focused on the acquisition, development, exploration and exploitation of unconventional, onshore, oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin in West Texas, and more specifically, the Midland Basin. Our operating culture is centered on responsible development of hydrocarbon resources, safety and the environment, which we believe strengthens our operational performance. Our drilling activity is predominantly focused on the horizontal development of several prospective intervals, including multiple levels of the Wolfcamp formation and, more recently, the Lower Spraberry shale. We have assembled a multi-year inventory of potential horizontal well locations and intend to add to this inventory through delineation drilling of emerging zones on our existing acreage and acquisition of additional locations through   working interest acquisitions,   acreage purchases, joint ventures and asset swaps.     Our production was approximately   77%   oil and   23%   natural gas for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . On   September 30, 2016  , our   net   acreage position in the Permian Basin was approximatel  y    34,199   net acres  .    

Commodity Prices 

The prices for oil and natural gas remain extremely volatile and sometimes experience large fluctuations as a result of relatively small changes in supply, weather conditions, economic conditions and actions by   the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries   and other countries and government actions. Prices of oil and natural gas will affect the following aspects of our business: 

our revenues, cash flows and earnings;     

the amount of oil and natural gas that we are economically able to produce;     

our ability to attract capital to finance our operations and cost of the capital;     

the amount we are allowed to borrow under our senior secured revolving credit facility; and     

the value of our oil and natural gas properties.     

Beginning in the second half of 2014, the NYMEX price for a barrel of oil declined from   $105.37   on June 30, 2014 t  o    $48.70   on     October 28, 2016  . For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the average NYMEX price for a barrel of oil was   $44.94   per Bbl compared to   $46.41   per Bbl for the same period of   2015  . The NYMEX price for a barrel of oil ranged from a low of   $39.51   per Bbl to a high of   $48.99   per Bbl for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .   

For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the average NYMEX price for natural gas was   $2.81   per MMBtu compared to   $2.77   per MMBtu for the same period in   2015  . The NYMEX price for natural gas ranged from a low of   $2.55   per MMBtu to a high of   $3.06   per MMBtu for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 

The Company uses the full cost method of accounting for its exploration and development activities. Under full cost accounting rules, the Company reviews the carrying value of its proved oil and natural gas properties each quarter. Under these rules, capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization and deferred income taxes, may not exceed the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves, discounted at 10%, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unevaluated properties, net of related tax effects (the full cost ceiling). These rules generally require pricing based on the preceding 12-months  average oil and natural gas prices based on closing prices on the first day of each month and require a write-down if the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties exceeds the full cost ceiling. At   September 30, 2016  , the   realized   prices used in determining the estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves were   $38.92   per barrel of oil and   $2.53   per Mcf of natural gas   (including the value of NGLs in the natural gas stream)  .    For the three months ended September 30, 2016  ,   no write-down of oil and natural gas properties was recognized as a result of the cei  ling test limitation.     For the   nine   months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized a write-down of oil and natural gas properties   of   $95.8   million     as a result of the ceiling test limitation.   If commodity prices   were to   decline  , we   could   incur additional ceiling test write-downs in the future. However, we do not expect such prevailing commodity prices to have significant adverse effects on our proved oil and gas reserves. See     Note 2   in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for more information.

The table below presents   the cumulative   results of the full cost ceiling test   for 2016   as of   September 30, 2016  , along with various pricing scenarios to demonstrate the sensitivity of our full cost ceiling to changes in 12-month average oil and natural gas prices. This sensitivity analysis is as of   September 30, 2016  ,    and accordingly, does not consider drilling results, production, changes in oil and natural gas prices, and changes in future development and operating costs subsequent to   September 30, 2016   that may require revisions to our proved reserve estimates and resulting estimated future net cash flows used in the full cost ceiling test. 

Operational Highlights 

Our production   grew     70%    a  nd   53%     for   the three   and   nine     months ended   September 30, 2016  ,    respectively,   compared to the same period  s   of   2015  ,    in  creasing to   1,527   MBOE from   896   MBOE     and     3,884   MBOE from   2,533   MBOE   for the comparative three   and   nine     month period  s, respectively  . 

For   the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   we drill  ed   eight g  ross (  5.4   net) horizontal wells   and   completed   11   gross (  6.8   net) horizontal wells. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we drilled   19   gross (  13.4   net) horizontal wells and completed   25   gross (  17.3   net) horizontal wells. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   three g  ross (  2.8   net)   horizontal wells awaiting completion. 

As of   September 30, 2016  ,    we h  ad   419   gross (  335   net) working interest oil wells,   three g  ross (  0.1   net) royalty interest oil wells and no   natural gas wells.   A well is categorized as an oil well or a natural gas well based upon the ratio of oil to natural gas reserves on a BOE basis. However, most of our wells produce both oil and natura  l gas. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Historically, our primary sources of capital have been cash flows from operations, borrowings from financial institutions, the sale of debt and equity securities and asset dispositions. Our primary uses of capital have been for the acquisition, development, exploration and exploitation of oil and natural gas properties, in addition to refinancing of debt instruments.  

During   the first nine months of   2016,   we completed   four     public   common stock offerings to raise additional capital, and we continue to evaluate other sources of capital to complement our cash flows from operations as we pursue our long-term growth plan  s  . As of   September 30, 2016  , there was     no     balance outstanding on the Credit Facility  , which has a   borrowing base   of   $3  85   million.   Subsequent to the third quarter of 2016, we completed one debt offering, the proceeds of which were used to repay amounts borrowed under our Term Loan and for general corporate purposes. 

For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , cash and cash equivalents   in  crease  d    $324.7   million to   $325.9   million compared to   $1.2   million   at   December 31, 2015  .     As of October 28, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents balance w  as   $100.8   mi  llion following the closing of the Plymouth Transaction, offering of Senior Notes and repayment of the Term Loan.

Liquidity and cash flow  

Operating     activities.   For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , net cash   provided by o  perating activities wa  s    $49.9   mi  llion compared to   net cash provided by operating activities of     $55.5   million for the same period in   2015  . The change was predominantly attributable to the following: 

A  n     increase in revenue offset by   a    decrease     on settlement  s   of derivative cont  racts  ;     

An increase in certain operating expenses related to   acquired properties;        

An increase in payments on cash-settled restricted stock unit ( RSU ) awards;      

A decrease in payments related to nonrecurring early retirement expenses that were incurred in 2015;      

A payment of a secured deposit related to   the Plymouth Transaction   that closed subsequent to September 30, 2016;   and     

A change related to the timing of working capital payments and receipts.     

Production, realized prices, and operating expenses are discussed below in Results of Operations.

Investing activities.   For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , net cash used in investing activities was   $401.8   million compared to   $178.2   million for the same period in   2015  . The   $223.6   million   in  crease in cash used in investing   activities was primarily attributable to the following: 

A    $67.5   millio  n decrease in operational expenditures due to the transition from a two-rig to a one-rig program in January 2016,   offset in part by   the release of a vertical rig in April 2015   and   the transition back to a two-rig program in August 2016  ;    a  nd     

A     $276.6     million increase   in   acquisitions, net of proceeds from the sale of mineral interest and equipm  ent, during the   nine months ended   months   September 30, 2016  . The acquisitions were funded with cash and common stock.

activities was   $676.6   million compared to cash provided by financing activities of   $123.6   million during the same period of   2015  .     The change in net cash provided by financing activities   was primarily attributable to the following: 

Payments, net of borrowings, on our Credit Facility   w  ere   $40 million  ,    $104   million less than the same period of 2015; and     

A    $657.2   million increase in proceeds resulting from common stock offering  s   in March  ,   April  , and September   2016 as compared to proceeds resulting from   a   common stock offering in March 2015.

Operational Capital Budget and   Third   Quarter Summary 

In early   August   201  6, we   a  nnounced an increase of   our op  erational capital guidance   to $  14  0   mi  llion. The increased guidance reflects expenditures related to the   r  e  activation   of   our idled   second   drilling   rig   that will be     primarily in the WildHorse operating area  ,     and increased infrastructure investments to accommodate   future program   development   plans   in this area  .   

Operational capital expenditures on an accrual basis   were   $99.3   million for the   nine     months ended   September 30, 2016  .     In addition to the operational capital expenditures,   $15.1     million of capitalized general and administrative   and   $13.2   million of   capitalized interest   expenses were accrued in the   nine     months ended   September 30, 2016  .    

Based upon current commodity price expectations for 2016, we believe that our cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our Credit Facility will be s  ufficient to fund our remaining 2016 capital program, including working capital requirements.

Revenues 

The following t  able reconcile  s   the change in oil, natural gas and total revenue for the respective periods presented by reflecting the effect of changes in volume and the underlying commodity prices. 

Oil revenue    

For the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , oil revenues of   $49.1   million   in  creased     $18.5   million, or   61%  , compared to revenues of   $30.6   million for the same period of   2015  .    T  he   in  crease   in oil revenue was   primarily attributable to a     67%   increase in production offset by a     4%   decrease in the average realized sales price  , which fell to   $42.58   per Bbl from   $44.39   per Bbl  .    The increase in production was comprised of   353   MBbls attributable to wells placed on production as a result of our horizontal drilling program and   307   MBbls attributable to producing wells   added   from our acquired properties. Offsetting these increases were normal   and   expected declines from our existing wells.     

For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , oil revenues of   $117.1   million   in  creased   $22.5   million, or   24%  , compared to revenues of   $94.6   million for the same period of   2015  . The   in  crease in oil revenue was primarily attributable to   a    49%   increase in production, and was predominantly offset by   a    17%   decrease in the average realized sales price, which fell to   $39.12   per Bbl from   $47.01   per Bbl.   The increase in production was comprised of   979   MBbls attributable to wells placed on production as a result of our horizontal drilling program and   397   MBbls attributable to producing wells   added   from our acquired properties. Offsetting these increases were normal and expected declines from our existing wells  . 

See   Note 3   in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company s acquisitions. 

Natural gas revenue (including NGLs) 

Natural gas revenues of   $6.8   million   in  creased   $3.1   million, or   83%  , during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  ,    compared to   $3.7   million for the same period of   2015  . The   in  crease primarily relates to   a    81%   increase in natural gas volumes  , while the   average   realized   price   was consistent at     $3.04   per Mcf   as compared to     $3.01   per Mcf   for the prior comparative quarter of 2015  , reflecting   both natural gas and natural gas liquids prices  .     The increase in production was comprised of   529   MMcf attributable to wells placed on production as a result of our horizont  al drilling program and   452    M  Mcf   attributable to producing wells   added   from our acquired properties. Offsetting these increases were and normal expected declines from our existing wells. 

Natural gas revenues of   $14.7   million increased   $5.3   million, or   57%  , during the   nine months ended  ,    September 30, 2016  ,    compared to   $9.4   million for the same period of   2015  . The increase primarily relates to a   71%   increase in natural gas volumes and was predominantly offset by a  n     8%   decrease in the average price realized, which fell to   $2.75   per Mcf from   $3.00   per Mcf, reflecting decreases in both natural gas and natural gas liquids prices.   The increase in production was comprised of   1,252   MMcf attributable to wells placed on production as a result of our horizont  al drilling program and   622   MMcf attributable to producing wells   added   from our acquired properties.   Offsetting these increases were normal and expected declines from our existing wells.

O  perating Expenses 

nm = not meaningful 

Lease operating expenses.   These are daily costs incurred to extract oil and natural gas, together with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties. Such costs also include maintenance, repairs  , gas treating fees   and workover expenses related to our oil and natural gas properties.    

For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  ,    LOE   in  creased by   38%   to     $10.0   million   compared to   $7.2   million for     the same period of   2015  .    Contributing to the increase for the current quarter was   $3.0   million related to   oil and natural gas   properties acquired during the second quarter of 2016 (see   Note 3   in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements).   Excluding LOE related to   these acquired   properties, LOE decreased by   $0.2   million, or   3%  , compared to the same period of 2015.   F  or the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , LOE per BOE   decreased to     $6.52     per BOE   compared to     $8.03   per BOE for the same period of   2015  ,    which was   primarily   attributable   to   improving   operational efficiency and working with our service partners to achieve cost reduction  s  .     Higher production volumes   also   contributed to the   19%   per BOE decrease for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  .     The increase in production was primarily attributable to an increased number of producing wells   from our horizontal drilling program and acquisitions   as discussed above.    

For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , LOE   in  creased by   17%   to   $24.2   million compared to   $20.7   million for   the same period of   2015  .    Contributing to the increase for the current period was   $3.8   million related to   oil and natural gas   properties acquired during the second quarter of 2016 (see   Note 3   in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements).     Excluding LOE related to   these acquired   properties, LOE decreased by   $0.  3   million, or   1  %  , compared to the same period of 2015.     For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , LOE per BOE decreased to   $6.24   per BOE compared to   $8.18   per BOE for the same period of   2015  , which was primarily attributable to   improving   operational efficiency   and   working with our service partners to achieve cost reductions  . Higher production volumes also contributed to the   24%   per BOE decrease for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .     The increase in production was primarily attributable to an increased number of producing wells   from our horizontal drilling program and acquisitions   as discussed above. 

Production taxes.   Production taxes include severance and ad valorem taxes. In general, production taxes are directly related to commodity price changes; however, severance taxes are based upon current year commodity prices, whereas ad valorem taxes are based upon prior year commodity prices. Severance taxes are paid on produced oil and natural gas based on a percentage of revenues from products sold at fixed rates established by federal, state or local taxing authorities. Where available, we benefit from tax credits and exemptions in our various taxing jurisdictions. In the counties where our production is located, we are also subject to ad valorem taxes, which are generally based on the taxing jurisdictions  valuation of our oil and gas properties.    

Production taxes for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016     in  creased by   35%   to   $3.5   million compared to   $2.6   million for the same period of   2015  . The   in  crease was primarily due to   a  n     in  crease in   severance taxes, which was attributable to the increase in revenue.  

25   

Callon Petroleum Company  

Table of Contents   

The increase was offset by a decrease in   ad valorem taxes   attributable to a lower valuation of our oil and gas properties by the taxing jurisdictions.   On a per BOE basis, production taxes for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased by   21%   compared to the same period of   2015  . 

Production taxes for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016     in  creased by   5%   to   $8.2   milli  on compared to   $7.8   million for the same period of   2015  . The   in  crease was primarily due to   an increase in severance taxes, which was attributable to the increase in revenue. The increase was offset by a   decrease in ad valorem taxes   attributable to a lower valuation of our oil and gas properties by the taxing jurisdictions.   On a per BOE basis, production taxes for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016     decreased   b  y    32%   co  mpared to the same period of   20  15.    

Depreciation, depletion and amortization ( DD A ).   Under the full cost accounting method, we capitalize costs within a cost center and then systematically   expense those costs on a units-of-production basis based on proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities. We calculate depletion on the following types of costs: (i) all capitalized costs, other than the cost of investments in unevaluated properties, less accumulated amortization; (ii) the estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing proved reserves; and (iii) the estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs, net of estimated salvage values. Depreciation of other property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to fifteen years. 

For   the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ,    D  D   A     in  creased     4%   to   $17.3   mil  lion   compared to   $16.7   million for the same period of   2015  . For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  ,    DD   A decreased   39%   per BOE to   $11.33   pe  r BOE compared to   $18.64   per BOE for the same period of   2015  .    The decrease is   attributable to our increased estimated proved reserves relative to our depreciable asset base   and assumed future development costs related to undeveloped proved reserves. The decrease in our depreciable base was primarily related to the write-down of oil and natural gas properties   during   the last half of   2015 and the first half   of 2016, offset by additions made through our horizontal drilling program and acquisitions. 

For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , DD   A decreased   6%   to   $49.3   mil  lion compared to   $52.4   million for the same period of   2015  . For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , D  D A decreased   39%   per BOE to   $12.70   per BO  E compared to   $20.68   per BOE for the same period of   2015  . The decrease is attributable to our increased estimated proved reserves relative to our depreciable asset base   and assumed future development costs related to undeveloped proved reserves. The decrease in our depreciable base was primarily related to the write-down of oil and natural gas properties during   the last half of   2015   and the first   half   of 2016, offset by additions made through our horizontal drilling program and acquisitions. 

General and administrative, net of amounts capitalized ( G A ).   These are costs incurred for overhead, including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff, severance and early retirement expenses, costs of maintaining our headquarters, costs of managing our production and development operations, franchise taxes, depreciation of corporate level assets, public company costs, vesting of equity and liability awards under share-based compensation plans and related mark-to-market valuation adjustments over time, fees for audit and other professional services, and legal compliance. 

G A for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016     in  creased to $  7.9   mi  llion compared to   $4.3   million for the same period of   2015  .   G A expenses for the periods indicated include the following (in millions):

G A for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased to   $19.8   mi  llion compared to   $22.2   million for the same period of   2015  .   G A expenses for the periods indicated include the following (in millions): 

Accretion expense.   The Company is required to record the estimated fair value of liabilities for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated ARO costs. Interest is accreted on the present value of the ARO and reported as accretion expense within operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. 

Accretion expense related to our   ARO   in  creased   32%     and   57%     f  or   the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,    respectively,   c  ompared to the same period  s   of   2015  . Accretion expense generally correlates with the Company s ARO  ,   which w  as   $5.5   mill  ion at   September 30, 2016     as compared to     $4.7   million at   September 30, 2015  . See   Note 9   in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company s ARO. 

Rig termination fee.   During the first quarter of 2015, the Company recognized $3.1 million in expense related to the early termination of the contract for its vertical rig. In March 2015, the Company decided to terminate its one-year contract for a vertical rig (effective April 2015). The Company paid approximately $3.1 million in reduced rental payments over the remainder of the lease term, which ended November 2015. 

Acquisition expense.   Acquisition expense for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   were related to costs with respect to our acquisition efforts in the Permian Basin. See Note 3 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company s acquisitions. 

Write-down of oil and natural gas properties.   Under full cost accounting rules, the Company reviews the carrying value of its proved oil and natural gas properties each quarter. Under these rules, capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization and deferred income taxes, may not exceed the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves, discounted at 10%, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unevaluated properties, net of related tax effects (the full cost ceiling amount).   These rules require pricing based on the preceding 12-months  average oil and natural gas prices based on closing prices on the first day of each month and require a write-down if the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties exceeds the full cost ceiling. 

For the     three months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company   did not   recognize   a    write-down of oil and natural gas properties   compared to   a write-down of     $87.3   million for the same period of   2015   as a result of the ceiling test limitation. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized a write-down of oil and natural gas properties of   $95.8   million   compared to a write-down of $87.3   million   for the same period of   2015     as a result of the ceiling test limitation. See Note   2   in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional inform  ation.   If commodity prices   were to   decline, we could incur additional ceiling test write-downs in the future.

Other Income and Expenses and Preferred Stock Dividends 

Interest expense  , net of capitalized amounts  .    We finance a portion of our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and acquisitions with borrowings under our Credit Facility or with term debt. We incur interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions. We reflect interest paid to our lender in interest expense, net of capitalized amounts. In addition, we include the amortization of deferred financing costs (including origination and amendment fees), commitment fees and annual agency fees in interest expense. 

Interest expense  , net of capitalized amounts,   incurre  d during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016     de  creased   $4.8   million compared to the same period of   2015  . The   de  crease is   primarily attributable to   a    $4.8   mi  llion increase in capitalized interest compared to the 2015 period, resulting from a higher average unevaluated property balance for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period of 2015.   The increase in unevaluated property was prima  rily due to acquired properties  .    

Interest expense  , net of capitalized amounts,   incurred during   the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016     de  creased   $5.1   million compared to the same period of   2015  . The   de  crease is primarily attributable to a   $5.2   million   in  crease in capitalized interest compared to the   2015   period, resulting from a   high  er average unevaluated property balance for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period of   2015  .    The increase in unevaluated property was primarily due to   acquired properties  .    Offsetting   the   de  crease was a   $0.1   million   in  crease in interest expense relate  d to our debt.

For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , the   net   gain   on   derivative contracts   was   $5.1   million   compared to a   $23.2   million net   gain   for the same period of   2015  . The net gain (loss) on derivative instruments for the periods indicated includes the following (in millions): 

For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the n  et loss on   derivative contract  s was   $11.2   mil  lion compared to a   $17.4   million net   gain   for the same period of   2015  .

Income tax   (benefit)   expense.   The Company had income tax   benefit     of $0.1 million   for the     three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   an   income tax   expense   of   $45.7   million   and   $38.5   million   for the same period  s   of   2015  . The change in income tax expense is primarily related to recording a valuation allowanc  e    of   $139.6    m  illion   at     September 30, 2016   and the difference in the amount of income (loss) before income taxes between periods. See Note 8 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information. 

Preferred Stock dividends.   Preferred Stock dividends for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016     wer  e    $1.8   million   and   $5.5   million, respectively,   as compared to   $2.0   million   and   $5.9   million   for the same period  s   of   2015  , respectively.   The decrease was due to a decrease in the number of preferred shares outstanding attributable to a partial share conversion in February   2016 in which   the Company exchanged a total of   120,000   shares of Preferred Stock for   719,000   shares of common stock.   Dividen  ds reflect a 10% dividend   yield  . See   Note 10     in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements   for additional informati  on.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   

We are exposed to a variety of market risks including commodity price risk, interest rate risk and counterparty and customer risk. We address these risks through a program of risk management including the use of derivative instruments. 

Commodity price risk 

The Company s revenues are derived from the sale of its oil and natural gas production. The prices for oil and natural gas remain extremely volatile and sometimes experience large fluctuations as a result of relatively small changes in supply, weather conditions, economic conditions and government actions. From time to time, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage oil and natural gas price risk, related both to NYMEX benchmark prices and regional basis differentials. The total volumes which we hedge through   use of our derivative instruments varies from period to period; however, generally our objective is to hedge approximately     50%    t  o    75%     of our anticipated internally forecast production for the next 12 to 24 months, subject to the covenants under our Credit Facility. Our hedge policies and objectives may change significantly with movements in commodities prices or futures prices, in addition to modification of our capital spending plans related to operational activities and acquisitions. 

The Company s hedging portfolio, linked to NYMEX benchmark pricing, covers approximat  el  y 6,000 barrels per day and 6,000 MMBtu per day o  f our expected oil and natura  l gas production  , respectively,   for the   remaining   three   months   of   2016  .     W  e    also   ha  ve   commodity hedging contracts linked to Midland WTI basis differentials relative to Cushing covering approximatel  y    4,000   barrels per day o  f our expected oil prod  uction for the   remaining   three   months   of 201  6  .    See   Note 6     in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements   for a description of the Company s outstanding derivative contracts at   September 30, 2016  ,    and derivative contracts established subsequent to that date. 

The Company may utilize fixed price swaps, which reduce the Company s exposure to decreases in commodity prices and limit the benefit the Company might otherwise have received from any increases in commodity prices. Swap contracts may also be enhanced by the simultaneous sale of call or put options to effectively increase the effective swap price as a result of the receipt of premiums from the option sales.  

The Company may utilize price collars to reduce the risk of changes in oil and natural gas prices. Under these arrangements, no payments are due by either party as long as the applicable market price is above the floor price (purchased put option) and below the ceiling price (sold call option) set in the collar. If the price falls below the floor, the counter-party to the collar pays the difference to the Company, and if the price rises above the ceiling, the counterparty receives the difference from the Company. Additionally, the Company may sell put (or call) options at a price lower than the floor price (or higher than the ceiling price) in conjunction with a collar (three-way collar) and use the proceeds to increase either or both the floor or ceiling prices.   In a three-way collar, to the extent that realized prices are below the floor price of the sold put option (or above the ceiling price of the sold call option), the Company s net realized benefit from the three-way collar will be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis. 

The Company may purchase put options, which reduce the Company s exposure to decreases in oil and natural gas prices while allowing realization of the full benefit from any increases in oil and natural gas prices. If the price falls below the floor, the counterparty pays the difference to the Company. 

The Company enters into these various agreements from time to time to reduce the effects of volatile oil and natural gas prices and does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Presently, none of the Company s derivative positions are designated as hedges for accounting purposes. 

Interest rate risk 

On   September 30, 2016  ,    the Company s debt consisted   of   $300   million   of outstanding principal   related to its   Term Loan   and   no     outstanding balance on our Credit Facility  .   The Company is subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on our indebtedness.   As of     September 30, 2016  , the interest rate on our   Term   Loan   borrowings was   8.50%  . An increase or decrease of   1%   in the interest rate would have a corresponding increase or decrease in our annual net income of approximately   $3.0   million based on the   $300   million outstanding in the aggregate under the   Term Loan on     September 30, 2016  .    The Company is also subject to market risk exposure related to changes in the underlying LIBOR-based interest rate used for the Term Loan to the extent that available LIBOR election options exceed the   1.0%   floor rate.     See   Note 5   to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Company s interest rates on debt.   Subsequent to period end, the Company repaid the outstanding balance of the Term Loan.

Counterparty and customer credit risk  

The Company s principal exposures to credit risk are through receivables from the sale of our oil and natural gas production, joint interest receivables and receivables resulting from derivative financial contracts. 

The Company markets its oil and natural gas production to energy marketing companies. We are subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers.     We do not require any of our customers to post collateral, and the inability of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results.   At   September 30, 2016   our   total   receivables from the sale of our oil and natural gas production were approxima  tely   $28.9   million. 

Joint interest receivables arise from billings to entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate. These entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we have or intend to drill. We have little ability to control whether these entities will participate in our wells. At   September 30, 2016   our joint interest receivables were approximately   $25.6   million. 

Our oil and natural gas derivative arrangements expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. Most of the counterparties on our derivative instruments currently in place   are lenders under our Credit Facility. We are likely to enter into additional derivative instruments with these or other lenders under our Credit Facility, representing institutions with an investment grade ratings. We have existing International Swap Dealers Association Master Agreements ( ISDA Agreements ) with our derivative counterparties. The terms of the ISDA Agreements provide us and the counterparties with rights of offset upon the occurrence of defined acts of default by either us or a counterparty to a derivative, whereby the party not in default may offset all derivative liabilities owed to the defaulting party against all derivative asset receivables from the defaulting party.    

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer performed an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officers have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 

Changes in internal control over financial reporting  .   There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during   the three months ended     September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonable likely to materially affect, our internal control over financ  ial reporting.
