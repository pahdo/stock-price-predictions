1.    Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation 

Mobivity Holdings Corp. (the  Company  or  we ) is in the business of developing and operating proprietary platforms over which brands and enterprises can conduct national and localized, data-driven mobile marketing campaigns.       Our proprietary platforms, consisting of software available to phones, tablets PCs, and Point of Sale (POS) systems, allow resellers, brands and enterprises to market their products and services to consumers through text messages sent directly to the consumers  via mobile phones, mobile smartphone applications, and dynamically printed receipt content.       We generate revenue by charging the resellers, brands and enterprises a per-message transactional fee, through fixed or variable software licensing fees, or via advertising fees. 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and disclosures required by GAAP for annual financial statements.       The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the   condensed   consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for   the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the SEC on   March 30, 2016  . 

In the opinion of management, such statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) which are considered necessary for a fair presentation of our condensed consolidated financial statements as of   September 30, 2016  , and for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . The results of operations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year ending December 31,   2016  .  

2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates used are those related to stock-based compensation, asset impairments, the valuation and useful lives of depreciable tangible and certain intangible assets, the fair value of common stock used in acquisitions of businesses, the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in acquisitions of businesses, and the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets. Management believes that these estimates are reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates. 

Restricted cash 

Restricted cash represent  s   funds   advanced   in accordance with the Company s   Working Capital Line of Credit Facility   which requires the Company to maintain collateral with a market value greater than or equal to the limit of liability. 

Accounts Receivable, Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Concentrations 

Accounts receivable are carried at their estimated collectible amounts. We grant unsecured credit to substantially all of our customers. Ongoing credit evaluations are performed and potential credit losses are charged to operations at the time the account receivable is estimated to be uncollectible. Since we cannot necessarily predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company recorded an   advance   of     $  160,579   against certain receivables under their Working   Capital Line of Credit Facility in accordance with the agreement.  

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of   $  158,915   and   $  237,383  , respectively.

Table of Contents  

Goodwill and Intangible Assets 

Goodwill is tested for impairment at a minimum on an annual basis. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative assessment, then the reporting unit's carrying value is compared to its fair value. The fair values of the reporting units are estimated using market and discounted cash flow approaches. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The discounted cash flow approach uses expected future operating results. Failure to achieve these expected results may cause a future impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit. 

Intangible assets consist of patents and trademarks, purchased customer contracts, purchased customer and merchant relationships, purchased trade names, purchased technology, non-compete agreements, and software development costs. Intangible assets are amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight-line method and estimated useful lives ranging from   one   to   twenty   years. No significant residual value is estimated for intangible assets. 

Software Development Costs 

Software development costs include direct costs incurred for internally developed products and payments made to independent software developers and/or contract engineers. The Company accounts for software development costs in accordance with the FASB guidance for the costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed ( ASC Subtopic 985-20 ). Software development costs are capitalized once the technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable. Technological feasibility of a product encompasses technical design documentation and integration documentation, or the completed and tested product design and working model. Software development costs are capitalized once technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable against future revenues. Technological feasibility is evaluated on a project-by-project basis. Amounts related to software development that are not capitalized are charged immediately to the appropriate expense account. Amounts that are considered  research and development  that are not capitalized are immediately charged to engineering, research, and development expense. 

Capitalized costs for those products that are cancelled or abandoned are charged to product development expense in the period of cancellation. Commencing upon product release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to  Amortization Expense -  Development  based on the straight-line method over a twenty-four month period. 

The Company evaluates the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs on an annual basis. For products that have been released in prior years, the primary evaluation criterion is ongoing relations with the customer.  

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

We evaluate long-lived assets (including intangible assets) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. An asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flow the asset is expected to generate. 

Foreign Currency Translation 

The Company translates the financial statements of its foreign subsidiary from the local (functional) currency into US Dollars using the year or reporting period end or average exchange rates in accordance with the requirements of Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 830-10,     Foreign Currency Matters     ( ASC 830-10 )  .     Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries were translated at exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates in effect for the periods presented. The cumulative translation adjustment is included in the accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) within shareholders  equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. 

Revenue Recognition and Concentrations 

Our SmartReceipt and C4 Mobile Marketing and customer relationship management are hosted solutions. We generate revenue from licensing our software to clients in our software as a service model, per-message and per-minute transactional fees, and customized professional services. We recognize license/subscription fees over the period of the contract, service fees as the services are performed, and per-message or per-minute transaction revenue when the transaction takes place. We recognize revenue at the time that the services are rendered, the selling price is fixed, and collection is reasonably assured, provided no significant obligations remain. We consider authoritative guidance on multiple deliverables in determining whether each deliverable represents a separate unit of accounting. Some customers are billed on a month to month basis with no contractual term and is collected by credit card. Revenue is recognized at the time that the services are rendered and the selling price is fixed with a set range of plans. Cash received in advance of the performance of services is recorded as deferred revenue.

We generate revenue from the Stampt App through customer agreements with business owners.  Revenue is principally derived from monthly subscription fees which provide a license for unlimited use of the Stampt App by the business owners and their customers.  The subscription fee is billed each month to the business owner.  Revenue is recognized monthly as the subscription revenues are billed.  There are no per-minute or transaction fees associated with the Stampt App. 

During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  ,    one   customer accounted for   50%   and   32%  , respectively, of our revenues. 

Comprehensive Income (Loss) 

Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. We are required to record all components of comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they are recognized. Net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss), including foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on investments, are reported, net of their related tax effect, to arrive at comprehensive income (loss). For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the comprehensive loss was   $1,576,907   and   $3,977,675  , respectively. For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  ,    the comprehensive loss was equal to the net loss. 

Net Loss Per Common Share 

Basic net loss per share excludes any dilutive effects of options, shares subject to repurchase and warrants. Diluted net loss per share includes the impact of potentially dilutive securities. During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , we had securities outstanding which could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future, but were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. 

Reclassifications 

Certain amounts from prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

Accounting standards promulgated by the FASB are subject to change. Changes in such standards may have an impact on the Company s future financial statements. The following are a summary of recent accounting developments. 

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . Under this guidance, an entity is required to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. This guidance offers specific accounting guidance for a lessee, a lessor and sale and leaseback transactions. Lessees and lessors are required to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about leasing arrangements to enable a user of the financial statements to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, and requires a modified retrospective adoption, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . The standard is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including the income tax impact, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. The Company elected to early adopt the new guidance in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 which requires us to reflect any adjustments as of January 1, 2016, the beginning of the annual period that includes the interim period of adoption. The primary impact of adoption was the recognition of additional stock compensation expense and paid-in capital for all periods in fiscal year 2016. Additional amendments to the recognition of excess tax benefits, accounting for income taxes and minimum statutory withholding tax requirements had no impact to retained earnings as of January 1, 2016, where the cumulative effect of these changes are required to be recorded. We have elected to account for forfeitures as they occur to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period. 

-    7    - 

Table of Contents  

Adoption of the new standard impacted our previously reported quarterly results for the fiscal year 2016 as follows: 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05 regarding Subtopic 350-40,  Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software.  The amendments in ASU 2015-05 provide guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. The amendments in ASU 2015-05 are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in ASU 2015-05 may be applied either prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date or retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 regarding ASC Topic 606,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  ASU 2014-09 provides principles for recognizing revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 to defer the effective date by one year with early adoption permitted as of the original effective date. ASU 2014-09 will be effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018 unless we elect the earlier date of January 1, 2017. In addition, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, and ASU 2016-12 in March 2016, April 2016, and May 2016, respectively, to help provide interpretive clarifications on the new guidance in ASC Topic 606. The Company is currently evaluating the accounting, transition, and disclosure requirements of the standard and cannot currently estimate the financial statement impact of adoptio  n. 

3.  Acquisitions 

LiveLenz Acquisition 

On January 15, 2016, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of LiveLenz Inc., a Nova Scotia corporation ( LiveLenz ), pursuant to an agreement dated January 15, 2016 among the Company and the stockholders of LiveLenz. Pursuant to the agreement, we acquired all of the capital stock of LiveLenz in consideration of our issuance of   1,000,000   shares ( Consideration Shares ) of our common stock to the LiveLenz stockholders  ,   our issuance of an additional   15,000   share of our common stock in satisfaction of certain liabilities of LiveLenz  , and the assumption of their existing liabilities  . The agreement included customary representations, warranties, and covenants by us and the LiveLenz stockholders, including the LiveLenz stockholders  agreement to indemnify us against certain claims or losses resulting from certain breaches of representations, warranties or covenants by the LiveLenz stockholders in the agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, the LiveLenz stockholders have agreed to adjust the number of Consideration Shares downward based on LiveLenz  working capital as of the closing and in the event of any claims for indemnification by us. The LiveLenz stockholders have agreed that   100%   of the Consideration Shares will be escrowed for a period of   18   months and subject to forfeiture based on indemnification claims by us or the final determination of LiveLenz  working capital as of the closing date.

BDC Term Loan 

On January 8, 2016, Livelenz (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company,) entered into an amendment of their original loan agreement dated August 26, 2011 with the Business Development Bank of Canada ( BDC ). Under this agreement the loan will mature, and the commitments will terminate on December 15, 2017.  

ACOA Note

SVB Working Capital Line of Credit Facility 

In March 2016, we entered into a Working Capital Line of Credit Facility (the  Facility ) with Silicon Valley Bank ( SVB ) to provide up to   $2   million to finance our general working capital needs. The Facility is funded based on cash on deposit balances and advances against our accounts receivable based on customer invoicing. Interest on Facility borrowings is calculated at rates between the prime rate minus   1.75%   and prime rate plus   3.75%   based on the borrowing base formula used at the time of borrowing. The Facility contains standard events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of representations, breaches of affirmative or negative covenants, and bankruptcy.   During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company borrowed   $1,000,000  , under this facility. 

Under the terms of the Fac  i  l  i  ty, the Company is obligated to pay a commitment fee on the available unused amount of the Facility commitments equal to   0.5%   per annum.

Valuation Assumptions 

The fair value of each stock option award was calculated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following weighted average assumptions were used for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 

The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon published interest rates appropriate for the expected life of our employee stock options. 

The expected life of the stock options represents the weighted-average period that the stock options are expected to remain outstanding and was determined based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock-based awards, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior as influenced by changes to the terms of its stock-based awards. 

The dividend yield assumption is based on our history of not paying dividends and no future expectations of dividend payouts. 

The expected volatility in 2016 and 2015 is based on the historical publicly traded price of our common stock.  

Restricted stock units 

The following table summarizes restricted stock unit activity under our stock-based plans for the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  :

8  .  Fair Value Measurements 

Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the authoritative guidance establishes a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level 1) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level 2) inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which requires us to develop our own assumptions. This hierarchy requires companies to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. On a recurring basis, we measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. 

The following table presents assets that are measured and recognized at fair value as of   September 30, 2016   on a recurring and non-recurring basis:

Overview 

We are in the business of developing and operating proprietary platforms over which resellers, brands and enterprises can conduct localized mobile marketing campaigns. Our proprietary platforms allow resellers, brands and enterprises to market their products and services to consumers through text messages sent directly to the consumers  mobile phones, content on printed receipts, mobile device applications, which consists of software available to both phones and tablet PCs. We generate revenue by charging the brands and enterprises a per-message transactional fee, or through fixed or variable software licensing fees. Our customers include national franchisers, professional sports teams and associations and other national brands such as Sonic, Subway, Jamba Juice, Chick-Fil-A, Baskin Robbins, and others. 

Mobile phone users represent a large and captive audience. While televisions, radios, and even PCs are often shared by multiple consumers, mobile phones are personal devices representing a unique and individual address to the end user. We believe that the future of digital media will be significantly influenced by mobile phones where a direct, personal conversation can be had with the world s largest target audience. According to a report published by International Data Corporation (IDC), by 2015, more U.S. Internet users will access the Internet through mobile devices than through PCs or other wireline devices (Worldwide New Media Market Model 1H-2012 Highlights: Internet Becomes Ever More Mobile, Ever Less PC-Based (IDC #237459)). The IDC study further reports that the number of people accessing the Internet, in the U.S., through PCs will shrink from 240 million consumers in 2012 to 225 million in 2016. At the same time, the number of mobile users will increase from 174 million to 265 million. We believe the future of mobile applications and services includes banking, commerce, advertising, video, games and just about every other aspect of both on and offline life. 

Our unique approach to personalized, targeted offline marketing is marketed through our  SmartSuite  portfolio of solutions that all leverage our proprietary path to point-of-sale data. Our primary SmartSuite product is  SmartSMS  which utilizes SMS text messaging as a communications channel for targeted awareness and offers messages to consumers, leveraging purchase data to measure and target those messages much in the same way an e-commerce operator, like Amazon, uses online shopping cart data. For

example, a consumer might receive a text message near lunch time offering a special discount to purchase a six-inch sub at their nearest Subway location. Once the consumer shows that text message at check out, our SmartReceipt technology kicks in to match that customer s purchase with their offer redemption, thereby providing the ability to assess the effectiveness of the SMS offer.  It also builds a purchase history of that customer for more targeted offers in the future.  

In addition to SmartSMS, our SmartReceipt solution is capable of controlling the printed receipt to print targeted, graphical messages, including offers and coupons, on the front of the receipt consumer s receive following a purchase. With SmartRecept, we can also transform the underutilized, printed receipt into a targeted messaging opportunity. As an example, say a consumer purchases a sandwich but doesn t purchase a beverage. SmartReceipt sees the customer s purchase information in real-time   and as the receipt is being printed, it can automatically see that the consumer didn t buy a beverage and dynamically, in real time, add a strong beverage coupon to the printed receipt in an effort to influence that consumer to add a beverage on their next visit.  

Our SmartSuite portfolio of solutions is rounded out with  SmartAnalytics,  which provides a set of reporting and analytics tools enabling brands to better understand their sales data across what could be a disparate collection of various point-of-sale devices.  

Our goal is to expand our solution offerings to include applications that will leverage offline purchase data to provide attribution and better power mobile and online ad networks, shape marketing from real-time inventory and sales data, and apply emerging machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies to the massive purchase data sets we re accumulating to drive predictive and automated solutions. 

Recent Events 

2016 Warrant Exercise 

Between September 29 and October 31, 2016, we conducted an offer to the holders of our outstanding common stock purchase warrants pursuant to which our warrant holders were permitted to exercise their warrants at a reduced exercise price for a period expiring on October 31, 2016. At the commencement of the warrant offer, there were warrants outstanding that entitled their holders to purchase 8,551,168 shares of our common stock at exercise prices   of $1.00 and   $1.20   per share. The holders of all warrants were allowed to conduct cash-based exercises of their warrants at an exercise price of   $0.70   per share up through October 31, 2016. We undertook   this limited-time warrant exercise price reduction in order to raise additional capital without incurring further potential dilution to our stockholders. In addition, through the warrant holders  acceptance of our offer, we could significantly reduce the number of outstanding warrants and thereby simplify our capital structure.   As of the close of the warrant offer, there have been   3,329,990   warrants exercised to purchase   3,329,990   shares of our common stock, resulting in additional capital of   $2,330,993  .

Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities

The change in fair value of derivative liabilities for the     nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   nine months ended September 30, 2015    w  as a   decrease   of   $34,980  . 

The value of the derivative liabilities at any given date is based primarily on the value and volatility of our common stock, among other less significant factors. In periods when our stock price or volatility rises, we expect to record a loss in the change in fair value of the derivative liabilities.       The conversion of convertible notes payable into common shares in June 2013, reducing the number of warrants subject to derivative liability treatment, significantly reduced our ongoing exposure to derivative liability valuation adjustments.   All warrants which included embedded derivative liabilities expired as of December 31, 2015, which was the primary cause of the gain during 2015.

Gain on Adjustment in Contingent Consideration 

The   gain on   adjustment in contingent consideration   decreased   $87,740   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  .    

The gain on adjustment in contingent consideration decreased $89,740 during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .   

The gains relate  d   to a decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration resulting from re-measurement of the SmartReceipt and Stampt earn-out liabilities  .   These earnouts were settled during   2015  . 

Foreign Currency 

The Company s financial results are impacted by volatility in the Canadian/U.S.   D  ollar e  xchange rate. The average U.S. D  ol  lar exchange rate for   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was $1 Canadian equals $0.7  7   and $0.76   U.S.     D  ollar  s, respectively  .   This compares to an average   rate of $1 Canadian equals $0.  77 and $0.79   U.S.   Dollar     during   the same period  s   of   2015  The Company s functional or measurement currency is   the   U.S.   Dollar. Based on a U.S. D  ollar functional currency, the following are the key areas impacted by foreign currency volatility:  

The Company sells products primarily in U.S.   D  ollars; therefore, reported revenues are not highly impacted by foreign currency volatility.      

A portion of the Company s expenses are incurred in Canadian   D  ollars and therefore fluctuate in U.S.   D  ollar  s as the U.S. Dollar varies. A weaker U.S. D  ollar results in an increase in translated   expenses, and a stronger U.S. D  ollar results in a decrease.      

Changes in foreign currency rates also impact the translated value of the Company s working capital that i  s held in Canadian D  ollars. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations result in foreign exchange gains or losses based upon movement in the translated value of Cana  dian working capital into U.S. D  ollars.      

The   change in   foreign   currency were     gain  s     of $372     and $1,488   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of   September 30, 2016  , we had current assets of   $2,158,284  , including   $273,539   in cash,   $1,000,000   in restricted cash   and   current liabilities of   $2,830,295  , resulting in    a     working   deficit     of   $(672,011)  .   

Since September 30, 2016, o  ur working capital has increased as a result of our gross receipts   of $2,330,993   from our warrant exercises. We believe a  s of the date of this report, we have working capital on hand to fund our current level of operations   at least through the end of the   next fiscal   year  .       However, there can be no assurance that we will not require additional capital  .      If we require additional capital, we will seek to obtain additional working capital through the sale of our securities and, if av  ailable, bank lines of credit.    However, there can be no assurance we will be able to obtain access to capital as and when needed and, if so, the terms of any available financing may not be subject to commercially reasonable terms.

(a)    That the undersigned:  

(i)         alone or with the assistance of the undersigned s own professional advisor who is unaffiliated with and who is not compensated by the Company or any of its affiliates (   Purchaser Representative   ), has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that the undersigned is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Warrant Shares, has the capacity to protect the undersigned s own interests in connection with an investment in the Warrant Shares and has the net worth to undertake such risks such that the undersigned could be reasonably assumed to have the capacity to protect his or her own interests in connection with a purchase of the Warrant Shares (if the undersigned has employed a Purchaser Representative in connection with an evaluation of a purchase of the Warrant Shares, the undersigned has set forth below the name, address and occupation of the Purchaser Representative): 

and; 

(ii)    is an individual who has a pre   existing personal or business relationship with the Company or any of its officers, directors or controlling persons or selling broker, as described below: 

(b)    That the undersigned had the opportunity to review this Warrant Exercise Agreement, the Company s Warrant Offer Letter dated September 28, 2016 and the Company s reports and registration statements on file with the SEC, including: 

The Company s prospectus dated August 8, 2016 filed with the SEC on August 10, 2016 (the undersigned acknowledges that the prospectus does not relate to the present offering and sale of the Warrant Shares and is referred herein because the prospectus provides the most recent comprehensive disclosure concerning the Company);      

-    2    -

All other reports filed with the SEC subsequent to August 15, 2016 (the aforementioned are collectively referred to as the    Disclosure Package   ).     

The undersigned acknowledges that it has otherwise been given full and complete access to information regarding the Company and has utilized such access to the undersigned s satisfaction for the purpose of obtaining such information regarding the Company as the undersigned has reasonably requested; and, particularly, the undersigned has been given reasonable opportunity to ask questions of, and receive answers from, representatives of the Company concerning the terms and conditions of the offering of the Warrant Shares and to obtain any additional information, to the extent reasonably available; 

(c)    That the undersigned recognizes that the Warrant Shares as an investment involves a high degree of risk, including, but not limited to, those risks set forth in the  Risk Factors  section of the Company s prospectus dated August 8, 2016;
