FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 NINE MONTHS ENDED

Note 1 - Basis of presentation, organization
and other matters  

Headquartered in
Melville, N.Y., Data Storage Corporation ( DSC  or the  Company ) offers its cloud based disaster recovery
and business continuity solutions and services to businesses within the healthcare, banking and finance, distribution services,
manufacturing, construction, education and government sectors. 

DSC derives revenues from long term subscription
services and professional services related to the implementation of subscription services that provide organizations in the education,
government and healthcare industries protection of critical computerized data. In 2009, the Company s revenues consisted
primarily of offsite data backup, de-duplication, continuous data protection and Cloud Disaster Recovery solutions and protecting
information for our clients. In 2010, DSC expanded its solutions based on the asset acquisition of SafeData to provide business
continuity solution to the IBM user marketplace. In 2012, DSC continued to assimilate and acquire organizations, expanded its technology
as well as its technical group and positioned the new organization for growth. In October 2012, DSC purchased the software and
assets of Message Logic. The Message Logic acquisition provides DSC with ownership of the pending patent and intellectual property
to insure email compliance to organizations within its client base and target audience. In 2012 DSC entered into a joint venture
agreement with ABC Services LLC to provide an IBM Power i cloud with 50% ownership in the entity Secure Infrastructure and Services,
LLC. 

DSC maintains equipment for cloud storage
and cloud computing in our data centers in Massachusetts, and New York. DSC delivers its solutions over highly reliable, redundant
and secure fiber optic networks with separate and diverse routes to the Internet. DSC s network and geographical diversity
is important to clients seeking storage hosting and disaster recovery solutions, ensuring protection of data and continuity of
business in the case of a network interruption. 

Liquidity  

The financial statements have been prepared
using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable for a going concern, which assumes that
the Company will realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the ordinary course of business. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company has generated revenues of $2,912,152 but has incurred a net loss attributable to common shareholders
of $587,861. Its ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon achieving sales growth, reduction of operation expenses
and ability of the Company to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and pay its liabilities arising from normal
business operations when they come due, and upon profitable operations. The Company has been funded by the Mr. Charles M. Piluso,
the Company s Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and largest shareholder since inception as well as several Directors.
It is the intention of Mr. Piluso to continue to fund the Company on an as-needed basis. 

The condensed balance sheet at December 31, 2015 was derived
from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. The other information in these condensed financial statements is unaudited but, in the opinion of
management, reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods covered. All such adjustments
are of a normal recurring nature unless disclosed otherwise. These condensed financial statements, including notes, have been prepared
in accordance with the applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and do not include all of the information and
disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements.
These condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and additional information as
contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies 

Stock Based Compensation  

The Company follows the
requirements of FASB ASC 718-10-10,  Share-Based Payments  with regard to stock-based compensation issued to employees. The
Company has stock-based incentives for consultants and employees that over achieve. This plan is discretionary. The expense for
this stock-based compensation is equal to the fair value of the stock that was determined by using closing price on the day the
stock was awarded multiplied by the number of shares awarded. The Company records its options at fair value using the Black-Scholes
valuation model. 

Recently Issued and Newly Adopted Accounting
Pronouncements  

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ( ASU 2014-09 ), which requires entities to recognize revenue in
a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which
the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance also requires additional disclosure
about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant
judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. In July 2015, the
FASB voted to delay the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year to the first quarter of 2018 to provide companies sufficient
time to implement the standards. Early adoption will be permitted, but not before the first quarter of 2017. Adoption can occur
using one of two prescribed transition methods. In March and April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts
with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  and ASU 2016-10,  Revenue
from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  which provide supplemental adoption guidance
and clarification to ASC 2014-09. ASU 2016-08 and ASU 2016-10 must be adopted concurrently with the adoption of ASU 2014-09. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact of these new standards. 

On August 2014, FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concerns (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosures of Uncertainties
about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The amendments require management to assess an entity s ability
to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards.
Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt, (2) require an evaluation every reporting
period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management s plans, (4)
require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management s plans, (5)
require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for
a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The amendments in this
Update are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter.
Early application is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position
or results of operations. 

In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued ASU 2015-05,  Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement.  This
ASU provides clarification on whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a software license is included,
the customer should account for the license consistent with its accounting of other software licenses. If a software license is
not included, the arrangement should be accounted for as a service contract. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those years. Adoption of ASU 2015-05 did not have a material impact
on our financial position or results of operations. 

During February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-02,  Leases  ( ASU 2016-02 ). The standard requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a lease
asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months on its balance sheet. The update also expands
the required quantitative and qualitative disclosures surrounding leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new
standard. 

In March 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,
 Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several
aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions for both public and nonpublic entities, including the accounting
for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows.
ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the standard and the impact on its consolidated
financial statements and footnote disclosures. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,
 Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU
2016-15 addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing diversity in practice regarding how certain cash
receipts and cash payments are presented in the statement of cash flows. The standard provides guidance on the classification of
the following items: (1) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, (2) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, (3) contingent
consideration payments made after a business combination, (4) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, (5) proceeds from
the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, (6) distributions received from equity method investments, (7) beneficial
interests in securitization transactions, and (8) separately identifiable cash flows. The Company is required to adopt ASU 2016-15
for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017 on a retrospective basis.
Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption
of ASU 2016-15. 

We have reviewed all FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update ( ASU ) accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effectiveness dates during
the periods reported and in future periods. The Company has carefully considered the new pronouncements that alter previous generally
accepted accounting principles and does not believe that any new or modified principles will have a material impact on the corporation s
reported financial position or operations in the near term. The applicability of any standard is subject to the formal review of
our financial management and certain standards are under consideration. 

Management does not believe there would have
been a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements had any other recently issued, but not yet effective,
accounting standards been adopted in the current period. 

Principles of Consolidation  

The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary, Data Storage Corporation, a Delaware Corporation. All significant inter-company
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Equity Investments  

Equity investments in which the Company exercises
significant influence but does not control and is not the primary beneficiary are accounted for using the equity method. The Company s
share of its equity method investee s earnings or losses is included in other income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements
of Operations. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these
estimates. 

Estimated Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

The Company's financial instruments include
cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, line of credit and due to related parties. Management believes the estimated fair
value of these accounts at September 30, 2016 approximate their carrying value as reflected in the balance sheets due to the short-term
nature of these instruments or the use of market interest rates for debt instruments. The carrying values of certain of the Company s
notes payable and capital lease obligations approximate their fair values based upon a comparison of the interest rate and terms
of such debt given the level of risk to the rates and terms of similar debt currently available to the Company in the marketplace. 

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments  

The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with an original maturity or remaining maturity at the time of purchase, of six months or less to be cash equivalents. 

Concentration of Credit Risk and Other Risks
and Uncertainties  

Financial instruments and assets subjecting
the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, short- term investments and trade accounts
receivable. The Company's cash and cash equivalents are maintained at major U.S. financial institutions. Deposits in these institutions
may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. 

The Company's customers are primarily concentrated
in the United States. 

The Company provides credit in the normal course
of business. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances for doubtful accounts on
factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and other information. 

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 DSC had one customer representing 19% of sales. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, DSC had no customer concentrations.  

Accounts Receivable/Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts  

The Company sells its services to customers
on an open credit basis. Accounts receivable are uncollateralized, non-interest-bearing customer obligations. Accounts receivables
are due within 30 days. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the estimated accounts receivable that will not be collected
due to credit losses and allowances. Provisions for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable are made for individual accounts
based upon specific facts and circumstances including criteria such as their age, amount, and customer standing. Provisions are
also made for other accounts receivable not specifically reviewed based upon historical experience. Clients are invoiced in advance
for services as reflected in deferred revenue on the Company s balance sheet. 

Property and Equipment  

Property and equipment
is recorded at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives or the term of the lease using the straight-line method for
financial statement purposes. Estimated useful lives in years for depreciation are five to seven years for property and equipment.
Additions, betterments and replacements are capitalized, while expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to operations
when incurred. As units of property are sold or retired, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts,
and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in income. 

Income Taxes  

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date. At September 30, 2016, the Company had a full valuation allowance against
its deferred tax assets. 

Goodwill and Other Intangibles  

In accordance with GAAP, the Company tests
goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis. Goodwill impairment exists if the net book value
of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. The impairment testing is performed in two steps: 

 (i) the Company determines impairment by comparing
the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, and (ii) if there is an impairment, the Company measures the amount
of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. To determine the
fair value of these intangible assets, the Company uses many assumptions and estimates using a market participant approach that
directly impact the results of the testing. In making these assumptions and estimates, the Company uses industry accepted valuation
models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management. 

In September 2011, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2011-08,  Intangibles-Goodwill
and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment , to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test goodwill
for impairment. ASU 2011-08 permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely
than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, it
is necessary to perform the currently prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test. Otherwise, the two-step goodwill impairment
test is not required. The Company adopted ASU 2011-08 in fiscal 2013 and thus performed a qualitative assessment. This adoption
did not have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Revenue Recognition  

The Company s revenues
consist principally of cloud storage and cloud computing revenues, SaaS and IaaS. Storage revenues consist of monthly charges related
to the storage of materials or data (generally on a per unit basis). Sales are generally recorded in the month the service is provided.
For customers who are billed on an annual basis, deferred revenue is recorded and amortized over the life of the contract. Set
up fees charged in connection with storage contracts are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the
contract. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  

In accordance with FASB
ASC 360-10-35, we review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value
of an asset might not be recoverable. An impairment loss, measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value,
is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds estimated undiscounted future cash flows. 

Advertising Costs  

The Company expenses the costs associated with
advertising as they are incurred. The Company incurred $106,865 and $27,325 for advertising costs for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share  

In accordance with FASB ASC 260, Earnings Per
Share, basic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common
stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) adjusted for income or
loss that would result from the assumed conversion of potential common shares from contracts that may be settled in stock or cash
by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities outstanding
during each period. The inclusion of the potential common shares to be issued would have an anti-dilutive effect on diluted loss
per share and therefore they are not included in the calculation. Potentially dilutive securities at September 30, 2016 include
7,045,463 options and 133,334 warrants. 

Note 3 - Property and Equipment  

Property and equipment, at cost, consist of the following :  

Depreciation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 was $134,095 and $321,278, respectively. 

Note 4 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets 

Goodwill and intangible assets consisted of the following :  

Scheduled amortization over the next two years as follows: 

Amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 was $22,976 and $91,185 respectively. 

Note 5   Investment in At Equity 

The Company has a 50% non-controlling ownership
interest in Secure Infrastructure   Services, LLC who provides infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) for IBM iSeries and AIX
v7 systems, Power HA services and network infrastructure hardware and services as needed to support the IaaS and PowerHA implementation
and ongoing needs for customers and services sold under the Company. ASC 810 requires the Company to evaluate non-consolidated
entities periodically and as circumstances change to determine if an implied controlling interest exists. During Fiscal 2013, the
Company evaluated this equity investment and concluded that this is a variable interest entity and the Company is not the primary
beneficiary. Secure Infrastructure   Services, LLC's fiscal year end is December 31. 

The following presents unaudited summary financial
information for Secure Infrastructure   Services, LLC. Such summary financial information has been provided herein based upon
the individual significance of this unconsolidated equity investment to the consolidated financial information of the Company. 

The equity balance carried on the Company's balance sheet amounts
to $17,545 as of September 30, 2016. 

The Company's share of the net loss from Secure
Infrastructure   Services, LLC for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $2,572. 

Note 6   Capital Lease Obligations

2008 Equity Incentive Plan 

In October 2008, the Company s board
of directors (the  Board ) adopted, the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2008 Plan ). Under the 2008 Plan,
we may grant options (including incentive stock options) to purchase our common stock or restricted stock awards to our employees,
consultants or non-employee directors. The 2008 Plan is administered by the Board. Awards may be granted pursuant to the 2008 Plan
for 10 years from the date the Board approved the 2008 Plan. Any grant under the 2008 Plan may be repriced, replaced or regranted
at the discretion of the Board. From time to time, we may issue awards pursuant to the 2008 Plan. 

The material terms of options granted under
the 2008 Plan (all of which have been nonqualified stock options) are consistent with the terms described in the footnotes to the
 Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End December 31, 2011 , including five-year graded vesting schedules and exercise
prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock grants made under the 2008 Plan have not
been subject to vesting requirements. The 2008 Plan was terminated with respect to the issuance of new awards as of February 3,
2012. There are 2,081,090 options outstanding under this plan as of September 30, 2016. 

2010 Incentive Award Plan 

The Company has reserved 2,000,000 shares of
common stock for issuance under the terms of the Data Storage Corporation 2010 Incentive Award Plan (the  2010 Plan ).
The 2010 Plan is intended to promote the interests of the Company by attracting and retaining exceptional employees, consultants,
directors, officers and independent contractors (collectively referred to as the  Participants ), and enabling such
Participants to participate in the long-term growth and financial success of the Company. Under the 2010 Plan, the Company may
grant stock options, which are intended to qualify as  incentive stock options  under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, non- qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock awards, which are restricted
shares of common stock (collectively referred to as  Incentive Awards ). Incentive Awards may be granted pursuant to
the 2010 Plan for 10 years from the Effective Date. From time to time, we may issue Incentive Awards pursuant to the 2010 Plan.
Each of the awards will be evidenced by and issued under a written agreement. 

On April 23, 2012, the Board of Directors of
the Company amended and restated the Data Storage Corporation 2010 Plan. The 2010 Plan, as amended and restated, has been renamed
the  Amended and Restated Data Storage Corporation Incentive Award Plan . The new plan provides for flexibility in
vesting periods and includes a limit of $100,000 per employee per year for incentive stock options 

There are 4,714,373 options
outstanding under this plan as of September 30, 2016. There were 36,627 shares available for future grants under the plans. 

A summary of the Company's option activity and related information
follows: 

Share-based compensation expense for options
totaling $36,420 and $73,833 was recognized in our results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively
and is based on awards vested. 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company granted 250,000 options to an employee (valued on the grant date at $0.04 using the Black
Scholes pricing model). 

The following weighted-average assumptions
were used for grants made under the stock option plans for the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

The valuation methodology used to determine
the fair value of the options issued during the year was the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes model requires
the use of a number of assumptions including volatility of the stock price, the average risk-free interest rate, and the weighted
average expected life of the options. 

The risk-free interest rate assumption is based
upon observed interest rates on zero coupon U.S. Treasury bonds whose maturity period is appropriate for the term of the Warrants
and is calculated by using the average daily historical stock prices through the day preceding the grant date. 

Estimated volatility is a measure of the amount
by which the Company s stock price is expected to fluctuate each year during the expected life of the award. The Company s
estimated volatility is an average of the historical volatility of peer entities whose stock prices were publicly available. The
Company s calculation of estimated volatility is based on historical stock prices of these peer entities over a period equal
to the expected life of the awards. The Company uses the historical volatility of peer entities due to the lack of sufficient historical
data of its stock price. 

As of September 30, 2016,
there was $24,550 of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested employee options granted under the Company s
share based compensation plans that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.25 years.

certain assets from ABC, including tangible assets and service agreements, in consideration of an aggregate 64,669,936 shares of
common stock of the Company (the  Shares ). The closing occurred on October 25, 2016. In the event that the audits of
ABC I or ABC II for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 provide that either ABC I or ABC II have generated less than $2,000,000
in revenue, then such entity's respective Shares will be reduced by the proportionate amount of such shortfall.

the Company to the Affiliates into shares of common stock of the Company at a conversion price of $0.10 per share (the  Conversion
Price ) resulting in the issuance of an aggregate of 26,781,242 shares of common stock of the Company to the Affiliates. Specifically,
the Company and Charles Piluso converted $1,802,521.08 into 18,025,210, the Company, John Coghlan converted $138,822 into 1,388,220
shares of common stock of the Company and the Company and Clifford Stein converted $736,781.20 into 7,367,812 shares of common
stock of the Company. At the end of the 90 day period following the Effective Date, if the average closing price during any ten
(10) day period during the 90 day period is greater than $0.10 per share (the  Adjusted Conversion Price ), then the
Conversion Price will be adjusted to equal the Adjusted Conversion Price; provided, however, that the Adjusted Conversion Price
will have a ceiling of $0.20 per share, whereby if the 10 day average closing price is greater than $0.20 per share during the
90 day period, then the Conversion Price will be adjusted to equal $0.20 per share. There will only be one adjustment.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

The financial statements have been prepared
using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable for a going concern, which assumes that
the Company will realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The Company has been funded
by the CEO and largest shareholder combined with private placements of the Company s stock. The Company has been successful
in raising money as needed. Further it is the intention of management to continue to raise money through stock issuances and to
fund the Company on an as needed basis. During 2016, we intend to continue to work to increase our presence in the IBM marketplace
utilizing our increased technical expertise, capacity for data storage and managed services and expand our presence in the email
archiving marketplace through our acquisition of Message Logic. 

To the extent we are successful in growing
our business, identifying potential acquisition targets and negotiating the terms of such acquisition, and the purchase price includes
a cash component, we plan to use our working capital and the proceeds of any financing to finance such acquisition costs. Our opinion
concerning our liquidity is based on current information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, or if circumstances change,
we may not be able to meet our liquidity needs. 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016 the Company s cash increased $38,426 to $105,471, from $67,045 at December 31, 2015. Net cash of $208,577 was provided

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk 

Interest Rate Sensitivity 

Interest due on the Company s loans
is based upon the applicable stated fixed contractual rate with the lender. Interest earned on DSC bank accounts is linked to the
applicable base interest rate. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, DSC had interest expense, net of interest
income, of $204,466 and $218,828, respectively. DSC believes that its results of operations are not materially affected by changes
in interest rates. 

DSC s exposure to market risk is confined
to its cash and cash equivalents, all of which have maturities of less than three months and bear and pay interest in U.S. dollars.
Since DSC invests in highly liquid, relatively low yield investments, we do not believe interest rate changes would have a material
impact on us. 

DSC does not hold any derivative instruments
and does not engage in any hedging activities.

As of the end of the period covered by this
Report, under the supervision and with the participation of DSC s management, including its principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, DSC conducted an evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under
Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ).
Based on this evaluation, DSC s principal executive officer and principal financial officers have concluded that DSC s
disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by DSC in the reports
it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in
the Securities and Exchange Commission s (the  SEC ) rules based on the material weakness described below. 

The material weaknesses identified during management s
assessment were (i) a lack of sufficient internal accounting expertise to provide reasonable assurance that our financial statements
and notes thereto are prepared in accordance with GAAP and (ii) a lack of segregation of duties to ensure adequate review of financial
statement preparation. In light of these material weaknesses, management has concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, DSC did
not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. As defined by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing
Standard No. 5, a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies, such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. In order to ensure
the effectiveness of DSC s disclosure controls in the future DSC intends on adding financial staff resources to our accounting
and finance department. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective
can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting .  

There have been no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
