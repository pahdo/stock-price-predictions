1   Nature of Operations   

Nature
of Operations   

STL
Marketing Group, Inc., (the  Company ) has several business operations. The Company s initial focus, renewable
energy, is currently on hold due to political delays in this industry in Costa Rica. The Company has pivoted to technology, a
core competency of its senior management team. The Company has sales and marketing operations in: (1) PhoneSuite Solutions, an
IP PBX product for the hospitality industry and (2) F3TCH, a patent pending technology, that virtualizes the hotel guest room
telephone to a guest s smart phone or device.  

STL
Marketing Group, Inc. (the  Company,   our Company,   we,   us,   our, 
or  STL, ) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on February 16, 1999 under the original name of
Fountain Colony Ventures, Inc. Fountain Colony Ventures, Inc. changed its name to SGT Ventures, Inc. in March 2006. In June 2006,
SGT Ventures, Inc. changed its name to Stronghold Industries, Inc. On October 30, 2007, Stronghold Industries, Inc. entered into
a share purchase and exchange agreement with Image Worldwide, Inc. The Company name was officially changed with the Secretary
of State to Image Worldwide, Inc. ( Image Worldwide ) on November 21, 2007. Image Worldwide entered into a share exchange
agreement with St. Louis Packaging Inc. and Image Worldwide Marketing, Inc., a Delaware corporation, on January 31, 2009. On November
27, 2009 the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell all of its assets to Invicta Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation.
In April 2009, the Company changed its name to STL Marketing Group, Inc. On October 15, 2012, the Company transferred ownership
to Versant I, Inc., a Panamanian company owned by the current CEO. On February 4, 2013 the Company entered into a share exchange
and merged with Versant Corporation, a Delaware company whereby Versant became the Company s wholly owned operating subsidiary.
The transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger.  

Going
Concern   

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a net loss of $430,257
and used cash in operations of $117,881, and at September 30, 2016, had a stockholders  deficit of $6,438,513 and a working
capital deficiency of $6,457,602. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. In addition, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on the Company s
December 31, 2015 financial statements, has raised substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to raise additional
funds and implement its business plan. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the
Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had cash on hand in the amount of $1,262. Management estimates that the current funds on hand
will not be sufficient to continue operations. We expect to be able to secure capital advances from our officers or principal
shareholders in order to pay our operating expenses. In addition, management is seeking additional funds, primarily through the
issuance of debt and equity securities for cash to operate our business, and estimates that a significant amount of capital will
be necessary to advance the development of our projects to the point at which they will become commercially viable.  

No
assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory
to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations,
in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in case of equity financing. The ability of
the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on management s plans, which include further implementation of its
business plan and continuing to raise funds through debt and/or equity raises.  

Note
2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Principles
of Consolidation    

The
Company consolidates the accounts of subsidiaries in which it has a controlling financial interest under the voting control model.
The financial statements include the accounts of STL Marketing Inc., and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and its 51% owned subsidiary
Kinver Technologies, Inc. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

Estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. The more significant
estimates and assumptions by management include, among others, the accrual of potential liabilities, and the assumptions used
in valuing derivatives and share-based instruments issued for services and financing. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Revenue    

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded its first sale of a PhoneSuite Solutions IP PBX product. Sales
are recognized when the following revenue criteria are met: the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, the product or service has been delivered, and collectability is reasonably assured.  

Share-Based
Compensation    

The
Company periodically issues stock options and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for
services and for financing costs. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based
on the authoritative guidance provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) whereas the value of the award is measured
on the date of grant and recognized over the vesting period. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and
vesting to non-employees in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the FASB whereas the value of the stock compensation
is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached, or b) at
the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Non-employee stock-based compensation
charges generally are amortized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. In certain circumstances where there are no
future performance requirements by the non-employee, option grants are immediately vested and the total stock-based compensation
charge is recorded in the period of the measurement date.  

Derivative
Financial Instruments    

The
Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify
as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument
is initially recorded at its fair value and is then revalued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in
the statements of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded
as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified
in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could
be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. To determine the number of authorized but unissued shares available to
satisfy outstanding convertible securities, the Company uses a sequencing method to prioritize its convertible securities as prescribed
by ASC 815-40-35. At each reporting date, the Company reviews its convertible securities to determine their classification is
appropriate.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

Under
current accounting guidance, fair value is defined as the price at which an asset could be exchanged or a liability transferred
in a transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where
observable prices or parameters are not available, valuation models are applied. A fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs
used in measuring fair value into three broad levels as follows:  

Level
1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  

  Level
2   Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, are observable either directly or indirectly.  

  Level
3   Unobservable inputs based on the Company s assumptions.  

The
Company is required to use observable market data if such data is available without undue cost and effort. As of September 30,
2016, the amounts reported for cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximated fair value because of their short-term
maturities. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, derivative liabilities of $3,079,395 and $3,037,500, respectively, were
valued using Level 2 inputs.  

Non-controlling
Interests    

The
Company accounts for the non-controlling interests in accordance with guidance issued by the FASB which defines a non-controlling
interest as the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. The guidance requires,
among other items, that a non-controlling interest be included in the consolidated balance sheets within equity separate from
the parent s equity and consolidated net income (loss) is reported inclusive of both the parent s and non-controlling
interest s shares and, separately, the amounts of consolidated net income (loss) attributable to the parent and non-controlling
interest in the consolidated statement of operations.  

Reverse
Stock Split    

In
October 2014, the Company s board of directors and stockholders approved an amended and restated certificate of incorporation
to affect a reverse split of shares of our common stock at a 1-for-15 ratio. The reverse split became effective in March 2015.
The par value and the authorized shares of the common and convertible preferred stock were not adjusted as a result of the reverse
split. All issued and outstanding common stock and per share amounts contained in the financial statements have been retroactively
adjusted to reflect this reverse split for all periods presented.  

Net
Loss per Common Share    

Basic
loss per share is computed by dividing net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding
common shares during the period. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss applicable to common stockholders
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding
if all dilutive potential common shares had been issued. Potential common shares are excluded from the computation when their
effect is anti-dilutive.  

At
September 30, 2016 and 2015, the dilutive impact of convertible debt and liability payable in shares have been excluded because
their impact on the loss per share is anti-dilutive as follows:  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements    

In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from
Contracts with Customers . ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing
revenue recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition.
ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in
the contract. The ASU also will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and
cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from
costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December
15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods
therein. Entities will be able to transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of
the date of adoption. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on the Company s financial statements
and disclosures.  

In
August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability
to Continue as a Going Concern,  which provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties
in the financial statements. ASU 2014-15 requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability
to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. An entity must provide certain
disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern. ASU
2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-15 on the Company s financial statements and disclosures.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02,  Leases.  ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to
record a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12
months. ASU 2016-02 is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption
is permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at,
or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical
expedients available. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 on the Company s financial statements
and disclosures.  

Other
recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact
on the Company s present or future consolidated financial statements.  

Note
3   Notes Payable   

Note
4   Notes Payable-Related Party   

Note
5   Convertible Notes Payable   

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, convertible notes consisted of the following:  

From
2009 to 2015, the Company issued Convertible Promissory Notes ( Notes ) to various accredited investors. The Notes
bear interest ranging from 8% to 12% per annum and mature on various dates from February 2010 to September 2016. The Company is
currently in default of payment for Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $888,103.  

At
September 30, 2016, the notes are convertible into shares of common stock of the Company at the option of the holder at price
per share discounts ranging from 10% to 75% of the Company s common stock trading market price during a certain time period
(usually 10-20 days) as defined in the notes. In addition, the conversion prices are subject to adjustment in certain events,
such as in conjunction with any sale, conveyance or disposition of all or substantially all of the Company s assets or consummation
of a transaction or series of related transactions in which the Company is not the surviving entity.  

As
of December 31, 2015, the principal balance of the Notes was $942,144. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
did not issue any new unsecured convertible notes and note holders converted $21,041 of principal and $92 of accrued interest
into 239,249,912 shares of the Company s common stock. At September 30, 2016, the principal balance of the Notes was $921,103.  

As
of December 31, 2015, the debt discount related to issuance of the Notes was $14,152. During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company recorded discount amortization of $14,152 and at September 30, 2016, debt discount was zero.  

The
Company considered the current FASB guidance on derivative accounting. As the ultimate determination of shares to be issued upon
conversion of these notes could exceed the current number of available authorized shares, the conversion feature of these notes
is recorded as a derivative liability (See Note 7).  

Management
and legal counsel have reviewed previous agreements and believe, pursuant to the Stock Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement effective
as of January 31, 2009 (the  2009 Agreement ) entered into by the Company (then known as Image Worldwide, Inc., a
Colorado corporation), Image Worldwide Marketing, Inc., a Delaware corporation and subsidiary of the Company ( Image Worldwide
Marketing Delaware ), and St. Louis Packaging, Inc., an Illinois corporation, that Image Worldwide Delaware should have
assumed all liabilities of the Company as of or prior to the 2009 Agreement. Management believes this amounts to $308,333 of debt
(including $265,000 of convertible debt), plus its related interest and derivatives. The Company is currently reviewing and weighing
its options and will proceed accordingly. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, this debt is included on the accompanying
consolidated financial statements.  

Note
6   Liabilities Payable in Shares   

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company has recorded $114,500 of liabilities payable in shares of its Common Stock
for services received from three unrelated parties in 2012 and 2014. Of the total, $60,000 is payable in shares at a price at
70% of the average of the lowest three closing bid prices, as defined, $15,000 is payable in shares using the average of the last
five trading days from date of service, as defined, and $39,500 is payable at the current price of the Company shares, as defined.
At September 30, 2016, the balance of $114,500 is convertible into 10,948,283,522 shares of Common Stock.  

The
Company considered the current FASB guidance on derivative accounting. As the ultimate determination of shares to be issued upon
payment of these liabilities could exceed the current number of available authorized shares, the conversion feature of these liabilities
is recorded as a derivative liability (See Note 7).  

Note
7   Derivative Liabilities   

Under
authoritative guidance issued by the FASB, debt instruments which do not have fixed settlement provisions, are deemed to be derivative
instruments. The conversion feature of the Company s convertible notes payable and liabilities payable in shares (described
in Note 5 and 6 above) did not have fixed settlement provisions because the ultimate determination of shares to be issued could
exceed current available authorized shares.  

In
accordance with the FASB authoritative guidance, the conversion feature of the financial instruments was separated from the host
contract and recognized as a derivative instrument. The conversion feature of the financial instruments had been characterized
as a derivative liability and was re-measured at the end of every reporting period with the change in value reported in the statement
of operations.  

At
December 31, 2015, the balance of the derivative liabilities was $3,037,500. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
convertible notes and accrued interest totaling $21,133 were converted into shares of common stock and the Company recorded a
gain of $18,640 related to the extinguishment of the corresponding derivative liability. As of September 30, 2016, the Company
re-measured the derivative liabilities and determined the fair value to be $3,079,395, and for the nine months ended September
30, 2016, recorded a loss on the change in fair value of derivatives of $60,534.  

The
derivative liability was valued at the following dates using a probability weighted Black-Scholes-Merton model with the following
assumptions:  

The risk-free interest rate
was based on rates established by the Federal Reserve Bank. The expected life of the conversion feature of the notes was based
on the remaining terms of the financial instruments, or if the financial instruments are in default, a period of one year. The
expected dividend yield was based on the fact that the Company has not customarily paid dividends to its common stockholders in
the past and does not expect to pay dividends to its common stockholders in the future. 

Note
8   Common Stock   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, 239,249,912 shares of common stock were issued to holders of various convertible notes
that converted $21,133 of principal and accrued interest.  

Note
9   Noncontrolling Interests    

On
May 25, 2016, the Company and Kinetos, S.A., a Costa Rican corporation and unrelated third party, formed Kinver Technologies,
Inc. ( Kinver ), a Florida corporation. Upon formation, the Company acquired 51% of the outstanding capital stock
of Kinver, and Kinetos acquired 49% of the outstanding capital stock of Kinver. As of September 30, 2016, Kinver has minimal operations.
The primary operations of Kinver are planned to be the sale and commercialization of the Hound Software product developed by Kinetos.  

The
following table is a summary of the noncontrolling interest for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:  

Note
10   Related Party Transactions   

Since
April 2010 through September 2016, management and board members have advanced funds to the Company for operating capital, paid
certain expenses on behalf of the Company, and deferred salaries and consulting fees. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to board members and companies owned by board members totaled $466,547 and
$436,123, respectively. These amounts are unsecured, non-interest bearing, and due on demand.  

For
the nine months ending September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred consulting expenses to a company that is owned by a board
member, of $22,500 and $22,500 respectively.  

Note
10  Commitments and Contingencies   

Payable
to Tarpon Bay Partners LLC    

In
2014, Tarpon Bay Partners LLC (Tarpon) assumed $519,282 of past due accounts payable of the Company from various creditors of
the Company. Tarpon then commenced an action against the Company to recover the aggregate of the past due accounts. On March 19,
2014, the Circuit Court of the Second Judicial Circuit for Leon County, Florida approved an agreement between the Company and
Tarpon, in which the Company agreed to issue shares of the Company s common stock to Tarpon sufficient to generate proceeds
equal to the aggregate of the past due accounts. In addition, Tarpon will receive a fee of approximately 33% based on the proceeds.
The Company will record the fees as the shares are issued and the past due accounts are paid. The past due amounts assumed are
recorded as current liabilities of the Company until settled under the assignment agreement.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not issue any shares of common stock to Tarpon in connection
with the agreement. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the balance due of $354,525 is included in accounts payable and
accrued liabilities on the accompanying balance sheets. A portion of the fees that Tarpon has received in 2014, has not been fully
documented by Tarpon to the Company as requested, and therefore are in dispute and are pending. For purposes of presentation in
the accompanying financial statements, we have recorded these fees as fees paid to Tarpon.  

As
part of the agreement with Tarpon, the Company issued to Tarpon two convertible notes aggregating $50,000, which were due in May
2014 and September 2014. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the notes total $41,680 and are included in the balance
of convertible notes payable, net of discount on the accompanying balance sheets. The notes are currently in default. At September
30, 2016, the amounts outstanding on the notes plus accrued interest was $51,302, and are convertible into 10,260,308,000 shares
of the Company s common stock.  

Litigations,
Claims and Assessments    

The
Company may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. However,
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise that may harm its business.
Other than the below litigation with the Costa Rican Investment Bank, the Company is currently not aware of any such legal proceedings
or claims that they believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse affect on its business, financial
condition or operating results.  

In
2012, the Company filed an arbitration claim with the  Centro Internacional de Conciliacion y Arbitraje  or  CICA 
alleging that Grupo Aldesa, S.A., its then investment bank, withheld $195,400 of investor funds from the Company in mid-2011 for
its own use and benefit and contrary to the executed agreement between the companies. The case claims that Aldesa received funds
from two investors and remitted 50% of those funds and keeping the balance without authorization. Additionally, the Company did
notify the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), as well as, the State Attorney General of both Delaware and Colorado in mid-2012.
Grupo Aldesa appealed to the Sala Primera de la Corte Suprema (the Supreme Court over these types of legal matters) in October
of 2012 claiming CICA did not have subject matter jurisdiction or the right to adjudicate the case. In a strongly worded opinion,
Sala Primera rejected Aldesa s appeal in the Company s favor.  

The
arbitration found that Grupo Aldesa did not perform an underwriting as they claimed in defense to withhold a 50% commission. The
arbitration also found that the commission was 5%, not 50%. However, the arbitrators reasoned that Versant Corporation breached
the contract by seeking arbitration. The Company believes there is no legal basis for this finding on Versant, as arbitration
is part of the signed contract between Aldesa and Versant. Yet, due to this finding, the Company cannot recover those funds on
behalf of the affected investors. The Company will now review its legal options, including seeking relief at the international
center for arbitration. Regardless, this action was taken by the Company to try and resolve this overcharge of its subscription
to Preferred Class A, while a private Company, on behalf of the investors. The funds in question are investor funds, so any funds
returned would be returned to the investors themselves.

Plan
of Operation   

The
Company has reported the delays in private power generation in Costa Rica and its effects on the Company. At this time, there
is no clear timing on when the government s policies and views will change, if ever. As previously reported, the Company
has significantly reduced or eliminated any expenditures or work in Costa Rica. If the delays in Costa Rica take much more time
to resolve themselves, it is entirely possible that the Company will cease pursuing the Power Purchase Agreement. Information
pertaining to these efforts can be found in previous filings.  

As
a result of the delays in Costa Rica, the Company has pivoted to technology, an area where executive management has significant
expertise and sales experience. The Company s efforts for the next 12 months are focused on software applications in the
following three areas: (i) PhoneSuite Solutions overseas sale of VoIP telecommunications equipment ( PBX Systems );
(ii) the commercialization, sale and adoption of F3TCH, a mobile APP designed to enhance a hotel guests interaction within the
hotel services worldwide; and (iii) the sale and commercialization of the Hound Software branded software platform comprised of
Data Wrangling, Analytics, Automated Workflow and Telecommunications modules.  

PhoneSuite
Solutions, Inc.   

We
are currently working to create a structure that will help garner more sales activity from our existing dealer base e.g. quotes,
meetings, demos etc. As reference, our PBX manufacturer recently stated that is has its five thousandth PBX system since its inception
(North America). This is a significant amount of market share in North America and we continue to try and leverage this as we
expand the brand s presence overseas.   

On
the technology front, we have successfully implemented the PhoneSuite Voiceware offering on our own cloud infrastructure to be
able to provide the contracted features to overseas properties as required by one of Call Management Products  ( CMP )
contracted customer- a major worldwide hotel chain. We chose a premier provider of cloud infrastructure services for this deployment
and look forward to pursuing new business opportunities for this, and other chains, overseas. Our cloud infrastructure is a very
reliable, redundant and powerful network from which to deliver the PhoneSuite product.  

We
feel confident on this solution, however we caution that adoption by hotels for a cloud based service has not gained as much momentum
as in the generic business community. However, in order to pursue the major chains overseas, we did need to have this offering
in place. We also do have a premise-based solution from CMP running Voiceware on a server or its Series2 configuration, which
gives a potential client more choices. 1   

F3TCH-
 Hotel Phones Just Got a Whole Lot Smarter    

On
February 11, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with Camposagrado, Inc. to exclusively license and commercialize Camposagrado s
patent pending Application or  App  to the worldwide hospitality industry (U.S. Pat. Application No. 14/877,595).
This Application, trademarked as F3TCH, migrates the hotel guestroom telephone to a user s smart device, including their
smartphone or tablet, and will allow the guest to utilize their own smart device as their point of contact within the hotel s
communications platform during their stay at a  F3TCH compatible  hotel. The App is intended to be free to users and
hotels and is monetized through the placement of advertisements on the Application.  

This
past quarter, the website and videos for F3TCH were released and made publicly available (www.f3tch.com). The Company is currently
fielding inquiries and has initiated a more robust social media strategy to gain more attention. Demo preparations are underway
and a full demo system should be available in August.  

Hound
Software   

The
Company formed Kinver Technologies, Inc., owned 51% by the Company and 49% by Kinetos, S.A. Kinver will market and commercialize
Hound Software in the United States.  

Hound s
core product is a complete software platform that is currently comprised of three distinct modules- Data Wrangling, Analytics,
and Automated Work Flow. These products can be sold as stand alone, or as a suite, and have powerful Big Data and Machine Learning
components. The Company has completed a revised website for Hound Software ( www.houndsoftware.net ) as well as various Social
Media sites.  

The
Company has begun marketing for the product.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015    

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company reported a net loss of $(899,409) and $(169,147) respectively.
The change in net loss between the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is primarily due to an increase in the loss on change
in the fair value of derivative liabilities. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 the Company reported derivative loss
of $(786,820) compared to a derivate loss of $(29,559) for the three months ended September 30, 2015. In addition, the Company
also reported its first sales of $9,066 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to zero sales for the three
months ended September 30, 2015.  

Operating
expenses increased by approximately one percent during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The increase in operating expenses is primarily attributed to a decrease in professional fees of $8,600
and an increase in general and administrative of $9,639 primarily related to the increase of marketing compared to the three months
ended September 30, 2015.

 Please note that   CMP is a separate company and not related to STL Marketing Group, Inc.    

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015    

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company reported a net loss of $(430,257) and $(1,327,103), respectively.
The change in net loss between the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is primarily due to a decrease in the loss on change
in the fair value of derivative liabilities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company reported derivative loss
of $(60,534) compared to a derivate loss of $(870,433) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In addition, the Company
also reported its first sales of $9,066 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to zero sales for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015.  

Operating
expenses decreased by roughly 17% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The $67,395 decrease in operating expenses is primarily attributed to the following changes in operating expenses: increase
in professional fees of $5,243 and decrease in general and administrative of $72,638 primarily related to the write off of $84,000
of deferred offering costs in 2015 and an increase in marketing and dues in 2016.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a net loss of $430,257 and used cash in operations of $117,881,
and at September 30, 2016, the Company had a stockholders  deficit of $6,438,513 and a working deficit of $6,457,602. These
factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, the Company s
independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on the Company s December 31, 2015 financial statements, has
raised substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue
as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to raise additional funds and implement its business plan. The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had cash on hand in the amount of $1,262. Management estimates that the current funds on hand
will not be sufficient to continue operations. We expect to be able to secure capital advances from our officers or principal
shareholders in order to pay our operating expenses over the next 12 months. In addition, management is currently seeking additional
funds, primarily through the issuance of debt and equity securities for cash to operate our business, and estimates that a significant
amount of capital will be necessary to advance the development of our projects to the point at which they will become commercially
viable.  

Net
cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was $(117,881) and $(132,836), respectively.
The Net Loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $(430,257) and $(1,327,103), respectively.  

Net
cash provided by all financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $118,350, as compared to $137,695 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company had an increase of
related party notes payable of $118,350.  

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates   

The
Company prepared its condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management periodically evaluates
the estimates and judgments made. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various factors
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates as a result of different
assumptions or conditions.  

The
following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Company s
condensed consolidated financial statements.  

Stock-Based
Compensation  

The
Company periodically grants stock options and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions as compensation
for services rendered. The Company accounts for stock option and stock warrant grants to employees based on the authoritative
guidance provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board where the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and
recognized over the vesting period. The Company accounts for stock option and stock warrant grants to non-employees in accordance
with the authoritative guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board where the value of the stock compensation is determined
based upon the measurement date at either a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached, or b) at the date at which
the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Non-employee stock-based compensation charges generally
are amortized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. In certain circumstances where there are no future performance
requirements by the non-employee, option or warrant grants are immediately vested and the total stock-based compensation charge
is recorded in the period of the measurement date.  

The
fair value of the Company s common stock option and warrant grants is estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model,
which uses certain assumptions related to risk-free interest rates, expected volatility, expected life of the common stock options,
and future dividends. Compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes option pricing model,
and based on actual experience. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model could materially affect compensation
expense recorded in future periods.  

Derivative
Financial Instruments  

The
Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify
as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument
is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported
in the statements of operations. The Company uses a probability weighted average Black-Scholes-Merton model to value the derivative
instruments. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities
or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance
sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within
12 months of the balance sheet date.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.   

(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Based
on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(c) and
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in report that we
file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
U.S Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in
the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

(b)
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act, during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II   OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings.   

Arbitration-
Grupo Aldesa    

In
2012, the Company filed an arbitration claim with the  Centro Internacional de Conciliacion y Arbitraje  or  CICA 
alleging that Grupo Aldesa, S.A., its then investment bank, withheld $195,400 of investor funds from the Company in mid-2011 for
its own use and benefit and contrary to the executed agreement between the companies. The case claims that Aldesa received funds
from two investors and remitted 50% of those funds and keeping the balance without authorization. Additionally, the Company did
notify the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), as well as, the State Attorney General of both Delaware and Colorado in mid-2012.
Grupo Aldesa appealed to the Sala Primera de la Corte Suprema (the Supreme Court over these types of legal matters) in October
of 2012 claiming CICA did not have subject matter jurisdiction or the right to adjudicate the case. In a strongly worded opinion
Sala Primera rejected Aldesa s appeal in the Company s favor. CICA has received the official notice from the Sala
Primera regarding the opinion and has taken up the case from where we were before the appeal.  

The
arbitration found that Grupo Aldesa did not perform an underwriting as it claimed and a reason for the close to 50% commission
it paid itself. The arbitration also found that the commission was 5%, however, the arbitrators reasoned that Versant Corporation
(Delaware private company) breached the contract by seeking arbitration. There is no legal basis for this finding as arbitration
is part of the contract Versant signed, however, it is the reason that the Company cannot recover those funds on behalf of the
affected investors. The Company will now review its legal options, including, seeking relief at the international center for arbitration,
as it is evident that the system in Costa Rica, as mentioned in other cases most notably Alcatel v. Grupo ICE, is corrupt. Regardless,
this action is to return to initial investors in Versant Corporation, a private Delaware Corporation, their funds, funds that
were overcharged by Grupo Aldesa. Regardless of further action, there is no material effect to the Company either way, if we pursue
and prevail, those funds go to the investors. The funds in question are investor funds, so any funds returned would be returned
to the investors themselves. This action was taken by the Company to try and resolve this overcharge of its subscription to Preferred
Class A, while a private Company, on behalf of the investors.  

Exchange
Under Section 3(a)(10)   

On
March 19, 2014, the Circuit Court of the Second Judicial Circuit in and for Leon County, Florida (the  Court ), entered
an order (the  Order ) approving, among other things, the fairness of the terms and conditions of an exchange pursuant
to Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), in accordance with a stipulation
of settlement (the  Settlement Agreement ) between STL Marketing Group, Inc., a Colorado corporation (the  Company ),
and Tarpon Bay Partners, LLC, a Florida limited liability company ( Tarpon ), in the matter entitled Tarpon Bay Partners,
LLC v. STL Marketing Group, Inc., Case No. 2014-CA-278 (the  Action ). Tarpon commenced the Action against the Company
on February 6, 2014 to recover an aggregate of $519,282 of past-due accounts payable of the Company, which Tarpon had purchased
from certain service providers of the Company pursuant to the terms of separate receivable purchase agreements between Tarpon
and each of such vendors (the  Assigned Accounts ), plus fees and costs (the  Claim ). The Assigned Accounts
relate to certain legal, accounting, and financial services. The Order provides for the full and final settlement of the Claim
and the Action. The Settlement Agreement became effective and binding upon the Company and Tarpon upon execution of the Order
by the Court on March 19, 2014. Please see the current report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
March 25, 2014.  

From
time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise, in the ordinary course of business.
However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time
to time that may harm our business. Except for the foregoing, we are not currently involved in any litigation that we believe
could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. There is no action, suit, proceeding,
inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board, government agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending
or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of our Company or any of our subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting our
Company, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries or of our Company s or our Company s subsidiaries  officers

The
issuances of these shares were made in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Sections 3(a)(9) and 4(a)(2) of
the Securities Act as the common stock was issued in exchange for debt securities of the registrant held by each shareholder,
there was no additional consideration for the exchange, there was no remuneration for the solicitation of the exchange, there
was no general solicitation, and the transactions did not involve a public offering  

Item

      Based

    to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect
    to the period covered by this report;   

3.  
      Based

    periods presented in this report;   

4.  
      The
    registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and

a)  
      designed

b)  
      designed
    such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under

c)  
      evaluated
    the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions

    in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s
    most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially
    affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting;
    and   

5.  
      The
    registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control
    over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors
    (or persons performing the equivalent functions):   

a)  
      all
    significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
    are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
    information; and   

b)  
      any
    fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s
