  Note 1. Nature of Operations and Liquidity  
   
  Overview  
   
 Aspen Group, Inc. (together with its subsidiary, the  Company  or  Aspen ) is a holding company. Its subsidiary Aspen University Inc. was founded in Colorado in 1987 as the International School of Information Management. On September 30, 2004, it changed its name to Aspen University Inc. ( Aspen University ). On March 13, 2012, the Company was recapitalized in a reverse merger. All references to the Company or Aspen before March 13, 2012 are to Aspen University. 
   
 Aspen s mission is to offer any motivated college-worthy student the opportunity to receive a high quality, responsibly priced distance-learning education for the purpose of achieving sustainable economic and social benefits for themselves and their families. Aspen is dedicated to providing the highest quality education experiences taught by top-tier professors - 57% of our adjunct professors hold doctorate degrees. 
   
 Because we believe higher education should be a catalyst to our students  long-term economic success, we exert financial prudence by offering affordable tuition that is one of the greatest values in online higher education. In 2014, Aspen University unveiled a monthly payment plan aimed at reversing the college-debt sentence plaguing working-class Americans. The monthly payment plan offers bachelor students (except RN to BSN) the opportunity to pay their tuition at $250/month for 72 months ($18,000), nursing bachelor students (RN to BSN) $250/month for 39 months ($9,750), master students $325/month for 36 months ($11,700) and doctoral students $375/month for 72 months ($27,000), interest free, thereby giving students a monthly payment tuition payment option versus taking out a federal financial aid loan. 
   
 On November 10, 2014, Aspen University announced the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education ( CCNE ) has granted accreditation to its Bachelor of Science in Nursing program (RN to BSN) until December 31, 2019.  
   
 Since 1993, we have been nationally accredited by the Distance Education and Accrediting Council ( DEAC ), a national accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education (the  DOE ). On February 25, 2015, the DEAC informed Aspen University that it had renewed its accreditation for five years to January, 2019. 
   
  Basis of Presentation  
   
  A. Interim Financial Statements  
   
 The interim consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). In the opinion of the Company s management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments and reclassifications and non-recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly our results of operations for the three and six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, our cash flows for the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, and our financial position as of October 31, 2016 have been made. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full year. 
   
 Certain information and disclosures normally included in the notes to the annual consolidated financial statements have been condensed or omitted from these interim consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, these interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Report on Form 10-K for the period ended April 30, 2016 as filed with the SEC on July 27, 2016. The April 30, 2016 balance sheet is derived from those statements.

B. Liquidity  
   
 In August 2016, the Company closed on a $3 million credit line with its largest shareholder. The credit line, whose terms include a 12% per annum interest rate on drawn funds and a 2% per annum interest rate on undrawn funds, will extend through August 2019.  The Company initially drew down $750,000 under the line, of which approximately $248,000 was used to repay a secured line of credit with a bank. (See Note 8) 
   
 At October 31, 2016, the Company had a cash balance of approximately $700,000. The Company had cash provided from operating activities of $26,323. 
   
 On April 22, 2016, the Company issued 4,855,487 shares of common stock to two of its warrant holders in exchange for their early exercise of warrants at a reduced exercise price of $0.155 per share. The Company received gross proceeds of $752,500 from these exercises. As a condition of the warrant holders exercising their warrants, Mr. Michael Mathews, the Company s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, converted a $300,000 note and in connection with this conversion, Mr. Mathews was issued 1,591,053 shares of common stock. See Note 7. With the additional cash raised in the financings, the growth in revenues and improving operating margins, the Company believes that it has sufficient cash to allow the Company to implement its long-term business plan.  
   
  Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies  
   
  Principles of Consolidation  
   
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Aspen Group, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
   
  Use of Estimates  
   
 The preparation of the unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the unaudited consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts and other receivables, the valuation of collateral on certain receivables, amortization periods and valuation of courseware and software development costs, valuation of beneficial conversion features in convertible debt, valuation of derivative instruments, valuation of loss contingencies, valuation of stock-based compensation and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. 
   
  Cash and Cash Equivalents  
   
 For the purposes of the unaudited consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents at October 31, 2016 and April 30, 2016. The Company maintains its cash in bank and financial institution deposits that at times may exceed federally insured limits of $250,000 per financial institution. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts from inception through October 31, 2016. As of October 31, 2016 and April 30, 2016, there were deposits totaling $426,487 and $1,224,863 respectively, held in two separate institutions greater   than the federally insured limits.

Fair Value Measurements  
   
 Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The Company classifies assets and liabilities recorded at fair value under the fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques. Observable inputs (highest level) reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs (lowest level) reflect internally developed market assumptions. The fair value measurements are classified under the following hierarchy: 
   
 Level 1 Observable inputs that reflect quoted market prices (unadjusted) for identical assets and liabilities in active markets; 
 Level 2 Observable inputs, other than quoted market prices, that are either directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace for identical or similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets and liabilities; and 
 Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity that are significant to the fair value of assets or liabilities. 
   
 The estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. 
   
  Refunds Due Students  
   
 The Company receives Title IV funds from the Department of Education to cover tuition and living expenses. After deducting tuition and fees, the Company sends checks for the remaining balances to the students. 
   
  Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue  
   
 Revenues consist primarily of tuition and fees derived from courses taught by the Company online as well as from related educational resources that the Company provides to its students, such as access to our online materials and learning management system. Tuition revenue is recognized pro-rata over the applicable period of instruction. The Company allows a student to make three monthly tuition payments during each class. The Company maintains an institutional tuition refund policy, which provides for all or a portion of tuition to be refunded if a student withdraws during stated refund periods. Certain states in which students reside impose separate, mandatory refund policies, which override the Company s policy to the extent in conflict. If a student withdraws at a time when a portion or none of the tuition is refundable, then in accordance with its revenue recognition policy, the Company recognizes as revenue the tuition that was not refunded. Since the Company recognizes revenue pro-rata over the term of the course and because, under its institutional refund policy, the amount subject to refund is never greater than the amount of the revenue that has been deferred, under the Company s accounting policies revenue is not recognized with respect to amounts that could potentially be refunded. The Company s educational programs have starting and ending dates that differ from its fiscal quarters. Therefore, at the end of each fiscal quarter, a portion of revenue from these programs is not yet earned and is therefore deferred. The Company also charges students annual fees for library, technology and other services, which are recognized over the related service period. Deferred revenue represents the amount of tuition, fees, and other student payments received in excess of the portion recognized as revenue and it is included in current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Other revenues may be recognized as sales occur or services are performed. 
   
 The Company has revenues from students outside the United States representing 3.5% of the revenues for the quarter ended October 31, 2016.  
   
  Accounting for Derivatives  
   
 The Company evaluates its convertible instruments, options, warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for under ASC Topic 815,  Derivatives and Hedging . The result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the derivative is marked-to-market each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as other income (expense). Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity. Equity instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification under ASC Topic 815 are reclassified to liability at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date.

Net Income (Loss) Per Share  
   
 Net income (loss) per common share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Options to purchase 22,197,979 and 16,857,313 common shares, warrants to purchase 11,214,659 and 28,871,757 common shares, and $350,000 and $650,000 of convertible debt (convertible into 907,143 and 1,207,143 common shares, respectively) were outstanding during three months ending October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, but during certain periods were not included in the computation of diluted loss per share because the effects would have been anti-dilutive. The options, warrants and convertible debt are considered to be common stock equivalents and are only included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share when their effect is dilutive, as noted in the chart below. 
   
 Basic and diluted income per share for the three months ended October 31, 2016, were calculated as follows: 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
   
 There have been no new relevant pronouncements since those disclosed in the April 30, 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements. 
   
  Note 3. Secured Note and Accounts Receivable   Related Parties  
   
 On March 30, 2008 and December 1, 2008, Aspen University sold courseware pursuant to marketing agreements to Higher Education Management Group, Inc. ( HEMG ,) which was then a related party and principal stockholder of the Company. HEMG s president is Mr. Patrick Spada, the former Chairman of the Company, the sold courseware amounts were $455,000 and $600,000, respectively; UCC filings were filed accordingly.  Under the marketing agreements, the receivables were due net 60 months. On September 16, 2011, HEMG pledged 772,793 Series C preferred shares (automatically converted to 654,850 common shares on March 13, 2012) of the Company as collateral for this account receivable which at that time had a remaining balance of $772,793. Based on the reduction in value of the collateral to $0.19 based on the then current price of the Company s common stock, the Company recognized an expense of $123,647 during the year ended April 30, 2014 as an additional allowance. As of October 31, 2016 and April 30, 2016, the balance of the account receivable, net of allowance, was $45,329. 
   
 HEMG has failed to pay to Aspen University any portion of the $772,793 amount due as of September 30, 2014, despite due demand for same. Consequently, on November 18, 2014 Aspen University filed a complaint vs. HEMG in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, to collect the full amount due to the Company. HEMG defaulted and Aspen University obtained a default judgment. In addition, Aspen University gave notice to HEMG that it intended to privately sell the 654,850 shares after March 10, 2015. On April 29, 2015, the Company sold those shares to a private investor for $0.155 per share or $101,502, which proceeds reduced the receivable balance to $671,291 with a remaining allowance of $625,963, resulting in a net receivable of $45,329. (See Notes 8 and 10)

Note 6. Loan Payable Officer   Related Party  
   
 On June 28, 2013, the Company received $1,000,000 as a loan from the Company s Chief Executive Officer. This loan was for a term of 6 months with an annual interest rate of 10%, payable monthly. Through various note extensions, the debt was extended to May 5, 2018. There was no accounting effect for these extensions. 
   
  Note 7. Convertible Notes, Convertible Notes   Related Party   
   
 On February 29, 2012, a loan payable of $50,000 was converted into a two-year convertible promissory note, bearing interest of 0.19% per annum. Beginning March 31, 2012, the note was convertible into common shares of the Company at the rate of $1.00 per share. The Company evaluated the convertible note and determined that, for the embedded conversion option, there was no beneficial conversion value to record as the conversion price is considered to be the fair market value of the common shares on the note issue date. This loan (now a convertible promissory note) was originally due in February 2014.  The amount due under this note has been reserved for payment upon the note being tendered to the Company by the note holder.

On March 13, 2012, the Company s CEO loaned the Company $300,000 and received a convertible promissory note due March 31, 2013, bearing interest at 0.19% per annum. The note is convertible into common shares of the Company at the rate of $1.00 per share upon five days written notice to the Company. The Company evaluated the convertible note and determined that, for the embedded conversion option, there was no beneficial conversion value to record as the conversion price is considered to be the fair market value of the common shares on the note issue date. Through various note extensions, the debt was extended to May 5, 2018. There was no accounting effect for these modifications. On April 22, 2016, the CEO converted the loan and accrued interest into common stock. The loan was converted at $0.19 per share and the Company issued 1,591,053 shares of common stock.  The note modification was treated as a debt extinguishment under ASC 470-50. There was no gain or loss on this debt extinguishment. The Company evaluated the convertible notes and determined that, for the embedded conversion option there was no beneficial conversion value to record as the conversion price exceeded the fair market value of the common shares on the note issue dates. 
   
 On August 14, 2012, the Company s CEO loaned the Company $300,000 and received a convertible promissory note, payable on demand, bearing interest at 5% per annum. The note is convertible into shares of common stock of the Company at a rate of $0.35 per share (based on proceeds received on September 28, 2012 under a private placement at $0.35 per unit). The Company evaluated the convertible notes and determined that, for the embedded conversion option, there was no beneficial conversion value to record as the conversion price is considered to be the fair market value of the shares of common stock on the note issue date. Through various note extensions, the debt was extended to May 5, 2018. There was no accounting effect for these modifications. 
   
  Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies  
   
  Line of Credit  
   
 In August 2016, the Company closed on a $3 million credit line with its largest shareholder. The credit line, whose terms include a 12% per annum interest rate on drawn funds and a 2% per annum interest rate on undrawn funds, will extend through August 2019.  The Company initially drew down $750,000 under the line, of which approximately $248,000 was used to repay a secured line of credit with a bank as noted below. Additionally, the Company paid a 2% origination fee of $60,000 and issued 750,000 common-stock warrants at an exercise price of $0.20 per share, which are redeemable by the Company if the closing price of its common stock averages at least $0.25 per share for 10 consecutive trading days.  The origination fee and $52,500 value of the 750,000 warrants (see note 11) were recorded as debt discounts to be amortized over the term of the line.  Amortization expense was $6,250 as of October 31, 2016. 
   
 The Company maintained a line of credit with a bank, up to a maximum credit line of $250,000.  In September 2016, the line of credit with the bank was paid and terminated.  
   
  Employment Agreements  
   
 From time to time, the Company enters into employment agreements with certain of its employees. These agreements typically include bonuses, some of which are performance-based in nature. As of October 31, 2016, no performance bonuses have been earned.  
   
  Legal Matters  
   
 On August 13, 2015, a former employee filed a complaint against the Company in the United States District Court, District of Arizona, for breach of contract claiming that Plaintiff was terminated for  Cause  when no cause existed. Plaintiff sought the remaining amounts under her employment agreement, severance pay, bonuses, value of lost benefits, and the loss of the value of her stock options. The Company filed an answer to the complaint by the September 8, 2015 deadline. That matter has been fully and finally settled for $69,000 as of June 2016 and has been dismissed. The Company accrued $87,500 in accordance with ASC 450-20-55-11 and is included in accrued expenses at April 30, 2016.  The amount owed was paid in the six months ended October 31, 2016.

Regulatory Matters  
   
 The Company s subsidiary, Aspen University, is subject to extensive regulation by Federal and State governmental agencies and accrediting bodies. In particular, the Higher Education Act (the  HEA ) and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the DOE subject Aspen University to significant regulatory scrutiny on the basis of numerous standards that schools must satisfy to participate in the various types of federal student financial assistance programs authorized under Title IV of the HEA. Aspen University has had provisional certification to participate in the Title IV Programs. That provisional certification imposes certain regulatory restrictions including, but not limited to, a limit of 1,200 student recipients for Title IV funding for the duration of the provisional certification. The provisional certification restrictions continue with regard to Aspen University s participation in Title IV Programs. 
   
 To participate in the Title IV Programs, an institution must be authorized to offer its programs of instruction by the relevant agencies of the State in which it is located. In addition, an institution must be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the DOE and certified as eligible by the DOE. The DOE will certify an institution to participate in the Title IV Programs only after the institution has demonstrated compliance with the HEA and the DOE s extensive academic, administrative, and financial regulations regarding institutional eligibility and certification. An institution must also demonstrate its compliance with these requirements to the DOE on an ongoing basis. Aspen University performs periodic reviews of its compliance with the various applicable regulatory requirements. As Title IV funds received in fiscal 2016 represented approximately 28% of the Company's cash basis revenues (including revenues from discontinued operations), as calculated in accordance with Department of Education guidelines, the loss of Title IV funding would have a material effect on the Company's future financial performance. 
   
 On March 27, 2012 and on August 31, 2012, Aspen University provided the DOE with letters of credit for which the due date was extended to December 31, 2013. On January 30, 2014, the DOE provided Aspen University with an option to become permanently certified by increasing the letter of credit to 50% of all Title IV funds received in the last program year, equaling $1,696,445, or to remain provisionally certified by increasing the 25% letter of credit to $848,225. Aspen informed the DOE of its desire to remain provisionally certified and posted the $848,225 letter of credit for the DOE on April 14, 2014. On February 26, 2015, Aspen University was informed by the DOE that it again had the option to become permanently certified by increasing the letter of credit to 50% of all Title IV funds received in the last program year, equaling $2,244,971, or to remain provisionally certified by increasing the existing 25% letter of credit to $1,122,485. Aspen informed the DOE on March 3, 2015 of its desire to remain provisionally certified and post the $1,122,485 letter of credit for the DOE by April 30, 2015. In November of 2015, the DOE informed Aspen that they no longer need to post a letter of credit. It was subsequently released. The DOE may impose additional or different terms and conditions in any final provisional program participation agreement that it may issue. 
   
 The HEA requires accrediting agencies to review many aspects of an institution's operations in order to ensure that the education offered is of sufficiently high quality to achieve satisfactory outcomes and that the institution is complying with accrediting standards. Failure to demonstrate compliance with accrediting standards may result in the imposition of probation, the requirements to provide periodic reports, the loss of accreditation or other penalties if deficiencies are not remediated. 
   
 Because Aspen University operates in a highly regulated industry, it may be subject from time to time to audits, investigations, claims of noncompliance or lawsuits by governmental agencies or third parties, which allege statutory violations, regulatory infractions or common law causes of action. 
   
 On February 25, 2015, the DEAC informed Aspen University that it had renewed its accreditation for five years to January, 2019. 
   
  Return of Title IV Funds  
   
 An institution participating in Title IV Programs must correctly calculate the amount of unearned Title IV Program funds that have been disbursed to students who withdraw from their educational programs before completion and must return those unearned funds in a timely manner, no later than 45 days of the date the school determines that the student has withdrawn. Under Department regulations, failure to make timely returns of Title IV Program funds for 5% or more of students sampled on the institution's annual compliance audit in either of its two most recently completed fiscal years can result in the institution having to post a letter of credit in an amount equal to 25% of its required Title IV returns during its most recently completed fiscal year. If unearned funds are not properly calculated and returned in a timely manner, an institution is also subject to monetary liabilities or an action to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate its participation in Title IV Programs.

Subsequent to a program review by the Department of Education, the Company recognized that it had not fully complied with all requirements for calculating and making timely returns of Title IV funds (R2T4). In November 2013, the Company returned a total of $102,810 of Title IV funds to the Department of Education. 
   
  Delaware Approval to Confer Degrees  
   
 Aspen University is a Delaware corporation. Delaware law requires an institution to obtain approval from the Delaware Department of Education ( Delaware DOE ) before it may incorporate with the power to confer degrees. In July 2012, Aspen received notice from the Delaware DOE that it was granted provisional approval status effective until June 30, 2015. On April 25, 2016 the Delaware DOE informed Aspen University it was granted full approval to operate with degree-granting authority in the State of Delaware until July 1, 2020. Aspen University is authorized by the Colorado Commission on Education to operate in Colorado as a degree granting institution.

Stock Incentive Plan and Stock Option Grants to Employees and Directors  
   
 Immediately following the closing of the Reverse Merger, on March 13, 2012, the Company adopted the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the  Plan ) that provides for the grant of 9,300,000 shares, 14,300,000 effective July 2014, 16,300,000 effective September 2014, 20,300,000 effective November 2015 and 25,300,000 effective June 2016, in the form of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted shares, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock units to employees, consultants, officers and directors. As of October 31, 2016, there were 3,102,021 shares remaining under the Plan for future issuance. The Company estimates the fair value of share-based compensation utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is dependent upon several variables such as the expected option term, expected volatility of the Company s stock price over the expected term, expected risk-free interest rate over the expected option term, expected dividend yield rate over the expected option term, and an estimate of expected forfeiture rates. The Company believes this valuation methodology is appropriate for estimating the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors which are subject to ASC Topic 718 requirements. These amounts are estimates and thus may not be reflective of actual future results, nor amounts ultimately realized by recipients of these grants. The Company recognizes compensation on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each award. The following table summarizes the assumptions the Company utilized to record compensation expense for stock options granted to employees during the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015. 

The Company utilized the simplified method to estimate the expected life for stock options granted to employees. The simplified method was used as the Company does not have sufficient historical data regarding stock option exercises. The expected volatility is based on the average of the expected volatilities from the most recent audited financial statements available for comparative public companies that are deemed to be similar in nature to the Company. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yields with terms equivalent to the expected life of the related option at the time of the grant. Dividend yield is based on historical trends. While the Company believes these estimates are reasonable, the compensation expense recorded would increase if the expected life was increased, a higher expected volatility was used, or if the expected dividend yield increased. 
   
 A summary of the Company s stock option activity for employees and directors during the six months ended October 31, 2016, is presented below: 

On May 19, 2016, the Company granted to each of its eight non-employee directors 150,000 five-year stock options. The Company granted an additional 50,000 five-year stock options to the chairman of the Compensation Committee and to the chairman of the Audit Committee.  These options are exercisable at $0.16 and vest in three years.  For the directors receiving 150,000, the fair value was approximately $7,500 per grant and for the two directors receiving 200,000 options, the fair value on the date of grant was approximately $10,000.

On June 23, 2016, the Company granted 2,000,000 stock options to the Chief Operating Officer, 700,000 stock options to the Chief Academic Officer and 300,000 to the Chief Financial Officer. The five-year options are exercisable at a price of $0.166 and vest over three years. On the date of grant, the grant to the Chief Operating Officer had a fair value of approximately $100,000, the grant to the Chief Academic Officer had a fair value of approximately $35,000 and the grant to the Chief Financial Officer had a fair value of approximately $15,000. 
   
 As of October 31, 2016, there was approximately $583,000 of unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.7 years. 
   
 The Company recorded compensation expense of $157,335 for the six months ended October 31, 2016 in connection with employee stock options. The Company recorded compensation expense of $128,987 for the six months ended October 31, 2015 in connection with employee stock options. 
   
 On September 12, 2016, the Company extended approximately 5 million options that were expiring in 2017.  The new expiration dates were extended three years.  The cost associated with these extensions is approximately $150,000, which represents the difference between the fair value of the options before the modification and the fair value immediately after the modification.  These extended options will vest over the next three years.   
   
  Stock Option Grants to Non-Employees  
   
 There were no stock options granted to non-employees during six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015. The Company recorded no compensation expense for the six months ended October 31, 2016 in connection with non-employee stock options. There was no unrecognized compensation cost at October 31, 2016.

  Note 11. Fair Value Measurements   Warrant Derivative liability  
   
  The accounting standard for fair value measurements provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The accounting standard established a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows. Level 1 input are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on the Company s own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. An asset or liability s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.      
   
 You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in the Risk Factors contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on July 27, 2016 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. 
   
 All references to  we,   our  and  us  refer to Aspen Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (including Aspen), unless the context otherwise indicates. In referring to academic matters, these words refer solely to Aspen University. 
   
  Company Overview  
   
 Founded in 1987, Aspen s mission is to offer any motivated college-worthy student the opportunity to receive a high quality, responsibly priced distance-learning education for the purpose of achieving sustainable economic and social benefits for themselves and their families. Aspen is dedicated to providing the highest quality education experiences taught by top-tier professors - 57% of our adjunct professors hold doctorate degrees. 
   
 Because we believe higher education should be a catalyst to our students  long-term economic success, we exert financial prudence by offering affordable tuition that is one of the greatest values in online higher education. In 2014, Aspen University unveiled a monthly payment plan aimed at reversing the college-debt sentence plaguing working-class Americans. The monthly payment plan offers bachelor students (except RN to BSN) the opportunity to pay their tuition at $250/month for 72 months ($18,000), nursing bachelor students (RN to BSN) $250/month for 39 months ($9,750), master students $325/month for 36 months ($11,700) and doctoral students $375/month for 72 months ($27,000), interest free, thereby giving students a monthly payment tuition payment option versus taking out a federal financial aid loan. 
   
 One of the key differences between Aspen and other publicly-traded, exclusively online, for-profit universities is the fact that the majority of our active degree-seeking students (68% as of October 31, 2016) were enrolled in Aspen s School of Nursing.  
   
  Student Population Overview*  
   
 Aspen s active degree-seeking student body increased year-over-year by 54% during the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2016, from 2,422 to 3,726 students.  
   
 Our most popular school is our School of Nursing. Aspen s School of Nursing has grown from 57% of our active degree-seeking student body at October 31, 2015, to 68% at October 31, 2016. Aspen s School of Nursing grew from 1,379 to 2,538 student s year-over-year, which represented 89% of Aspen s active degree-seeking student body growth. At October 31, 2016, Aspen s School of Nursing included 1,493 active students in the RN to BSN program and 1,045 active students in the MSN program or the RN to MSN Bridge program. 
   
  * Note: Aspen has revised its degree seeking student body definition to only report  Active Degree-Seeking Students.   Active Degree-Seeking Students  are defined as students who were enrolled in a course during the quarter reported, or are registered for an upcoming course. Aspen is using this definition going forward because it s more closely aligned with the definitions used by other publicly traded, for-profit institutions.   
   
  New Student Enrollment and Active Degree Seeking Student Body Growth  
   
 Since the launch of the BSN marketing campaign in November, 2014, Aspen s growth rate of new student enrollments has accelerated significantly. Below is a quarterly analysis of the growth of Aspen s new student enrollments, as well as the growth of the active degree seeking student body over the past seven quarters, including the recent quarter ending October 31, 2016. 

18 

Aspen s School of Nursing is responsible for the vast majority of the new student enrollment and overall active student body growth. Specifically, Aspen s School of Nursing is now on pace to grow on an annualized basis by approximately 1,320 Active Nursing students   net of student graduations and withdrawals (or ~110/month). Aspen s BSN program accounts for 68% of that growth, as that program is on pace to increase on an annualized basis by approximately 900 students   net (or ~75/month). 
   
 Aspen University expects its total active degree-seeking student body to continue its rapid growth and reach approximately 4,500 students by the end of the fiscal year, April 30, 2017. Therefore, the university is on pace to increase its active student body by ~1,600 students on an annualized basis in fiscal year 2017 versus the previous pace of ~950 active students a year ago, an improvement of 68% year-over-year. 
   
  Nursing Revenue Summary  
   
 Below is a summary of the Nursing active degree-seeking student body as a percentage of the total active degree-seeking student body over the past six fiscal quarters, as well as the Nursing degree-seeking revenue as a percentage of total revenues. Because Nursing average more course completions per year and the average tuition price per course is higher (all Nursing courses are $975/course) as compared to non-Nursing students, Nursing students today represent 71% of total revenues. 

Monthly Payment Programs Overview  
   
 Since the March 2014 monthly payment plan announcement, 59% of courses are now paid through monthly payment methods (based on courses started over the last 90 days). Aspen offers two monthly payment programs, a monthly payment plan in which students make payments every month over a fixed period (36, 39 or 72 months depending on the degree program), and a monthly installment plan in which students pay three monthly installments (day 1, day 31 and day 61 after the start of each course). 
   
 As of October 31, 2016, Aspen had 1,970 active students paying through a monthly payment plan, and 238 students paying through a monthly installment plan, for a total of 2,208 active students paying tuition through a monthly payment method. Additionally, Aspen is currently on pace to add approximately 75 active students/month net to its monthly payment programs through fiscal year 2017. Monthly recurring tuition cash payments for monthly payment programs is approximately $550,000 per month, as compared to approximately $150,000 per month a year ago. 
   
 Finally, as a consequence of monthly payment programs becoming the payment method of choice among the majority of Aspen s degree-seeking student body, our HEA, Title IV Program revenue dropped from 33% of total cash receipts in fiscal year 2015 to approximately 28% for fiscal year 2016.  
   
  Marketing Efficiency Analysis  
   
    Aspen has developed a marketing efficiency ratio to continually monitor the performance of its business model.  
   
  Revenue per Enrollment (RPE)  
  Marketing Efficiency Ratio =   
                 
  Cost per Enrollment (CPE)  
   
   Cost per Enrollment (CPE)   
  The Cost per Enrollment measures the marketing investment spent in a given quarter, divided by the number of new student enrollments achieved in that given quarter, in order to obtain an average CPE for the quarter measured.  

19 

Revenue per Enrollment (RPE)   
  The Revenue per Enrollment takes each quarterly cohort of new degree-seeking student enrollments, and measures the amount of earned revenue including tuition and fees to determine the average RPE for the cohort measured. For the later periods of a cohort, in particular students four years or older, we have used reasonable projections based off of historical results to determine the amount of revenue we will earn in later periods of the cohort.   
   
    We created the reporting to track the CPE and RPE starting in 2012 and can accurately predict the CPE and RPE for each new student cohort. Our current CPE/RPE Marketing Efficiency Ratio is reflected in the below table.   
   
   Quarterly New Student Cohort Actuals Data   :  

The Average RPE is approximately $7,000. Of the $7,000, $6,400 of the RPE is earned through tuition, with the remaining $600 on average earned through miscellaneous fees (includes annual technology fee, withdrawal fees, graduation fees, proctored exams, course specific fees, etc.)  
   
 Aspen is projecting to average a Marketing Efficiency Ratio of 9.7x, in other words a 9.7x return on our marketing investment. Third-party companies in the higher education industry that manage the Enrollment and Marketing functions on behalf of Universities (also referred to as Managed Services companies) reportedly average 3-4x return on their marketing investments, meaning that Aspen s business model is currently performing at more than double the efficiency level of that sector. 
   
   Results of Operations   
   
  For the Quarter Ended October 31, 2016 Compared with the Quarter Ended October 31, 2015  
   
  Revenue  
   
 Revenue from operations for the quarter ended October 31, 2016 ( 2016 Quarter ) increased to $3,465,026 from $1,913,161 for the quarter ended October 31, 2015 ( 2015 Quarter ), an increase of $1,551,865 or 81%.  
   
 New class starts begun in the 2016 quarter rose to 3,730 from 2,238 for the 2015 quarter, an increase of 67%.  The average tuition price of the new class starts rose to $819 for the 2016 quarter from $786 for the 2015 quarter, an increase of 4%. 

20 

Cost of Revenues (exclusive of amortization)  
   
 The Company s cost of revenues consists of instructional costs and services and marketing and promotional costs. 
   
  Instructional Costs and Services  
   
 Instructional costs and services for the 2016 Quarter rose to $547,863 from $384,854 for the 2015 Quarter, an increase of $163,009 or 42%.   
   
 Note that instructional costs and services for the 2016 Quarter dropped to 16% of revenues, as compared to 20% of revenues for the 2015 Quarter.  As student enrollment levels continue to rise, Aspen anticipates the growth rate in instructional costs and services will continue to lag that of overall revenue growth as a result of the Company commencing in early-2016 with a full-time faculty conversion model which saves approximately $50,000 per year for each adjunct faculty member that is converted to full-time status. Depending upon how successful Aspen is in converting faculty to full-time status, we estimate annualized savings of over $500,000.  
   
  Marketing and Promotional  
   
 Marketing and promotional costs for the 2016 Quarter were $686,993 compared to $482,947 for the 2015 Quarter, an increase of $204,046 or 42%. The Company expects marketing and promotional costs to rise in future periods, given we expect to increase monthly marketing spend to approximately $360,000 by the end of the 2017 fiscal year. 
   
 Gross Profit rose to 61% of revenues or $2,102,183 for the 2016 Quarter from 48% of revenues or $909,019 for the 2015 Quarter. 
   
  Costs and Expenses  
   
  General and Administrative  
   
 General and Administrative costs for the 2016 Quarter were $1,919,653 compared to $1,610,202 during the 2015 Quarter, an increase of $309,451 or 19%. A significant portion of this increase is the approximate $360,000 increase in payroll, primarily due to the headcount of our enrollment center increasing by 82% year-over-year. General and Administrative costs as a percentage of revenue for the 2016 Quarter declined to 55% compared to 84% during the 2015 Quarter. 
   
 From a sequential perspective, excluding the extraordinary one-time, non-recurring and other expenses incurred in the July 30, 2016 quarter of $269,000 ($206,000 expense associated with the surrender of warrants and a $69,000 expense resulting from a former employee litigation settlement), General and Administrative costs only rose by $12,575.  
   
  Depreciation and Amortization  
   
 Depreciation and amortization costs for the 2016 Quarter declined to $139,005 from $148,258 for the 2015 Quarter, a decrease of $9,253 or 6%.  
   
  Other Expense, net  
   
 Other expense, net for the 2016 Quarter increased to $54,971 from $31,320 in the 2015 Quarter, an increase of $23,651 or 76%. 
   
  Income Taxes  
   
 Income taxes expense (benefit) for the comparable years was $0 as Aspen Group experienced operating losses in both periods. As management made a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets stemming from these losses, there was no tax benefit recorded in the statement of operations in both periods. 
   
  Net Income  
   
 Net Income for 2016 Quarter was $116,541 as compared to a loss of ($744,420) for the 2015 Quarter, an improvement of $860,961 or approximately 116%. Contributing to this improvement was the year-over-year increase in revenues of $1,551,865 or 81% in the 2016 Quarter growing at a significantly higher rate than the increase of General and Administrative costs of only 19%. 

21 

For the Six Months Ended October 31, 2016 Compared with the Six Months Ended October 31, 2015  
   
  Revenue  
   
 Revenue from operations for the six months ended October 31, 2016 ( 2016 Period ) increased to $6,221,841 from $3,619,022 for the six months ended October 31, 2015 ( 2015 Period ), an increase of $2,602,819 or 72%.  
   
  Cost of Revenues (exclusive of amortization)  
   
 The Company s cost of revenues consist of instructional costs and services and marketing and promotional costs. 
   
  Instructional Costs and Services  
   
 Instructional costs and services for the 2016 Period rose to $1,007,062 from $770,921 for the 2015 Period, an increase of $236,141 or 31%.  
   
 As student enrollment levels continue to rise, Aspen anticipates the growth rate in instructional costs and services will continue to lag that of overall revenue growth as a result of the Company commencing in early-2016 with a full-time faculty conversion model which saves approximately $50,000 per year for each adjunct faculty member that is converted to full-time status. Depending upon how successful Aspen is in converting faculty to full-time status, we estimate annualized savings of over $500,000.  
   
  Marketing and Promotional  
   
 Marketing and promotional costs for the 2016 Period were $1,123,853 compared to $870,989 for the 2015 Period, an increase of $252,864 or 29%. The Company expects marketing and promotional costs to rise in future periods, given we expect to increase monthly marketing spend to approximately $360,000 by the end of the 2017 fiscal year. 
   
 Gross Profit rose to 61% of revenues or $3,822,857 for the 2016 Quarter from 47% of revenues or $1,708,251 for the 2015 Quarter. 
   
  Costs and Expenses  
   
  General and Administrative  
   
 General and administrative costs for the 2016 Period were $4,101,731 compared to $3,087,819 during the 2015 Period, an increase of $1,013,912 or 33%. A significant portion of this increase is the increase in payroll, as well as $206,000 for the warrant surrender incurred in the quarter ending July 31, 2016. 
   
  Depreciation and Amortization  
   
 Depreciation and amortization costs for the 2016 Period decreased to $290,055 from $291,717 for the 2015 Period, a decrease of $1,662 or 1%.  
   
  Other Income (Expense)  
   
 Other income for the 2016 Period decreased to $1,364 from $6,663 in the 2015 Period, a decrease of $5,299 or 80%. Interest expense increased to $89,411 from $67,365, an increase of $22,046 or 33%, the increase primarily to higher interest paid for the third party line of credit.  
   
  Income Taxes  
   
 Income taxes expense (benefit) for the 2016 Period and 2015 Period was $0 as Aspen Group experienced operating losses in both periods. As management made a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets stemming from these losses, there was no tax benefit recorded in the statement of operations in both periods. 

22 

Net Loss  
   
 Net loss for the 2016 Period was ($388,907) as compared to ($1,463,126) for the 2015 Period, a decrease in the loss of $1,074,219, or approximately 73%. Contributing to this lower loss was the increase in revenues and gross profits in the 2016 Period, as well as lower proportional increase in G A expenses relative to the increase in revenues.  
   
  Non-GAAP   Financial Measures  
   
 The following discussion and analysis includes both financial measures in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplemental to, and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, operating income, and cash flow from operating activities, liquidity or any other financial measures. They may not be indicative of the historical operating results of Aspen Group nor are they intended to be predictive of potential future results. Investors should not consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
   
 Our management uses and relies on Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that both management and shareholders benefit from referring to the following non-GAAP financial measures in planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparison. Our management recognizes that the non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations because of the described excluded items. 
   
 Aspen Group defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings (or loss) from continuing operations before the items in the table below including non-recurring and other charges of $97,384. Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of our operating performance because it allows management, investors and analysts to evaluate and assess our core operating results from period-to-period after removing the impact of items of a non-operational nature that affect comparability. 
   
 We have included a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that providing the non-GAAP financial measures, together with the reconciliation to GAAP, helps investors make comparisons between Aspen Group and other companies. In making any comparisons to other companies, investors need to be aware that companies use different non-GAAP measures to evaluate their financial performance. Investors should pay close attention to the specific definition being used and to the reconciliation between such measure and the corresponding GAAP measure provided by each company under applicable SEC rules. 
   
 The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net loss allocable to common shareholders, a GAAP financial measure:

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
   
 A summary of our cash flows is as follows: 

Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities  
   
 Net cash provided in operating activities during the 2016 Period totaled $26,323 and resulted primarily by non-cash items of $692,905 and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $277,674, reduced by the net loss of $388,907. The most significant item change operating assets and liabilities was an increase in accounts receivable of $1,304,754 which is primarily attributed to the growth in revenues from students paying through the monthly payment plan.  The most significant non-cash items were depreciation and amortization expense of $290,055 and the warrant buyback expense of $206,000. 
   
 Net cash used in operating activities during the 2015 Period totaled ($878,508) and resulted primarily from a net loss from continuing operations of ($1,463,126) offset by non-cash items of $573,491 and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $11,127 Depreciation and amortization of $291,716 was the most significant non-cash change and an increase of $594,794 in accounts receivable was the most significant change in operating assets and liabilities. 
   
  Net Cash Used in Investing Activities  
   
 Net cash used in investing activities during the 2016 Period totaled ($389,040) mostly attributed to the increase in software. 
   
 Net cash used in investing activities during the 2015 Period totaled ($277,653) and resulted primarily from capitalized technology expenditures included in property and equipment. 
   
  Net Cash Provided By Financing Activities  
   
 Net cash used by financing activities during the 2016 Period totaled $286,300 which reflects the increase due to the new $3,000,000 line of credit, of which $750,000 has been drawn, offset by the buyback of warrants for $400,000. 
   
 Net cash provided by financing activities during the 2015 Period totaled $5,115 which resulted primarily from a net increase in the line of credit at our bank. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resource Considerations  
   
 Historically, our primary source of liquidity is cash receipts from tuition and the issuances of debt and equity securities. The primary uses of cash are payroll related expenses, professional expenses and instructional and marketing expenses. 
   
 As of December 12, 2016, the Company had a cash balance of approximately $1.0 million. With the additional cash from the Company s $3 million line of credit, the growth in the Company revenues and improving operating margins, the Company believes that it has sufficient cash to allow the Company to implement its long-term business plan and meet its operations for at least the next 12 months. During the next 12 months, we expect to double our monthly marketing spend rate from $180,000 to $360,000, and spend $500,000 to enhance our computer systems to support our planned growth. 
   
 Our cash balances are kept liquid to support our growing infrastructure needs. The majority of our cash is concentrated in large financial institutions.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
   
 In response to financial reporting release FR-60, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies, from the SEC, we have selected our more subjective accounting estimation processes for purposes of explaining the methodology used in calculating the estimate, in addition to the inherent uncertainties pertaining to the estimate and the possible effects on our financial condition. The accounting estimates are discussed below and involve certain assumptions that, if incorrect, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. 
   
  Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue  
   
 Revenue consisting primarily of tuition and fees derived from courses taught by Aspen online as well as from related educational resources that Aspen provides to its students, such as access to our online materials and learning management system. Tuition revenue is recognized pro-rata over the applicable period of instruction. Aspen maintains an institutional tuition refund policy, which provides for all or a portion of tuition to be refunded if a student withdraws during stated refund periods. Certain states in which students reside impose separate, mandatory refund policies, which override Aspen s policy to the extent in conflict. If a student withdraws at a time when a portion or none of the tuition is refundable, then in accordance with its revenue recognition policy, Aspen recognizes as revenue the tuition that was not refunded. Since Aspen recognizes revenue pro-rata over the term of the course and because, under its institutional refund policy, the amount subject to refund is never greater than the amount of the revenue that has been deferred, under Aspen s accounting policies revenue is not recognized with respect to amounts that could potentially be refunded. Aspen s educational programs have starting and ending dates that differ from its fiscal quarters. Therefore, at the end of each fiscal quarter, a portion of revenue from these programs is not yet earned and is therefore deferred. Aspen also charges students annual fees for library, technology and other services, which are recognized over the related service period. Deferred revenue represents the amount of tuition, fees, and other student payments received in excess of the portion recognized as revenue and it is included in current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Other revenue may be recognized as sales occur or services are performed. 
   
  Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable  
   
 All students are required to select both a primary and secondary payment option with respect to amounts due to Aspen for tuition, fees and other expenses. The most common payment option for Aspen s students is personal funds or payment made on their behalf by an employer. In instances where a student selects financial aid as the primary payment option, he or she often selects personal cash as the secondary option. If a student who has selected financial aid as his or her primary payment option withdraws prior to the end of a course but after the date that Aspen s institutional refund period has expired, the student will have incurred the obligation to pay the full cost of the course. If the withdrawal occurs before the date at which the student has earned 100% of his or her financial aid, Aspen will have to return all or a portion of the Title IV funds to the DOE and the student will owe Aspen all amounts incurred that are in excess of the amount of financial aid that the student earned and that Aspen is entitled to retain. In this case, Aspen must collect the receivable using the student s second payment option. 
   
 For accounts receivable from students, Aspen records an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability, failure or refusal of its students to make required payments, which includes the recovery of financial aid funds advanced to a student for amounts in excess of the student s cost of tuition and related fees. Aspen determines the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts using a general reserve method based on an analysis of its historical bad debt experience, current economic trends, and the aging of the accounts receivable and student status. Aspen applies reserves to its receivables based upon an estimate of the risk presented by the age of the receivables and student status. Aspen writes off accounts receivable balances at the time the balances are deemed uncollectible. Aspen continues to reflect accounts receivable with an offsetting allowance as long as management believes there is a reasonable possibility of collection. 
   
 For accounts receivable from primary payers other than students, Aspen estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating specific accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations, such as bankruptcy proceedings and receivable amounts outstanding for an extended period beyond contractual terms. In these cases, Aspen uses assumptions and judgment, based on the best available facts and circumstances, to record a specific allowance for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected. These specific allowances are re-evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received. The amounts calculated are analyzed to determine the total amount of the allowance. Aspen may also record a general allowance as necessary. 
   
 Direct write-offs are taken in the period when Aspen has exhausted its efforts to collect overdue and unpaid receivables or otherwise evaluate other circumstances that indicate that Aspen should abandon such efforts.
