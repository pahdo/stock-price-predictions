CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes
a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance.
Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like: believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and
similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on
these forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements include those that address activities, developments or
events that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future.  All statements other than statements of historical
facts contained in this Quarterly report, including statements regarding our future financial position, business strategy, budgets,
projected costs and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements.  These
statements reflect the current views of management with respect to future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other
factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results, to be materially different from those
described in the forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include those set forth under the captions   Risk
Factors   beginning on page 30,   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  
beginning on page 4, and elsewhere in this Quarterly report. We undertake no obligation to update or revise our forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  We advise you to carefully review the
reports and documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ), particularly
our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our Current Reports on Form 8-K. 

As used in this Quarterly report, the terms
 we,   us,   our,   5BARz  and the  Company  mean 5BARz International Inc. and
its subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated. All dollar amounts in this Quarterly report are expressed in U.S. dollars, unless
otherwise indicated. 

The disclosures set forth in this report should
be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto of the Company for the year ended December
31, 2015. Because of the nature of a relatively new and growing company, the reported results will not necessarily reflect
the operating results that will be achieved in the future.

Note 1   Organization and Going Concern  

The Company was incorporated under the laws
of the State of Nevada on November 14, 2008. The Company was originally named  Bio-Stuff  and was a designated shell
corporation from inception to the date of acquisition of the 5BARz assets. 

In 2010 the Company changed its name to 5BARz
International, Inc. and the Company acquired a set of agreements for a 50% interest in certain intellectual property underlying
the 5BARz  RF products, and marketing rights. The 5BARz initial products are highly engineered wireless units referred to
as  cellular network extenders . The 5BARz  device captures cell signal and provides a smart amplification and
resend of that cell signal giving the user improved cellular reception in their home, office or while mobile. During the quarter,
the Company developed an advanced Wifi product entitled the 5BARz Fuji Broadband Router. The initial deployment of this product
was announced August 31, 2016, through a strategic alliance agreement with a top internet service provider in India. 

On March 29, 2012, 5BARz International, Inc.
acquired a 60% controlling interest in CelLynx Group, Inc. (the founder of the 5BARz technology) and a 60% interest in the intellectual
property underlying the 5BARz  products. On January 12, 2015 the Company incorporated two new subsidiaries, 5BARz International
SA de CV (99%) in Mexico, and 5BARz India Private Limited (99.9%) in India. On March 7, 2016 the Company incorporated a wholly
owned subsidiary 5BARz Technology Holdings, Inc. (100%) in the State of Nevada and on May 26, 2016 the Company incorporated a wholly
owned subsidiary, 5BARz Pte. Ltd. (100%) in Singapore. 

These financial statements reflect the financial
position for the Company and its subsidiary companies, CelLynx Group Inc. (60%) and its wholly owned subsidiary CelLynx Inc. (100%),
5BARz International SA de CV (99%), 5BARz India Private Limited (99.9%), 5BARz Technology Holdings, Inc. (100%), and 5BARz Pte.
Ltd. (100%). Results of operations for subsidiary Companies are reflected only from the date of acquisition or formation of that
subsidiary for the period indicated in the respective statement. 

Going concern   

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities
in the normal course of business. The Company has commenced the commercial sale of product at limited production volumes. The Company
incurred losses of $3,538,456 and $5,319,659 during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively. Cash used in operating
activities was $2,455,791 and $1,855,745 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively. The Company is seeking additional
sources of equity or debt financing, and there is no assurance these activities will be successful. These factors raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern and the Company s continued existence is dependent
upon adequate additional financing being raised to develop its sales and marketing program for the sales of 5BARz product, to expand
the Company s product base and commence its planned operations. 

Management s assessment of the significant
mitigating factors includes several quantitative and qualitative conditions which support the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern as follows;

Continued ability to generate proceeds from private placements    since inception of the business in 2008, the Company has financed operations through private placements and debt, with increased volumes in the recent years. The Company s gross proceeds from private placements and debt for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $2,437,000 compared to $2,226,720 in 2015. The Company paid for services and settled debt by the issue of shares in the amount of $1,286,929 during the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $445,161 in 2015. The Company s subsidiary 5BARz India Private Limited is working closely with Axis Capital in India, an investment bank that placed approximately $10.5 Billion USD in investment in the region since January 2015. Axis Capital in India is focused upon the financing of the Company through the sale of up to 20% of the equity securities of the subsidiary operations in India. This investment banking relationship has developed substantially as a result of the acceleration of opportunities for the Company in India. However, there is no assurance that this financing arrangement will be accomplished.  

Product Commercialization    The
        Company became an approved vendor and received several purchase orders for Cellular Network Extenders from two Tier 1 cellular
        network operators in India. The magnitude of these orders are expanding rapidly in the current year. In addition the Company s
        business with one of the Tier 1, cellular network operators has expanded to include a strategic alliance agreement with their broadband
        operator to deploy up to 5 million 5BARz wi-fi routers as a part of an expansion of broadband to the home program in the region.
        These opportunities and expansion of products by the Company represent significant steps forward in the Company s commercialization
        process and ability to generate cash flows from operations. Management expects the earnings from this new product and strategic
        alliance will represent a significant contribution to working capital and profitability for the Company.   However, there is no assurance that this profitability will be accomplished. 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of asset-carrying amounts or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that may result, should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Basis of presentation   

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information
and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information
and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation
have been included. Operating results for the six months ended June 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results that
may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. 

For further information, refer to the consolidated
financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on April 27, 2016 for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of 5BARz International Inc., and its subsidiary companies CelLynx Group Inc. (60%) and its wholly
owned subsidiary CelLynx Inc. (100%), 5BARz International SA de CV (99%), 5BARz India Private Limited (99.9%), 5BARz Pte. Inc.
(100%), and 5BARz Technology Holdings Inc. (100%). Results of operations for subsidiary Companies are reflected only from the date
of acquisition of that subsidiary, for the period indicated in the respective statements. All intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.

The Company started revenue-generating operations
in the last quarter of 2015, however these activities are in early stages and still do not generate positive cash flows from operations,
so the Company is dependent on debt and equity funding to finance its operations, and it is considered to be a development stage
company. The Company s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including failing to secure additional
funding to commercialize the Company s current technology and opportunities. 

In June 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued new guidance that removed all incremental financial reporting requirements from generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States for development stage entities. The Company early adopted this new guidance effective June 30, 2014, as a
result of which all inception-to-date financial information and disclosures have been removed from this report. 

Use of estimates   

The preparation of these financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant
estimates include impairment analysis for long lived assets, income taxes, litigation and valuation of derivative instruments.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Research and Development Costs   

Research and development costs are charged
to expense as incurred. The costs of materials and equipment that are acquired or constructed for research and development activities,
and have alternative future uses (either in research and development, marketing or production), are classified as property and
equipment and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. 

Furniture   equipment   

Furniture and equipment is recorded at historical
cost and is depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.  The useful life and depreciation
method are reviewed periodically to ensure that the depreciation method and period are consistent with the anticipated pattern
of future economic benefits. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred while renewals and
betterments are capitalized. Gains and losses on disposals are included in the results of operations. The furniture and equipment
is being depreciated over their estimated useful life of three to seven years. 

Inventory   

Inventories are carried at the lower of cost
and net realizable value. Cost is determined using the weighted-average method. As of June 30, 2016 the Company s inventory
in Mexico included 967 units of Road Warrior cellular network extenders valued at $128,999 net of a reserve of $34,208. In the
US and India the Company held an inventory of $36,563 comprised of sub-assemblies and finished goods inventories of cellular network
extenders. The Company s inventory reserve of $34,208 is provided for slow moving or potentially obsolete items in Mexico,
and is charged to cost of sales.

Note 2   Summary of significant accounting policies - continued  

Goodwill and other intangible assets   

The Company accounts for goodwill and intangible
assets in accordance with the accounting guidance which requires that goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives be tested
for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of an asset has decreased
below its carrying value. The Accounting Standards Codification ( Codification ) requires that goodwill be tested for
impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment). Application of the goodwill
impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting
units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value. Significant judgment is required to estimate the
fair value of reporting units which includes estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions.
Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment.    

When testing goodwill for impairment, the Company
may assess qualitative factors for some or all of its reporting units to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is,
a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill.
Alternatively, the Company may bypass this qualitative assessment for some or all of our reporting units and perform a detailed
quantitative test of impairment (step 1). If the Company performs the detailed quantitative impairment test and the carrying amount
of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company would perform an analysis (step 2) to measure such impairment. In accordance
with the Codification, the Company reviews the carrying value of its intangibles and other long-lived assets for impairment at
least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of long-lived assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset or asset group to the undiscounted
cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If the undiscounted cash flows of such assets are less than the
carrying amount, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group,
if any, exceeds its fair market value. 

Long-Lived Assets Subject to Amortization   

The Company amortizes
intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews them for impairment annually or whenever impairment
exists. The Company continually evaluates whether events or changes in circumstances might indicate that the remaining estimated
useful life of long-lived assets may warrant revision, or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable. When factors indicate
that long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, the Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash
flows in measuring whether the long-lived asset should be written down to fair value. Measurement of the amount of impairment would
be based on generally accepted valuation methodologies, as deemed appropriate. The intangible assets are being amortized over their
estimated useful life of seven to ten years.        

There were no long-lived assets impairment
charges recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Revenue recognition   

The Company's revenue recognition policies
are in compliance with ASC Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition.   Revenue is recognized at the date of shipment
to customers, and when the price is fixed or determinable, the delivery is completed, no other significant obligations of the Company
exist and collectability is reasonably assured.

Foreign currency translation   

Transactions in foreign currencies have been
translated into US dollars using the current rate method. The functional currency of the Company s subsidiary 5BARz International
SA de CV, in Mexico is the local currency, the Mexican Peso, and the functional currency in the Company s subsidiary 5BARz
India Private Limited is the functional currency in India, the Indian Rupee. The functional currency in the Company s subsidiary
5BARz Pte Inc. in Singapore is the Singapore Dollar. Assets and liabilities are translated based in the exchange rates at the balance
sheet date, while revenue and expense accounts are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the year. Equity
accounts are translated at historical exchange rates. The resulting translated gain and loss adjustments are accumulated as a component
of stockholders  equity and other comprehensive income. 

Concentrations   

 The Company maintains cash with major financial
institutions. Cash held in US bank institutions is currently insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC )
up to $250,000 at each institution. No similar insurance or guarantee exists for cash held in Mexico, Singapore or Indian bank
accounts. There were aggregate uninsured cash balances of $11,886 and $13,634 at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

   Comprehensive Income (Loss)   

Comprehensive income is defined as the change
in equity of a business during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owners sources. It includes
all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. The guidance
requires other comprehensive income (loss) to include foreign currency translation adjustments. 

Foreign Operations   

The following summarizes key financial metrics
associated with the Company s foreign operations (these financial metrics are immaterial for the Company s operations
in the Switzerland):

Fair value of financial instruments   

 The carrying amounts of cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities, approximate fair value due
to the short-term nature of these instruments. 

 Fair value is defined as an exit
price, representing the amount that would be received upon the sale of an asset or payment to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants. Fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that
market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. A three-tier fair value hierarchy is used to prioritize the inputs
in measuring fair value as follows: 

Level 1. 
     Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  

Level 2. 
     Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly.  

Level 3. 
     Significant unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by market data.

Note 2   Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)  

The assets or liability s fair value
measurement within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The following table provides a summary of the assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 

The following table sets forth a summary of
the changes in the fair value of the Company s Level 3 financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring
basis for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and the 12 months ended December 31, 2015: 

The derivative conversion feature liabilities
are measured at fair value using the Black-Scholes pricing model and are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.
The significant assumptions and valuation methods that the Company used to determine fair value and the change in fair value of
the Company s derivative financial instruments are provided below:

and losses for assets within the Level 3 category presented in the tables above may include changes in fair value that were attributable
to both observable (e.g., changes in market interest rates) and unobservable (e.g., changes in historical company data) inputs.

Financial assets are considered Level 3 when
their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one
significant model assumption or input is unobservable.  

Level 3 financial liabilities consist of the
derivative liabilities for which there is no current market such that the determination of fair value requires significant judgment
or estimation. Changes in fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are analyzed each period
based on changes in estimates or assumptions and recorded as appropriate. 

As of June 30, 2016 there were no transfers
in or out of Level 3 from other levels in the fair value hierarchy. 

Derivative instruments   

Derivative Financial Instruments The fair value
of an embedded conversion option that is convertible into a variable amount of shares and warrants that include price protection
reset provision features are deemed to be  down-round protection  and, therefore, do not meet the scope exception for
treatment as a derivative under ASC 815  Derivatives and Hedging , since  down-round protection  is not
an input into the calculation of the fair value of the conversion option and warrants and cannot be considered  indexed to
the Company s own stock  which is a requirement for the scope exception as outlined under ASC 815. The accounting treatment
of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record the embedded conversion option and warrants at their fair
values as of the inception date of the agreement and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. Any change in fair
value is recorded as non-operating, non-cash income or expense for each reporting period at each balance sheet date. The Company
reassesses the classification of its derivative instruments at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result
of events during the period, the contract is reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification.  

If the Company were to enter into a financial
arrangement through the issuance of convertible debt and or warrants, for which such instruments would contain a variable conversion
feature with an indeterminable number of shares, the Company would apply a sequencing policy in accordance with ASC 815- 40-35-12
whereby such instruments, and all future issuances of financial instruments regardless of conversion terms, would be classified
as a derivative liability with the exception of instruments related to share-based compensation issued to employees or directors.
The Company may also apply sequencing in any circumstance, whereby the Company has entered into financial arrangements for commitments
to issue shares, for which such issuances would exceed the authorized share limit. Upon the issuance of any such instrument, the
excess shares committed to be issued, would also be reclassified as a derivative liability. 

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was
used to estimate the fair value of the warrants and conversion options. The model includes subjective input assumptions that can
materially affect the fair value estimates. The Company determined the fair value of the Binomial Lattice Model and the Black-Scholes
Valuation Model to be materially the same. The expected volatility is estimated based on the most recent historical period of time
equal to the weighted average life of the warrants or conversion options. Conversion options are recorded as debt discount and
are amortized as interest expense over the life of the underlying debt instrument.

Note 2   Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)   

Amortization of Debt Discount   

The Company issued various debt with warrants
for which total proceeds were allocated to individual instruments based on the relative fair value of the each instrument at the
time of issuance. The value of the debt was recorded as discount on debt and amortized over the term of the respective debt. 

Stock Based Compensation   

The Company records stock-based compensation
in accordance with ASC Topic 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation.  ASC 718 requires companies to measure
compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation at fair value at the grant date and recognize the expense over the employee s
requisite service period. Under ASC 718, the Company s volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company s
stock or the expected volatility of similar companies. The expected life assumption is primarily based on historical exercise patterns
and employee post-vesting termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the
U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. 

The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model which was developed for use in estimating the fair value of options. Option-pricing models require the input of highly complex
and subjective variables including the expected life of options granted and the Company s expected stock price volatility
over a period equal to or greater than the expected life of the options. Because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially
affect the estimated value of the Company s employee stock options, it is management s opinion that the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of the Company s employee stock options.  

Although the fair value of employee stock options
is determined in accordance with ASC 718 using an option-pricing model, that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed
in a willing buyer/seller market transaction. 

For non-employees, the fair value of the award
is generally re-measured on financial reporting dates and vesting dates until the service period is complete. The fair value amount
is then recognized over the period the services are required to be provided in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. 

The Company incurred stock based compensation
charges during the six month period ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 as follows;

Net loss per share   

The Company reports loss per share in accordance
with the ASC Topic 260,  Earnings Per Share. , which requires presentation of basic and diluted EPS on the face of
the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator
of the basic EPS computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted EPS computation.  In the accompanying financial
statements, basic earnings per share of common stock is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares
of common stock outstanding during the period plus the issuance of common shares, if dilutive, that could result from the exercise
of outstanding stock options and warrants and conversion of notes payable. These potentially dilutive securities outstanding at
June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 respectively of 208,858,974 and 155,670,170 were not included in the calculation of loss per
common share, because their effect would be anti-dilutive. The weighted average number of shares outstanding does not include reciprocal
shareholdings, held by the Company s subsidiary, CelLynx Group, Inc. which is reflected as a reduction in capital in excess
of par value on the Company s balance sheet.   

The Company will not have sufficient Common
shares available to issue should all of the above conversions and exercises occur. 

The Company applies sequencing with respect
to such commitments and other circumstances as disclosed in its accounting policies for derivatives. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,
   Inventory: Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory   , that requires inventory not measured using either the
last in, first out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable
value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable cost of completion, disposal
and transportation. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods
within those fiscal years, and will be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The Company currently uses lower of
cost or net realizable value. 

The FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic
842). ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from operating leases. A lessee should
recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset
representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is
permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities.
In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented
using a modified retrospective approach. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018,
including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted for all public business entities. The Company
has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this standard on the Company s consolidated financial position and results
of operations.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

The FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation  
Stock Compensation (Topic 718). ASU 2016-09 provides improvement to employee share-based payment accounting. ASU 2016-09 involve
the simplification of several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences,
classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public business
entities the amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted
for any entity in any interim or annual period. We do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact
on our consolidated financial statements. 

The FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2016-10 provides guidance on identifying performance obligations and licensing. The core principle
of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods and services to customers in
an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and or services.
This update does not change the core principles, but rather clarify the following two aspects, identifying performance obligations
and licensing implementation guidance. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is not permitted for all public business entities. We do not anticipate
that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

FASB, the Emerging Issues Task Force and the
SEC have issued certain other accounting standards, updates, and regulations as of March 31, 2016 that will become effective in
subsequent periods; however, management does not believe that any of those updates would have significantly affected our financial
accounting measures or disclosures had they been in effect during 2016 or 2015, and it does not believe that any of those pronouncements
will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements at the time they become effective. 

Subsequent Events   

The Company evaluates events that have occurred
after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued. Based upon the evaluation, the Company did not identify
any recognized or non-recognized subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the consolidated financial
statements, except as disclosed in Note 16.

  In December 2012, a shareholder purchased 1,600,000 common shares for $80,000. On January
17, 2013, the security was amended to a convertible debenture with an 8% per annum yield and may be converted into common stock,
at the option of the holder, 90 days after the inception of the agreement, at a price which is a 20% discount to market, but not
less than $0.05 per share.  During the period from issuance of the convertible debenture issuance to June 30, 2016, interest
of $25,609 was accrued on the convertible debenture, resulting in a total principal and interest due at June 30, 2016 of $105,609. A
derivative liability at June 30, 2016 of $6,335 (2015 - $24,861) is accrued in these financial statements in connection with this
note.  

b)      
  On January 8, 2013 the Company entered into a convertible debenture agreement with a consultant
in settlement of $147,428 payable to that consultant for services rendered. The convertible debenture yields interest at 8% per
annum and may be converted into common stock, at the option of the holder, 90 days after the inception of the agreement, at a price
which is a 20% discount to market, but not less than $0.05 per share.  During the six months ended June 30, 2016 interest
of $1,740 (2015 - $1,516) was accrued on the convertible debenture. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, $24,000 in past
due consulting fees were added to the principal of the note. The total principal and interest due under the note at June 30, 2016
amount of $84,244 (2015 - $81,977). In addition, the Company reflected a derivative liability at June 30, 2016 of $3,673 (2015
- $20,494) in connection with this note.  

c)         On
October 6, 2014 the Company entered into a Note and Warrant purchase agreement with three parties who have agreed to loan up to
$1,500,000 pursuant to the terms of a convertible promissory note and warrant agreement. On the closing date, October 6, 2014 the
Company received $250,000 cash. The purchasers have agreed that at any time on or before the earlier of (i) the Purchasers 
election, or (ii) the execution of an engagement letter by and between the Company and an Investment Banking Firm acceptable to
the purchaser relating to the provision of financial advisory services by the Investment Banking Firm to the Company, that the
Company will sell Notes representing the balance of the authorized principal amount not sold at the Closing to the Purchasers.
The convertible note accrues interest at a rate of 1% per annum and provides for the conversion of the principal and accrued interest
on the note into common stock at any time, at the election of the holder at a price of $0.15 per share. Further, the number of
warrants to be issued will be equal to the proceeds loaned pursuant to the note and warrant purchase agreement divided by $0.15.
The warrant has a term of five (5) years and provides a strike price of $0.20 per share. The fair value of warrants at the date
of issue was $282,767 using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The convertible promissory note and accrued interest at December 31,
2015 was $253,123, net of an unamortized debt discount of $111,630, resulting in a carrying value of $141,493. By June 30, 2016,
total interest of $4,403 was accrued to bring the total principal and interest balance to $254,403, net of an unamortized debt
discount of $55,785, resulting in a carrying value of $198,617.

  On March 6, 2015 the Company entered into a Note and Warrant adjustment purchase agreement
with two parties who have agreed to loan $400,000 pursuant to the terms of a convertible promissory note and warrant adjustment
agreement. On the closing date, March 6, 2015 the Company received $400,000 cash. On September 6, 2015, the loan maturity was
extended for an additional 6 months in return for the accrual of a 10%, extension fee. The convertible note accrues interest at
a rate of 15% semiannually and provides for the conversion of the principal and accrued interest on the note into common stock
at any time, at the election of the holder at a price of $0.05 per share. Further, warrants to acquire up to 12,441,667 shares
which had been issued in conjunction with previous financings from the note holders at strike prices ranging from $0.20 to $0.30
per share were re-priced to a strike price of $0.05 per share with the maturity dates changed to March 6, 2017. The Company has
the right to repay the loan by payment of the principal and accrued interest at the date of repayment. On March 6, 2016 the Company
settled the aggregate principal and interest amount of $575,000, by conversion into 11,500,000 shares of common stock, issued
at a price of $0.05 per share. The amount due pursuant to this note at June 30, 2016 is nil.  

e)          On
May 6, 2015 the Company entered into a convertible note arrangement with an investment Company, in the principal amount
of $250,000 of which $100,000 was advanced to the Company at the inception of the note. The Company agreed to pay
an  original issue discount  in an amount up to 10% of the loan amount, or $10,000. The interest rate on the note
is 12%, with 6% being charged on the Issuance Date to the Original Principal Amount in the amount of $6,600 and the remaining
6% being charged to the Original Principal Amount on the 61th calendar day after the issuance date provided the note has
not been paid in full. The loan may be repaid at any time during the first 120 days of the note term. The note is convertible
into common stock of the issuer at the lesser of $0.09 or a discount to market of 50%, with the market defined as the lowest
trade price for a period of 25 days prior to the conversion, with a conversion floor price at no lower than $0.001. On
November 3, 2015 an amending agreement was entered into providing for the prepayment of the note at any time up to 9 months
from the loan origination date at a rate of 145% of the then unpaid principal and interest due under the note. On November 6,
2015 the Company issued 200,000 shares pursuant to a notice of conversion of a convertible note at a price of $0.041 per
share, for the conversion of $8,200. On November 22, 2015 the Company became delinquent on its filing requirements with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, triggering a default of the note. Upon the Event of Default, the outstanding balance was
increased to 120%. The note is payable on demand. On January 20, 2016, the Company entered into a settlement agreement on the

12   Asset Acquisition Agreement   

  On
March 29, 2012, the Company and CelLynx Group Inc. entered into an agreement which provided several amendments to the agreement
referred to above. As a result of those amendments, the following arrangements between the Companies were established;     

i.                5BARz International, Inc. acquired a 60% interest in the patents and trademarks held by CelLynx Group Inc., referred to as the  5BARz   technology. That interest in the technology was acquired for proceeds comprised of 9,000,000 shares of the common stock of the Company, valued at the date of acquisition at $0.20 per share or $1,800,000 USD. The acquisition agreement also clarified that the ownership interest in the intellectual property does represent that proportionate interest in income earned from the intellectual property.   

ii.                The Company had agreed to make available to CelLynx Group, Inc a revolving line of credit facility as amended in the amount of $2.2 million dollars on October 5, 2010. Pursuant to this revolving line of credit facility, which was scheduled to expire on October 5, 2013, the Company advanced $2,394,643 to the date of expiry. At September 30, 2013 the Company agreed to extend the term of the line of credit facility to CelLynx Group, Inc., for the lesser of one year, or the time that CelLynx Group, Inc. becomes self sustaining from royalty income. Under the amended terms of the line of credit facility, the Company has the right to convert amounts due under the facility into common stock of CelLynx, at a conversion rate which is calculated at 51% of the average lowest three closing bid prices of the CelLynx Group, Inc. common stock for a period which is ten (10) days prior to the date of conversion. This conversion rate was established previously by other parties that have funded CelLynx, and is being matched by 5BARz. At June 30, 2016, the Company holds 1,489,745,971 shares of the capital stock of CelLynx Group, Inc. and has a balance of $3,235,849 principle and interest due under the line of credit facility from Cellynx Group, Inc.

iii.                Pursuant to the Master Global Marketing and Distribution agreement between 5BARz International, Inc. and CelLynx Group, Inc., the registrant was obligated to pay to CelLynx Group, Inc. a royalty fee amounting to 50% of the Company s Net Earnings, from products or license arrangements related to the 5BARz  technology, in a ratio equal to the CelLynx proportionate interest in the underlying technology. Subsequent to the acquisition by 5BARz of a 60% interest in the intellectual property from Cellynx, that Royalty was reduced to an effective Royalty amount of 20% of net earnings from products or license arrangements related to the 5BARz technology. That fee would be paid on a quarterly basis, payable in cash or immediately available funds and shall be due and payable not later than 45 days following the end of each calendar quarter of the year. The asset acquisition agreement amendment referred to herein specified that the royalties would be paid in relation to the ownership of the intellectual property. In addition, as a result of the acquisition of a 60% interest in CelLynx Group, Inc. by the registrant, this royalty item is an intercompany transaction which in the future will be eliminated upon consolidation in financial reporting of the consolidated financial results of 5BARz International Inc. and subsidiaries.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  

Plan of Operations  

Business   

5BARz
International Inc. ( 5BARz  or the  Company ) is a leading wireless Company which has designed and patented
a line of cellular network infrastructure devices for use in the office, home and mobile market places. The Companies
products incorporate multiple patented technologies to create a highly engineered, single-piece, plug  n play device
that strengthens weak cellular signals to deliver high quality signals for voice, data and video reception on cell phones and other
cellular equipped devices. The 5BARz        solution represents
a critical solution for cellular network carriers in providing a clear, reliable, high quality signal for their subscribers with
a growing need for high quality connectivity, especially as relates to the use of data on mobile devices. The Company s products
are engineered to incorporate a great number of features more fully addressed herein.  

 The Company is in the process of developing the global commercialization
of the cellular network product enhancements to facilitate the expansion through cellular network operators, with each sector of
integration to be managed in geographic areas. The initial business focus is currently in India, with formative steps taken in
Latin America, the U.S., Africa and Western European market sectors. 

In recent months, the Company has diversified it s product
offering, having developed a  Fuji WIFI Router  which is duly approved and certified by CE, and TEC certification in
India. That product and those comprised in the  5BARz Broadband Experience Roadmap  are the basis of a recently announced
Strategic Alliance Agreement, between 5BARz, and leading Companies in the region involved in the broadband and cellular network
business. Pursuant to the terms of that agreement, the Companies are committed to deploy not less than 5 Million units of the 5BARz
product to subscribers in India over a period of 5 years commencing on the execution date of this agreement. The Strategic alliance
also contemplates the delivery of other products and accessories, which may include connected sensors, connected home automation
devices, connected cameras, headsets, VoIP phones etc. 

We were incorporated in Nevada on November
17, 2008 and the Company has offices in the States of Nevada, California and Florida as well as subsidiary operations in Mexico
and India. The address of the Company s Innovation Center in San Diego is 9444 Waples Street, Suite 140, San Diego, California,
92121, in Nevada at 9670 Gateway Drive, 2 nd  floor, Reno Nevada, 89521 and in Florida at 1111 Brickell Ave. 11 th 
Floor, Miami, Florida, 33131. Our centralized telephone number is 877-723-7255. Our web site is www.5BARz.com. Through a link on
the Investor Relations section of our website, we make available the following filings as soon as reasonably possible after they
are electronically filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC): our Annual Report on Form 10K, Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports filed pursuant to Section 13 (a) or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act. All such filings are available free of charge. The information posted on our web site is not necessarily incorporated into
this report. 

During the recent quarter, the focus of the Company has been multi
faceted;

In India, our subsidiary Company,
working in conjunction with our team of contract engineers in India and the US, and have been active working with some of the
largest cellular network operators in the region, delivering product in response to increasing volume purchase orders received
from those cellular network operators. The Companies are focused upon the integration of those products into the cellular network
operators portfolio of solutions for the improvement of their network. The near term objective is to expand the manufacturing
capability of the Company and supply of products to those cellular network operators and integrate the 5BARz   
products into their supply chain. Participating cellular network operators can expect vastly improved connectivity for their subscribers
in the region. The more significant improvements that subscribers will experience are (i) significantly improved upload and download
times for data transmission, (ii) clearer voice communication with fewer dropped calls (iii) a reduction in radio frequency emissions
at the handset utilized by the subscriber and (iv) improved battery life on the handset, to mention a few.  

During the recent quarter, the Company has manufactured and delivered
product based upon initial purchase orders received from two of the largest cellular network operators in India for units that
are specifically channelized for operation on each operator s network. The Company has received very positive feedback on
the operation of these units in India. Testing has indicated data rate improvements up to 100%, elimination of dropped calls and
an elimination of buffering for audio/video reception. Based upon these deliveries, in addition to several other purchase orders
in increasing quantities, one cellular network operator has issued a  Network Hardware and Software Ordering Document ,
commencing June 1, 2016, and effective for two years, which provides the parameters for orders to be shipped to that operator,
during that period. 

The Companies involvement with these cellular
network operators, and the 5BARz proven capability in the industry have resulted in the expansion of opportunities for the Company.
The Company delivered a  Fuji WIFI Broadband Router  in response to an opportunity to participate in the rapid expansion
of broadband to the home throughout India, As a result on August 25, 2016 the Company entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement
with a Tier 1 cellular network operator in the region, along with a major broadband operator in the region to provide a minimum
of 5 Million of the 5BARz broadband routers to clients of the Company s strategic partners. 

The Company is continuing the process of expanding the features
included, and improving the functionality of the cellular extenders, making the value proposition of the units vastly more significant
than was originally envisioned. Having developed these products the Company is setting it s sights on several other geographic
areas in which to integrate it s products. 

It should be noted that the product designed for the market in India
is designed in a configuration that is functional to provide services to 91 Countries globally, with an aggregate subscriber base
of 2.98 billion subscribers comprising some of the most significant wireless markets in the world. Further sales orders are underway
with a planned on-boarding of product to integrate the Companies products, into the supply chain of our customer. In addition,
sales and marketing efforts with other cellular network operators in India are progressing with product deliveries expected to
expand substantially in the balance of 2016. 

In the US, the Companies innovation center in San Diego has been
focused upon the logistics required to meet the needs of the marketplace in India as well as the transition of product manufacturing
from the US to India for that marketplace. In addition, the Engineering teams in San Diego and India have continued the development
of new product enhancements which will improve the products flexibility with respect to operational characteristics for various
other global markets, including the US. Cellular networks throughout the world are comprised of variable configurations, using
2G, 3G and 4G LTE technologies, operating on variable bands and frequencies. New technology being integrated into the Companies
products will serve to accelerate the Company s ability to customize product for specific market needs in various geographic
areas and cellular network configurations. In addition, technological developments are being completed to enhance the  mobile 
product first introduced in 2010 by the Company, improving the functional and simplicity of use of that product.

In Mexico, the inventory of Road Warriors have been presented to
retail operators in the region and the Company has received expressions of interest from them to carry the product. However, that
commitment is associated with a requirement for the funding of sales and marketing programs in the region by the Company, and the
related working capital requirements for inventory. The Company has made the strategic decision to focus resources on the more
significant activity in India at this time, and to commence the retail program in Mexico and Latin America, subsequent to the launch
in India. 

Strategy and focus areas   

Our focus is on three foundational priorities; 

Leadership in our core business, maintaining the highest standards in developing highly engineered devices to manage connectivity in the vicinity of the user.  

Effective collaboration with cellular network operators to ensure that our products fully meet their needs in providing their subscriber base with a portfolio of state of the art solutions for maintaining excellence in connectivity.  

Architectural design creation, to facilitate the effective integration of the Companies product into new and innovative applications, to maintain operators control over that system and to expand product lines for use in automobiles, computers and numerous other areas of application.  

The Company is uniquely positioned to take advantage of recent
market transitions. As more and more users are migrating to the use of cellular equipped devices for communication, internet access,
navigation and even entertainment, consumer demand for clear and consistent cellular signal has never been more important. In our
opinion, this evolution driven by mobile device proliferation is in early stages. 5BARz is uniquely positioned to meet this growing
demand with their developing line of product. 

The Company s recently
introduced, highly evolved innovative, carrier grade device, incorporates technologies and a combination of functionality which
represents the most advanced product developed in this market, to date. This next generation cellular network extender, branded
as 5BARz      incorporates patented technology to create
a highly engineered, single-piece, plug  n play unit that strengthens weak cellular signals to deliver higher quality signal
for voice, data and video reception on cell phones, and other cellular equipped devices.  

Products   

The 5BARz Cellular Network Extender   was unveiled at
the Mobile World Congress   in Barcelona, Spain, March 2014. Since that time the product has undergone significant product
field testing in international locations and improvements, resulting in a product which is ready for deployment. 

6 

This product supports 2G   3G technologies for cellular
devices, and has been designed in configurations which operate on either a single frequency or multiple frequencies. The technology
has successfully integrated both send and receive antennae into the single device, and hosts an abundance of features which have
never before been integrated into a single portable cellular device. 

The Company s initial product,  the Road Warrior ,
won the prestigious 2010 innovation of the year award at CES (the largest consumer electronics show in the world) for achievements
in product design and engineering. The  Road Warrior , has passed FCC Certification, and has been produced in limited quantities
to date by a contract manufacturer in the Philippines. 5BARz current technological developments have eclipsed the original Road
Warriors produced. 

Management at 5BARz are confident that this new cellular device
will alleviate much of the frustration experienced by users globally, associated with weak or compromised cellular signal. This
technology facilitates cellular usage in areas where structures, create  cellular shadows  or weak spots within metropolitan
areas, and highly congested areas such as freeways, and also serves to amplify cellular signal as users move away from cellular
towers in urban areas.  The market potential of the technology is far reaching. 

The market opportunity for the 5BARz  technology represents
nearly 7 billion cell phone subscribers worldwide serviced by 900 cellular network operators. These cellular network operators
represent the Company s primary point of entry to the Global marketplace. 

The 5BARz business opportunity to bring this state of the art technology
to market represents a significant step forward in the deployment of micro-cell technology in the industry. 

Company History   Corporate Development   

5BARz was incorporated on November 17, 2008, is a Nevada
Corporation and was a designated shell Company until 2010. In 2010 the Company acquired the  Master Global Marketing and
Distribution Rights  for the marketing and distribution of 5BARz  products throughout the world from CelLynx Inc.,
a California based Company. In addition to the acquisition of the marketing and distribution rights, the Company acquired a 60%
interest in the underlying intellectual property comprising the 5BARz  products, and holds a security interest over the balance
of those assets. 

 On March 27, 2012, 5BARz acquired a 60% controlling
interest in CelLynx Group Inc. and its consolidated subsidiary CelLynx Inc. Cellynx was the original developer of the core technology
underlying the 5BARz business. 

 On January 12, 2015, 5BARz International, Inc. incorporated
another subsidiary Company, 5BARz International, SA DE CV in Mexico. The Company is a 99% owned subsidiary of 5BARz International,
Inc. with the remaining 1% owned by Daniel Bland, the CEO of 5BARz International, Inc. The Company has obtained the necessary product
approvals for the sale of the 5BARz Road Warrior product in Mexico, and has imported a limited inventory of product for resale
in the Country. 

 On January 12, 2015, 5BARz India Private Limited was
incorporated in India, a 99.9% subsidiary of 5BARz International, Inc. During the quarter under review, the Company shipped orders
to two, Tier one cellular network operators in the region, and are organizing for a ramp up of production and sales volumes. 

 On May 26, 2016, the Company incorporated a subsidiary
5BARz PTE. Ltd. in Singapore, which is wholly owned by 5BARz International Inc.   

7 

During 2012 and 2013, the Company presented the first version
of our product, the  Road Warrior  to Cellular Network operators in order to establish market recognition and interest
in the product globally. Having established expressions of interest in the product, in June 2013 the Company entered into a collaboration
agreement with a leading cellular network operator. Through that arrangement, we established a product development program to deliver
a product, designed with our partners input that meets their requirements, in order to integrate the product into their portfolio
of solutions for network improvement. 

 In November 2013, 5BARz set up an Innovation Center in San
Diego California, staffed by a talented engineering team and in addition established significant outsourced engineering and fabrication
talent internationally. As a result, a state of the art product was developed working with our collaborative partners. The Company
is very pleased with the quality of product provided with feature sets that meet and exceed those originally envisioned in our
collaboration plan. The Company is equally pleased with the future development programs being developed, which significantly expands
the horizons of the Company s product line and our value proposition to the wireless industry. 

 As the Company s newest products commence limited production,
for distribution and testing by potential partners in locations around the world, our focus moves to the development of high volume
manufacturing to meet global demand. Our manufacturing partner Flextronics represents an industry leader in the design, manufacturing,
distribution and aftermarket support of electronic products. Flextronics operates through a network of facilities in more than
30 countries with a global workforce of 200,000. The association with Flextronics is a significant factor in establishing speed

The Market Opportunity   

 The market opportunity for the 5BARz 
technology represents nearly 7 billion cell phone subscribers worldwide and is growing as a result of the following factors;  

Dead zones, weak signals, and dropped calls are the biggest problems in the industry. Now, by adding internet and video, the quality issue is increasing exponentially.  

76% of cellular subscribers use their mobile phone as the primary phone  

More consumers are using mobile phones for web browsing, up and down- loading photos, videos and music  

More mobile phones are operating at higher frequencies which have less ability to penetrate buildings  

Weak signals make internet applications inaccessible and slow and increase the drain on cell phone batteries.  

Forty percent of all mobile phone users report inadequate service in their homes or office and we estimate that 60% of the 6.8 billion mobile phone users worldwide consider continuous connectivity to be very important.  

Consumer demand for quality in the cell
phone user experience is becoming an increasingly important factor. The 5BARz  technology meets this need. 5BARz is currently
developing relationships with Cellular network operators internationally to integrate the 5BARz  product into cellular networks
globally. 

The recently developed expansion of product by introduction
of the 5BARz WIFI Router has facilitated the Company s participation into a rapidly growing opportunity for broadband connectivity
in the home in India. Currently 30% of homes in the region have Broadband connectivity. That percentage is expected to expand considerably
in the region for a few reasons. First, the cost of connectivity is decreasing and in addition new apps exist which facilitate
voice recognition and translation of commands. Any person in any language can now access the worldwide web. The opportunity, envisions
the expansion of services beyond router connectivity. The 5BARz roadmap envisions expansion of product into the internet of things
technologies and big data management services and sales.

Why Poor Signals Exist   

A variety of factors may cause dropped
calls and dead zones, including congestion, radio signal interference, tower hand-off, and lack of coverage. Despite continued
infrastructure investment by operators, and antenna technology improvements by base station providers and mobile phone makers,
these problems will continue for the foreseeable future. This is because many of the contributing factors can't be controlled by
the operators and manufacturers. To understand how innovative 5BARz  products are in improving phone signals, it's first important
to understand the causes of poor signal quality. 

Congestion  

In 1999, sales of mobile phones surpassed
combined sales of personal computers and automobiles. By 2010, mobile phones had replaced land-line phones in 30% of U.S. households.
Smart phones, led by iPhones and Android phones, have become indispensible personal assistants. Laptop computer sales outnumber
desktop computer sales, and most laptops are equipped with cellular data chipsets or USB modems. Apple's iPad has sparked the connected
tablet market too. Vending machines, automobiles, mobile sensors, and many other devices include  machine to machine 
cellular data modules. As a result, the number of cellular voice and data devices will soon exceed the number of people on Earth. 

 If sheer numbers weren't enough, new
uses for mobile devices are causing even faster growth in bandwidth usage. Obvious uses include video entertainment, videoconferencing,
downloaded and streaming music, MMS, email, and application downloads. Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, and many other social networking
applications put further load on operator networks. Also, surprising sources of traffic have emerged, such as deliberate  miscalls .
A miscall is when one subscriber calls another, but hangs up before the receiving party answers. Since operators don't charge for
these uncompleted calls, subscribers are using miscalls as a free way to communicate. In India, orders for milk are made this way.
In Syria, five miscalls in a row signals the recipient to  go online  to the Internet and chat. In Bangladesh, it's estimated
that up to 70% of traffic at peak times is due to miscalls. This practice isn't limited to countries with low per-capita income,
and yet it places a high load on operator networks. 

 There are sources of congestion based on location
and time, too. Transportation clusters like airports, major highway intersections, bridges, and toll road gates all bring many
people together at peak times. Also, because of home land-line replacement, many residential neighborhoods have many mobile phones
in simultaneous use in mornings and evenings. Lastly, local population growth and immigration can result in too many phones for
existing infrastructure. Due to long planning times, investment requirements, local government permits, and construction time,
it's difficult for infrastructure to keep up with the pace of change in many developing areas, especially in growth countries. 

Radio Signal Interference  

Interference comes from both obvious
and subtle causes. Certain materials aren't transparent to radio signals, especially durable materials used in buildings, large
structures, and even automobiles. As a result there are radio shadows in which a mobile phone can't sense the signal from a base
station. In addition, radio signals from adjacent channels or reflected signals can interfere with each other due to wave cancellation
effects. In some cases these forms of interference primarily attenuate the signal (make it weaker). However, interference can also
add noise, so that the ratio of signal to noise becomes too low for the mobile phone and the base station to understand each other. 

Tower Hand-Off  

Mobile phone networks are called  cellular 
networks because they are made up of overlapping areas of coverage that are provided by base stations in fixed locations. As a
mobile subscriber travels by automobile or train, he will eventually reach the limit of a base station's coverage. At that point,
his mobile phone will  hand off  to a base station for the next coverage area. If signal quality is poor due to interference,
or if the new base station is congested with too many mobile phones, the subscriber's connection may be lost. 

11 

Lack of Coverage  

Some rural or developing areas don't
have enough people or population density for operators to justify the cost of installing base stations except at wide intervals.
In these areas the signal strength from the base station or the mobile phone may be too low to create or maintain a connection.
This results in  dead zones  or dropped calls. 

Solutions to Poor Signal Quality  

 Operators know that dead zones, dropped
calls, and poor voice quality are big problems, and that re-dialing while driving can be unsafe. Operators also are concerned about
subscribers' ability to make emergency calls. They understand that people rely on mobile phones for business and connecting with
family. As mobile phones replace landlines, operators are especially aware that mobile signal quality is critical. Operators also
see that wireless data is increasingly important for personal and business use. 

 To help, operators work with phone and
base station manufacturers to improve antenna performance. They invest in new base stations in growth areas. They invest in technologies
that enable more connections per base station. Operators have even provided refunds for dropped calls. 

 However, many factors causing poor signal
quality can't be controlled by operators. Therefore products have emerged to help, provided by operators or companies who sell
to either operators or subscribers. 

Femtocells  

Operators can provide femtocells to
subscribers with poor signal quality at home. Usually the subscriber pays for hardware, installation, or a monthly fee. Femtocells
are carrier grade, and are like small base stations that communicate with operators by using the home Internet connection as a
 backhaul . In addition to backhaul the incoming call is routed thru the internet as well, which leads to the degradation
of a call when trying to access the internet as well as engaging in a call. Lastly, femtocells only work with phones from one operator,
so families with phones from multiple operators may have to request multiple femtocells. 

Repeaters  

Repeaters are usually carrier-grade equipment
and are programmed for a specific operator. They extend cellular networks into buildings and small offices. As with femtocells,
installation is complex and if not done properly they can cause network problems. Unlike femtocells, repeaters do not use the local
Internet connections, but rather receive and re-transmit the signals between base stations and mobile phones. 

Boosters  

Boosters are usually sold online and
through retail. They vary widely in amplification power, quality of amplification, and power balance. For example, these products
amplify signals at 1, 3, 5, or even 10 watts all the time. Using power over 1 watt increases the probability that a booster will
interfere with surrounding mobile devices. Also, it would be more energy efficient to adapt amplification power as needed, rather
than to simply use the same wattage constantly. Many boosters don't support balanced power in both directions between base station
and mobile phone. This may result in only solving the signal quality problem in one direction. Since communication is bi-directional,
this doesn't actually solve the problem. Varying quality of amplification also introduces noise, which can interfere with surrounding
devices. Further, in order to avoid a feedback loop, Boosters have to be separated into at least two units, a receive and send
antennae. The communication between these two units in some applications utilize wires, in others, utilize a 5Mhrtz signal which
is high frequency and does not penetrate building structure well, also subject to WiFi interference. These units are costly and
require installation effort, to sustain signal quality. The manufacturing cost is more than 2 times that of the 5BARz unit, and
they have relatively high power consumption to operate. 

12 

A New Class of Solution  

 5BARz has evaluated the causes of poor
signal quality, the needs of both operators and subscribers, and the solutions in the market. Femtocells, repeaters, and boosters
either don't solve all parts of the problem, or aren't optimal due to cost or other drawbacks. Using expertise starting with a
team of engineers who designed sophisticated base station amplifiers for operators, 5BARz has developed a new class of carrier-grade
technology. That engineering team grew to a multi-national teams of engineers working on project specific challenges integrated
into the 5BARz  products. The result is a highly engineered hybrid of repeaters and boosters, intended for use in automotive
applications, home, and office. 5BARz has tested these products in the lab, in the real world, and with operators. These products
advance the state of the art to provide the following advantages: 

  Low Power Use  

 5BARz  products only amplify when
required. The automotive products use less than 1/2 watt, while the home product uses less than 1 watt. This not only saves energy,
but also minimizes interference with other wireless devices and the network itself. In fact, new rules being proposed by the U.S.
Federal Communications Commission are expected to mandate low power standards such as 5BARz now provides. 

  Simple Setup  

 5BARz  products don't require a
technician to run wires, carefully determine proper location, or optimize orientation. No use of home Internet connection is required,
and there are no switches or settings. The unit has a simple plug and play installation requirement. 

  Balanced Amplification  

 This feature, plays a key role in ensuring
that the product does not interfere with the macro network, and is a feature covered by the Company s patented technology.
Receive and sent signals need automatic balance management in order for both directions of a communication channel to be improved.
5BARz  products are not only  smart  about adapting amplification levels, but also about balancing amplification for incoming
signals from the base station, and return signals from the mobile phone. This attribute is critical in that it ensures that the
operation of the unit automatically avoids interference with the Macro Network. This automated process is a part of the 5BARz 
patented technology. 

  Signal Stability  

 5BARz has done extensive design, testing,
and re-design to avoid a number of problems experienced by the antenna design of alternatives. For example, booster products can
experience oscillations when people, animals, or vehicles move nearby. These oscillations can weaken the booster effect or cause
interference with other wireless devices. Many booster products achieve size similar to 5BARz ' products by putting antennas
close together in the same product package, but don't optimize radio wave interactions between those antennas. This weakens the
boosters' effectiveness, and is one reason why other manufacturers compensate by using too much wattage, in turn wasting power
and increasing the probability of interfering with other radio frequency devices and the network. 

  Integrated Antennae  

 The Company has developed and patented
technology which facilitates the integration of both the receive and transmit antenna into the single device, without creating
a feedback loop. This represents a very significant technological advance permitting the unit to be a self contained plug and play
consumer electronic. 

13 

Broadband / Narrow band support  

 The Company s products can provide
amplification for bands from 5 to 60 Mhz. 

  Smart signal processing  

 The Company s product is also capable
of  interference   echo  cancellation, in addition to automatic noise suppression. As a result, the signal that
reached your cell phone is both better quality and a stronger signal. 

Self regulating intelligent power management  

The unit is designed to sense cellular signal
strength and will automatically adjust amplification to optimum levels. 

Enhanced cell phone user experience  

The 5BARz unit covers an area of some
4,000 square feet, providing a much increased voice experience and increased data throughput. In addition, the cell phone handset
can experience power savings up to 80%.

Products and Markets  

 To date the Company has introduced three products to
market incorporating the 5BARz  patented technology as follows; 

18 

Markets and marketing strategy  

The Company s primary entry point to markets is through collaborative
arrangements with Cellular Network operators. That market is comprised of nearly 7 billion cellular subscribers globally separated
by geographic region as follows; 

As provided in the diagram above, the second largest market in
the world for cellular subscribers is India with 13% of the world market. This is the Company s current and primary point
of market penetration. 

It is the intent of the Company, as adoption of the products begins
to accelerate in India, to expand their global footprint into other quickly expanding markets such as the Asia Pacific region,
Africa, the Americas and Europe.   

In addition, it is the intent of management to design future applications
of the Company s technology that will be integrated into the marketplace through the redesign of the products, working in
collaboration with Original Equipment Manufacturer s (OEM s), such as with automobile manufacturers, computer manufacturers,
mobile home manufacturers etc. 

The Company has been expanding its employee/consultant base
in India, Latin America, and South Africa due to significant product interest in those regions. Further the Company has set a structure
for the development of the German speaking market place in Europe, through a subsidiary operation 5BARz AG in Zurich Switzerland.

The Wireless Market in India  

With a subscriber base of more than 905 million by March 2014,
the Mobile telecommunications system in India is the second largest in the world and has been available to private operators since
the 1990s. GSM is comfortably maintaining its position as the dominant mobile technology with 80% of the mobile subscriber market.
The mobile market is operated by the following cellular network operators; 

20 

The Wireless Market in India   continued  

On the global stage, India saw the fastest
growth in new mobile-phone connections with 18 million net additions in the third quarter of 2014, according to a report by Swedish
mobile network equipment maker Ericsson. The number of smartphones, which account for just 37 per cent of all mobile-phone subscriptions,
is growing at 15 per cent compounded annual growth rate, and will cross 6,100 million by 2020. The falling cost of handsets, coupled
with improved usability and increasing network coverage, are factors that are making mobile technology a popular phenomenon in
the country. 

In December 2014, 5BARz introduced a number
of prototype units for use in India, to the Company s consulting engineering team working in the country for field trials,
and then to the R D department of a select cellular network operator working in the Country. It is the objective of 5BARz to
manufacture and distribute the products, working in conjunction with cellular network operators in the country. 

The following factors are considered to
be particularly relevant with respect to the need for the 5BARz products in India. 

In India the monthly churn rate for subscribers is 6% (BMI India Telecommunications Report, 2Q 2012, pp. 49-51). To provide to a cellular network operator a distinct competitive advantage, such as that provided by the 5BARz cellular network extender, could result in a substantive migration of customers to that network operator, and a reduction in churn.  

As provided above, congestion is a prominent issue resulting in the degradation of cellular connectivity. India is the second most populated region in the world, and so the need for the 5BARz technology is most acute.  

Mobile and Wireless Telecommunications issued a report, August 2013 which highlight a number of favorable factors being experienced in the wireless industry in India, which is positive for 5BARz entry into that market as follows;  

o  
     The government has recently permitted Foreign Direct Investment in the telecom sector  

o  
     The industry has moved toward a more friendly regulatory environment  

o  
     Burgeoning data usage, has created the need for improved connectivity   

o 
     Customer s happiness   A vital cornerstone of any service is the customer. His satisfaction is a direct indicator of running a good business. And this is primarily the service providers  responsibility. 5BARz is offering to service providers improved connectivity for their customers.  

The LATAM Market  

The Company has analyzed the fundamentals of the mobile phone market
in the LATAM countries and has determined that to be a key point for market penetration for the 5BARz  products for the following
reasons; 

First, the mobile phone market has just gone through a very
strong decade of growth in Latin America, with mobile subscriptions having overtaken fixed lines as the preferred method of communication.
As a result Latin America's mobile telephone industry has a high degree of market penetration. Mobile subscriptions totaled 88.2%
of the region's population, compared to 55.2% in Asia Pacific, 90.4% in North America and 50.6% in the Middle East and Africa.
Having recently invested heavily in subscription development, the cellular network operators are now focusing upon the maintenance
of their substantial customer base, and the 5BARz  technology can contribute substantially to achieving that customer satisfaction. 

21 

The mobile telephone industry in Latin America has benefited
from generally opening up to competition. This provides a very fertile ground for the introduction of a technology such as 5BARz 
to secure customer retention through quality of service. 

 The inherent geographical difficulties in laying fixed line
infrastructure have encouraged a move to mobiles, but in addition, that geography, the Andean and Rainforest regions and expanses
of rural areas again benefit from the 5BARz  technology whereby weak cellular signal is amplified within the vicinity of
the user. 

 Further the LATAM countries are experiencing a renewed era of strong
growth, reflecting reviving economic growth and improving income levels. This again is a favorable factor for the introduction
of our products to meet the growing demands of consumers. 

In addition, the launch of 3G and mobile broadband services
has increased demand for mobile subscriptions. Mobile broadband is particularly desirable in areas with no or limited access to
cable internet services. Moving to mobiles offers consumers the benefits of on-the-move communications and advantageous introductory
deals. Greater access to communications also helps to narrow regional divides. All of these factors are enhanced by the 5BARz 
experience. 

 Internet usage is expanding since 2010, with broadband internet
subscriptions generally growing by higher rates than mobile subscriptions 

Initial 3G market expansion is likely to be greater in the
region's wealthier markets, such as Argentina, Chile and Mexico, and these have been specifically targeted by our Company. Latam
subscribers are; 

Brazil: 271 million    

Mexico: 92.9 million    

Argentina: 56.7 million    

Colombia: 49.1 million    

Venezuela: 27.9 million    

Chile: 21 million    

Other countries: 103 million    

Total: 621 million    

In 2014, the Company imported 1,000 Road Warrior units into the
Region and obtained necessary approval for the sale of those units in Mexico. In January 2015, the Company incorporated a subsidiary
company in Mexico to commence sales of that product. The R D team are currently working on several new and innovative products
that will fit the needs of the Region.

Results
of Operations    

Three-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to three-month
period ended June 30, 2015.   

The three months ended June 30, 2016 reflects a net loss of
$3,403,316, representing a decrease in the loss of $144,850 compared to the corresponding three-month period loss of
$3,548,166 for the period ended June 30, 2015. The largest components of this decrease are bank charges and interest of
$80,857 other expenses of $530,349 incurred during the quarter in 2016 which is comprised of a decrease in interest expense
and the amortization of debt discount related to convertible notes that were settled during the quarter ended June 30, 2016.
In addition, other expenses include an expense of $1,037,049 for the change in the fair value of derivative liabilities and a
gain on the settlement of debt of $534,623 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. 

The general and administrative costs increased from the three
months ended June 30, 2015 to the three
months ended June 30, 2016 by $683,230. The largest component of this increase was an increase of stock based
compensation from $59,158 in the three
months ended June 30, 2015 to $776,783 in the three
months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $716,625. The stock based compensation in 2016 arose
from the issuance of warrants to the CEO and Chairman of the Board during the quarter ended June 30, 2016. 

In addition, research and development expenses in the three
months ended June 30, 2015 were greater
than the three
months ended June 30, 2016 by $147,826. This decrease is accounted for by a reduction in research and development expenses and an increase in sales
and marketing expenses as the Company shifts focus to the deployment of network extenders and routers throughout India. The additional
decrease in R D expenses is comprised of a reduction of engineering consulting (inside engineering consulting) during the quarter
from $355,048 in 2015 to $278,910 in the three
months ended June 30, 2016 a decrease of $76,138. Further, supplies expense decreased from 2014 to 2015 to make
up the difference. 

The Company s net loss during the three-month period ended
June 30, 2016 was $3,403,316 or $0.01 per share compared to a loss of $3,548,166 or $0.02 per share during the three months ended
June 30, 2015. The weighted average number of shares outstanding was 342,972,127 for the three-month period ended June 30, 2016, compared to 213,839,578 shares for the three month period ended June 30, 2015. 

23 

Six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to six-month
period ended June 30, 2015.   

The six months ended June 30, 2016 reflects a net loss of $3,538,456
representing a decrease in the loss of $1,781,203 compared to the corresponding six-month period loss of $5,319,659 for the period
ended June 30, 2015. 

The decrease in amortization and depreciation expense is the result
of the elimination of a capital lease that included testing equipment that was utilized with the research and development team
based in San Diego, CA. 

The bank charges and interest decreased in the six
months ended June 30, 2016 by $172,116 compared with the six
months ended June 30, 2015. This
decrease in interest amount is related to the settlement of convertible notes with common stock of $1,018,981 and cash payments
of $94,812 during the six months ended June 30, 2016. 

The general and administrative costs increased during the six months
ended June 30, 2015 to the six
months ended June 30, 2016 by $386,139. The largest component of this increase was an increase of stock based compensation from
$83,408 in the six
months ended June 30, 2015 to $811,416 in the six
months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $728,008. The stock based compensation in the six
months ended June 30, 2016 arose from the issuance of warrants
to key employees and consultants ratified by the Board of Directors during the quarter ended June 30, 2016. 

In addition, research and development expenses in the six
months ended June 30, 2015 were less
than the six
months ended June 30, 2016 by $84,087. This increase in R D expenses is comprised of an increase of engineering services (outside engineering
consulting) during the six months ended June 30, 2016 from $521,827 in 2015 to $617,427 in 2016 an increase of $95,600. Further,
supplies expense increased from 2015 to 2016 from $43,223 to $91,172, an increase of $47,949. 

The Company s net loss during the six-month period ended June
30, 2016 was $3,538,456 or $0.01 per share compared to a net loss of $5,319,659 or $0.02 per share during the six months ended
June 30, 2015. The weighted average number of shares outstanding was 321,589,557 for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared
to 213,839,578 for six-month period ended June 30, 2015. 

The Company s financial statements have been prepared assuming
that the Company will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and
realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. 

The company will require additional
capital to meet its  long term operating requirements. The Company expects to continue to raise additional capital through
a multi-faceted strategy to include the further sale of equity securities, sales of equity securities by subsidiary Companies,
debt and factoring facilities as the Company s sales progress.

Liquidity and Capital Resources    

As at June 30, 2016   

As at June 30, 2016, the reporting issuer s current assets
were $444,553 and current liabilities were $10,258,412, which results in a working capital deficit of $9,813,859. The Company s
working capital deficit at December 31, 2015 was $9,166,914. This represents an increase in the Company s working capital
deficit of $646,945 or a 7% increase in the current year. The increase is comprised of two components. The Company has made a significant
push during the six months ended June 30, 2016 in establishing production capability in order to deliver cellular network extender
product, to Cellular Network operators in India. In addition the Company has developed and marketed a new WIFI product for the
diversification of their business to participate in the expansion of broadband throughout India in homes and offices. This resulted
in an increase in short term unpaid product development expenses and consulting fees of $1,284,904 over the balance at December
31, 2015. 

As at June 30, 2016, the Company s total assets were $4,298,594
comprised of intellectual property in the amount of $2,512,656 and goodwill in the amount of $1,140,246. The intellectual property
represents the technology, patents and patent applications and trademark registrations and license related to the 5BARz technology
by the combined entity. 

As at June 30, 2016, the Company s total liabilities were
$10, 258,412, comprised of current liabilities of $10,258,412 as described above. The increase in liabilities as at June 30, 2016
from year ended December 31, 2015 is related to an increase in accounts payable of $342,125. This increase is mostly attributable
to the Company s contract engineering and development supplier in India , which has incurred an increase in accounts payable
of $289,719 during the six month period to June 30, 2016. Further, the derivative liabilities have increased to $3,185,293 on June
30, 2016 from $1,868,439 at December 31, 2015. This increase of $1,316,854 is attributable to the requirement to calculate the
valuation of issued options and warrants, and reflect that derivative liability as a potential liability, should the Company be
unable to issue shares should holders exercise those derivatives. It is management s assessment that this is an unlikely
possibility. The Company s notes payable have decreased from $2,883,264 to $1,733,776 at June 30, 2016 reflecting the Companies
focused effort to settle these notes as quickly as possible due to the high cost of this debt. 

Stockholders  deficit increased from a  balance
at December 31, 2015 of $5,129,116 to a  balance of $5,959,818 at June 30, 2016. This increase of $830,702 is attributable
in the most part to sales of common stock during the six months ended June 30, 2016 of $2,437,000 being offset
by a loss during the period of $3,531,865. 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities   

For the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, net cash flows used
in operating activities was $2,455,791 consisting primarily of cash used for product development and administrative expenses. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities   

For the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, net cash flows used
in investing activities was $89,147 comprised of additional patent expenditures of $3,915 as well as $85,232 of equipment expenditures. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities   

The Company has financed operations through the issuance of
equity securities. The sale of equity securities of $2,437,000 were issued during the six months ended June 30, 2016. For the
six-month period ended June 30, 2016, net cash flows provided from financing activities was $2,342,188 compared to $1,953,482
in the corresponding period of the prior year. This difference is the result of an increase in the sales of equity
securities of $1,592,280 over the prior year. This increase is offset by debt securities of $1,382,000 issued in
the prior year, which have not occurred at all in 2016. The market for the Company s stock has limited liquidity and as a result pricing is relatively
volatile. 

25 

Plan of Operation and Funding   

The Company has entered into a series of private placements over
the past several years to finance operations. Existing working capital, further sales of debt and equity securities, funding through
the sale of equity securities from subsidiary operations and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations
over the next twelve months. We have no bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the
proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt and an increase in liabilities due from individuals and businesses that work
with the Company. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital
expenditures relating to: (i) development and marketing of our product; and (ii) working capital. We intend to finance these expenses
with further issuances of securities. As the market for product commences in India the Company is working on the development of
a $20 million dollar equity sale in the India operations through an investment bank in India. Further, should the Company s
market for securities exceed $0.30 per share, the Company has 97.8 million warrants in the hands of existing stockholders. Consideration
is being given to filing an S1 registration statement to qualify those warrants to provide for a financing facility for the Company
through the exercise of those securities. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues
to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution
to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock.
Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available
on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly
and materially restrict our business operations. 

Material Commitments   

On January 11, 2011, the Company assumed a
material commitment to CelLynx Group, Inc. to make available under the terms of a line of credit agreement $2.2 million dollars,
expiring October 5, 2013. On September 30, 2013 the Company agreed to extend the funding of CelLynx Group, Inc. under the terms
of an amended Line of Credit Agreement. At the date of the extension of the line of credit agreement, the balance due to 5BARz
International, Inc. was $2,503,764. This is a subsidiary Company, and this funding will be paid when proceeds are available. The
commitment to fund and debts provided under the line of credit agreement mature in the lesser of one year or when CelLynx earns
sufficient royalty income to become self-sustaining. The line of credit agreement matured on September 30, 2014. The balance due
to 5BARz International, Inc., by its subsidiary Company, Cellynx Group, Inc., under the line of credit agreement, principle and
interest on June 30, 2016 was $3,867,605. This amount is eliminated on consolidation of the subsidiary in the Financial Statements
of the combined entity. 

On July 24, 2013
the Company entered into a lease agreement in San Diego for facilities, which commenced on October 1, 2013.   
  In May 2014 the Company entered into a further commitment to expand the Companies leased facilities
in San Diego for a period of 66 months. As a result, at June 30, 2016, the future minimum lease payments for the existing and expanded
facilities will be $1,090,165.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance
sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in
financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are
material to investors. 

26 

Going Concern   

In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015, our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph in its report relating to our financial statements
for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, which states that we have incurred negative cash flows from operations since inception,
and expect to incur additional losses in the future and have a substantial accumulated deficit. These conditions give rise to substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to expand operations and generate additional revenue and our
ability to obtain additional funding will determine our ability to continue as a going concern. Our condensed consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

We have prepared our financial statements
assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities
in the normal course of business.     

Recent accounting pronouncements   

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,
   Inventory: Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory   , that requires inventory not measured using either the
last in, first out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable
value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable cost of completion, disposal
and transportation. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods
within those fiscal years, and will be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The Company currently uses lower of
cost or net realizable value. 

The FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic
842). ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from operating leases. A lessee should
recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset
representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is
permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities.
In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented
using a modified retrospective approach. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018,
including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted for all public business entities. The Company
has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this standard on the Company s consolidated financial position and results
of operations. 

The FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation  
Stock Compensation (Topic 718). ASU 2016-09 provides improvement to employee share-based payment accounting. ASU 2016-09 involve
the simplification of several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences,
classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public business
entities the amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning in December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted
for any entity in any interim or annual period. We do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact
on our consolidated financial statements. 

The FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2016-10 provides guidance on identifying performance obligations and licensing. The core principle
of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods and services to customers in
an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and or services.
This update does not change the core principles, but rather clarify the following two aspects, identifying performance obligations
and licensing implementation guidance. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is not permitted for all public business entities. We do not anticipate
that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

FASB, the Emerging Issues Task Force and the
SEC have issued certain other accounting standards, updates, and regulations as of March 31, 2016 that will become effective in
subsequent periods; however, management does not believe that any of those updates would have significantly affected our financial
accounting measures or disclosures had they been in effect during 2016 or 2015, and it does not believe that any of those pronouncements
will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements at the time they become effective. 

27 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   

Our Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section discusses our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of the financial statements requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these
estimates.   

Goodwill and other intangible assets   

The Company accounts for goodwill and intangible
assets in accordance with the accounting guidance which requires that goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives be tested
for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of an asset has decreased
below its carrying value. The Accounting Standards Codification ( Codification ) requires that goodwill be tested for
impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment). Application of the goodwill
impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting
units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value. Significant judgment is required to estimate the
fair value of reporting units which includes estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions.
Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment. 

When testing goodwill for impairment,
the Company may assess qualitative factors for some or all of its reporting units to determine whether it is more likely than not
(that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including
goodwill. Alternatively, the Company may bypass this qualitative assessment for some or all of our reporting units and perform
a detailed quantitative test of impairment (step 1). If the Company performs the detailed quantitative impairment test and the
carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company would perform an analysis (step 2) to measure such impairment.
In accordance with the Codification, the Company reviews the carrying value of its intangibles and other long-lived assets for
impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset or asset group to
the undiscounted cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If the undiscounted cash flows of such assets
are less than the carrying amount, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the
asset or asset group, if any, exceeds its fair market value. No impairment was deemed to exist as of March 31, 2016 and 2015. 

Long-Lived Assets Subject to Amortization   

The Company amortizes intangible assets with
finite lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews them for impairment annually or whenever an impairment exists. The Company
continually evaluates whether events or changes in circumstances might indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of long-lived
assets may warrant revision, or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable. When factors indicate that long-lived assets
should be evaluated for possible impairment, the Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows in measuring whether
the long-lived asset should be written down to fair value. Measurement of the amount of impairment would be based on generally
accepted valuation methodologies, as deemed appropriate. There were no long-lived assets impairment charges recorded during the
six months ended June 30, 2016 and  December 31, 2015. 

Revenue recognition   

The Company's revenue recognition policies
are in compliance with ASC Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition.   Revenue is recognized at the date of shipment
to customers, and when the price is fixed or determinable, the delivery is completed, no other significant obligations of the Company
exist and collectability is reasonably assured. 

28 

Foreign currency translation   

Transactions in foreign currencies have been
translated into US dollars using the current rate method. The functional currency of the Company s former subsidiary 5BARz
AG, is its local currency (Swiss Franc   CHF). The functional currency of the Company s subsidiary 5BARz International
SA de CV, in Mexico is the local currency, the Mexican Peso, and the functional currency in the Company s subsidiary 5BARz
India Private Limited is the functional currency in India, the Indian Rupee. Assets and liabilities are translated based in the
exchange rates at the balance sheet date, while revenue and expense accounts are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing
during the year. Equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates. The resulting translated gain and loss adjustments
are accumulated as a component of stakeholders  equity and other comprehensive income. 

Derivative Instruments   

Derivative Financial Instruments The
fair value of an embedded conversion option that is convertible into a variable amount of shares and warrants that include price
protection reset provision features are deemed to be  down-round protection  and, therefore, do not meet the scope
exception for treatment as a derivative under ASC 815  Derivatives and Hedging , since  down-round protection 
is not an input into the calculation of the fair value of the conversion option and warrants and cannot be considered  indexed
to the Company s own stock  which is a requirement for the scope exception as outlined under ASC 815. The accounting
treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record the embedded conversion option and warrants at their
fair values as of the inception date of the agreement and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. Any change in
fair value is recorded as non-operating, non-cash income or expense for each reporting period at each balance sheet date. The Company
reassesses the classification of its derivative instruments at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result
of events during the period, the contract is reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification.  

If the Company were to enter into a financial
arrangement through the issuance of convertible debt and or warrants, for which such instruments would contain a variable conversion
feature with an indeterminable number of shares, the Company would apply a sequencing policy in accordance with ASC 815- 40-35-12
whereby such instruments, and all future issuances of financial instruments regardless of conversion terms, would be classified
as a derivative liability with the exception of instruments related to share-based compensation issued to employees or directors.
The Company may also apply sequencing in any circumstance, whereby the Company has entered into financial arrangements for commitments
to issue shares, for which such issuances would exceed the authorized share limit. Upon the issuance of any such instrument, the
excess shares committed to be issued, would also be reclassified as a derivative liability. 

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was
used to estimate the fair value of the warrants and conversion options. The model includes subjective input assumptions that can
materially affect the fair value estimates. The Company determined the fair value of the Binomial Lattice Model and the Black-Scholes
Valuation Model to be materially the same. The expected volatility is estimated based on the most recent historical period of time
equal to the weighted average life of the warrants or conversion options. Conversion options are recorded as debt discount and
are amortized as interest expense over the life of the underlying debt instrument. 

29 

ITEM 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk.  

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices
and interest rates. We do not have substantial operations at this time so they are not susceptible to these market risks.  If,
however, they begin to generate substantial revenue, their operations will be materially impacted by interest rates and market
prices. 

ITEM 4.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   

Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our
disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), as of June 30, 2016. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer
and principal financial officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act, including this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s
rules and forms and that our disclosure and controls are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in
the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal
executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 

A control system, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. The design
of any system of controls also is based in part on certain assumptions regarding the likelihood of certain events, and there can
no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Given these and
other inherent limitations of control systems, these are only reasonable assurance that our controls will succeed in achieving
their stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

Management of the Company is responsible for
establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange
Act. The Company s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s
management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements in accordance
with United State s generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP), including those policies and procedures that: (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the company, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with US GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements. 

30 

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Management s assessment included an evaluation of the
design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting.  Based on this assessment, Management concluded the Company did not maintain effective
internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 

An internal control material weakness is a significant deficiency,
or aggregation of deficiencies, that does not reduce to a relatively low level the risk that material misstatements in financial
statements will be prevented or detected on a timely basis by employees in the normal course of their work. An internal control
significant deficiency, or aggregation of deficiencies, is one that could result in a misstatement of the financial statements
that is more than consequential. 

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal
control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, and this assessment identified the following material weaknesses in the company s
internal control over financial reporting: 

A system of internal controls (including policies and procedures) has neither been designed nor implemented.  

A formal, internal accounting system has not been implemented.  

Segregation of duties in the handling of cash, cash receipts, and cash disbursements is not formalized.  

Therefore, we have relied heavily on entity or management review
controls to lessen the issue of segregation of duties. 

This quarterly report does not include an attestation report of
the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report
was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this Quarterly Report. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  

We know of no material, existing or pending legal proceedings against
us, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation other than those articulated below. There
are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial stockholder, is an adverse
party or has a material interest adverse to our company, other than those articulated below. 

Prior
to the Company s investment in CelLynx, on July 19, 2010 certain claims for unpaid wages were filed against CelLynx, Inc.
Judgments were obtained commencing in August 2011  for back wages by some of its former employees. 
 Some of   those claims have been partially 
 paid and others were expected   to be   paid
in the   normal course of   business 
 or   were to be otherwise   defended. 
 Those claims have now been incorporated   into California Labor Commission 
 awards in favor of   those former employees. Those 
 awards   total approximately $263,000 depending on 
 interest charges. It is the Company s intention to pay these amounts.  As of June 30, 2016, the Company has accrued
$263,000 in its financial statements. 

On May 13, 2015 the Company received a complaint

34 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS    

Need For Additional Financing   

The Company has very limited funds, and such funds may not be adequate
to take advantage of current and planned business opportunities. Even if the Company's funds prove to be sufficient to acquire
an interest in, or complete upon transactions contemplated, the Company may not have enough capital to fully develop the opportunity.
The ultimate success of the Company may depend upon its ability to raise additional capital. As additional capital is needed, there
is no assurance that funds will be available from any source or, if available, that they can be obtained on terms acceptable to
the Company. If not available, the Company's operations will be limited. 

Ability to continue as a going concern   

The Company has incurred net losses of $3,538,456 and $5,319,659
for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company has earned no revenues to date.  Consequently the Company s
future is dependent upon their ability to obtain financing and to execute upon their business plan and to create future profitable
operations for the business.  These factors raise substantial doubt that the Company will be able to continue as a going
concern. In the event that the Company cannot raise further debt or equity capital, or achieve profitable operations, the Company
may have to liquidate their business interests and investors may lose their investment. 

Lack of profitable operating history   

The Company faces all of
the risks of a new business and the special risks inherent in the investigation, acquisition, and involvement in a new business
opportunity. The Company must be regarded as a new or  start-up  venture with all of the unforeseen costs, expenses,
problems, and difficulties to which such ventures are subject, and consequently has a high risk or failure.         

   We may be subject to significant foreign currency exchange
controls in certain countries in which we operate   

Certain foreign economies have experienced
shortages in foreign currency reserves and their respective governments have adopted restrictions on the ability to transfer funds
out of the country and convert local currencies into U.S. dollars. This may increase our costs and limit our ability to convert
local currency into U.S. dollars and transfer funds out of certain countries. Any shortages or restrictions may impede our ability
to convert these currencies into U.S. dollars and to transfer funds, including for the payment of dividends or interest or principal
on our outstanding debt. In the event that any of our subsidiaries are unable to transfer funds to us due to currency restrictions,
we are responsible for any resulting shortfall. 

Our foreign operations subject us to risks that could negatively
affect our business   

Our business can be exposed to risks inherent
in foreign operations.  These risks, which can vary substantially by market, include political instability, corruption,
social and ethnic unrest, changes in economic conditions (including wage and commodity inflation, consumer spending and unemployment
levels), the regulatory environment, tax rates and laws and consumer preferences as well as changes in the laws and policies that
govern foreign investment in other countries. 

In addition, the value of our foreign assets
is affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect reported earnings.  There
can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 

Dependence upon limited Directors, management and consultants   

The Company currently has only two individuals
serving as its directors, and has few employees and consultants. The Company will be heavily dependent upon their skills, talents,
and abilities to implement its business plan, and secure additional personnel and may, from time to time, find that the inability
of the officers and directors to fully meet the needs of the business of the Company results in a delay in progress toward implementing
its business plan. 

35 

We may conduct further offerings in the future in which case
investors' shareholdings may be diluted   

Since our inception, we have relied on sales
of our common stock to fund our operations. We may conduct further equity offerings in the future to finance our current operations.
If common stock is issued in return for additional funds, the price per share could be lower than that paid by our current stockholders.  We
anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common stock in order to fund our business operations. If we issue additional
stock, investors' percentage interests in us will be diluted. The result of this could reduce the value of current investors' stock. 

Regulation of Penny Stocks   

The Company's securities are subject to a Securities
and Exchange Commission rule that imposes special sales practice requirements upon broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons
other than established customers or accredited investors. For purposes of the rule, the phrase  accredited investors 
means, in general terms, institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000, or individuals having a net worth in excess of $1,000,000
or having an annual income that exceeds $200,000 (or that, when combined with a spouse's income, exceeds $300,000). For transactions
covered by the rule, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's
written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale. Consequently, the rule may affect the ability of broker- dealers to sell
the Company's securities and also may affect the ability of purchasers in this offering to sell their securities in any market
that might develop therefore. 

In addition,
the Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted a number of rules to regulate  penny stocks.  Such rules include Rules
3a51-1, 15g-1, 15g-2, 15g-3, 15g-4, 15g-5, 15g-6, 15g-7, and 15g-9 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Because
the securities of the Company may constitute  penny stocks  within the meaning of the rules, the rules would apply to
the Company and to its securities. The rules may further affect the ability of owners of Shares to sell the securities of the Company
in any market that might develop for them.     

 Shareholders should be aware that, according
to Securities and Exchange Commission, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse.
Such patterns include (i) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter
or issuer; (ii) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases;
(iii)  boiler room  practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced
sales persons; (iv) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (v) the wholesale
dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with
the resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequent investor losses. The Company's management is aware of the
abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market. Although the Company does not expect to be in a position to dictate
the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate in the market, management will strive within the confines of practical
limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to the Company's securities. 

Our common stock is not listed on a national exchange and
as a public market develops in the future, it may be limited and highly volatile, which may generally affect any future price of
our common stock   

Our common stock currently is listed only in
the over-the-counter market on the OTCQB, which is a reporting service and not a securities exchange.  We cannot assure
investors that in the future our common stock would ever qualify for inclusion on any of the NASDAQ markets for our common stock,
The American Stock Exchange or any other national exchange or that more than a limited market will ever develop for our common
stock.  The lack of an orderly market for our common stock may negatively impact the volume of trading and market price
for our common stock.  

36 

Any future prices for our common stock will be determined in the
marketplace and may be influenced by many factors, including the following: 

the depth and liquidity of the markets for our common stock;  

investor perception of 5BARz International Inc. and the industry in which we participate;  

general economic and market conditions;  

statements or changes in opinions, ratings or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms or industry analysts relating to the market in which we do business or relating to us specifically, as has occurred in the past;  

quarterly variations in our results of operations;  

general market conditions or market conditions specific to technology industries; and  

domestic and international macroeconomic factors.  

In addition, the stock market has recently
experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations.  These fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance
of the specific companies.  As a result of the factors identified above, a stockholder (due to personal circumstances)
may be required to sell his shares of our common stock at a time when our stock price is depressed due to random fluctuations,
possibly based on factors beyond our control. 

Impracticability of Exhaustive Investigation   

The Company's limited funds
and the lack of full-time management will likely make it impracticable to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis
of its chosen business opportunity before the Company commits its capital or other resources thereto. Management decisions, therefore,
will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies, independent analysis, market surveys and the like which, if the Company
had more funds available to it, would be desirable.     

   Other Regulation   

The Company may be subject to regulation or licensing by federal,
state, or local authorities. Compliance with such regulations and licensing can be expected to be a time-consuming, expensive process
and may limit other investment opportunities of the Company. 

Failure to Perform   

The Company may be unable to comply with the
payment terms of certain agreements providing the Company with the exclusive sales marketing and distribution rights to 5BARz product.
In the event that the Company defaults on such agreements, the Company may be unable to maintain operations as a going concern. 

Competitive Technologies   

The Companies technology relates to a market
that is highly competitive and a much sought after solution by cellular networks. The Company expects to be at a disadvantage when
competing with firms that have substantially greater financial and management resources and capabilities than the Company. The
Company is subject to technological obsolescence should other technologies be developed which are superior to the Companies technology.
