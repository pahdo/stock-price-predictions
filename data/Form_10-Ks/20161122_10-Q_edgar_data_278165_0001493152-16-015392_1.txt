1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION  AND Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-     

BASIS
OF PRESENTATION AND PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION   

The interim consolidated financial statements
of Quest Solution, Inc. include the combined accounts of Quest Marketing, Inc., an Oregon Corporation, Bar Code Specialties, Inc.,
( BCS ) a California Corporation, Quest Canada, Inc., (formerly known as ViascanQdata, Inc.), ( Viascan )
a Canadian based corporation with operations in the same business line as Quest and Quest Exchange Limited, a Canadian based holding
company. Effective October 1, 2015, the financial statements of Viascan have been consolidated into the Company s consolidated
results of operations. On September 19, 2016, the Company publicly announced the decision of its Board of Directors to enter
into a Letter of Intent to sell the shares of its wholly owned subsidiary, Quest Solution Canada Inc., to Viascan Group
Inc. The operations of Quest Solution Canada Inc. have been classified as a discontinued operation and the assets and liabilities
of Quest Solution Canada Inc have been classified as held for disposal. The companies currently operate as a single business unit.
All material intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. 

The interim consolidated financial statements
included herein, presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles and stated in US dollars,
have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the  SEC ). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations,
although the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. 

These unaudited interim condensed financial
statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary
for fair presentation of the information contained therein. It is suggested that these interim financial statements be read in
conjunction with the audited financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2015 and notes thereto included
in the Company s Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 18, 2016. The Company follows the same accounting policies in the
preparation of interim reports. 

Operating
results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the
year ended December 31, 2016.  

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies   

This
summary of significant accounting policies of Quest Solution, Inc. is presented to assist in understanding the Company s
consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements and notes are representations of the Company s
management who is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of the financial statements. These accounting policies conform
to generally accepted accounting principles and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements.  

Cash   

Cash
consists of petty cash, checking, savings, and money market accounts. For the purpose of the statements of cash flows, all highly
liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. There were no cash
equivalents as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

The
Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts which, at times, may exceed federal insured limits.  

The
Company has restricted cash on deposit with a federally insured bank in the amount of $767,688 at September 30, 2016. This cash
is security and collateral for a corporate credit card agreement with a bank and for deposit against a letter of credit issued
for executive life insurance policies owned by the Company.  

USE
OF ESTIMATES   

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at
the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially
different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. The Company
evaluates its estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. The Company uses historical experience and various other assumptions
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances to form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates and
assumptions used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements.  

PURCHASE
ACCOUNTING AND BUSINESS COMBINATIONS   

The
Company accounts for its business combinations using the purchase method of accounting which requires that intangible assets be
recognized apart from goodwill if they are contractual in nature or separately identifiable. Acquisitions are measured on the
fair value of consideration exchanged and, if the consideration given is not cash, measurement is based on the fair value of the
consideration given or the fair value of the assets acquired, whichever is more reliably measurable. The excess of cost of an
acquired entity over the fair value of identifiable acquired assets and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill.  

The
valuation and allocation process relies on significant assumptions made by management. In certain situations, the allocations
of excess purchase price are based upon preliminary estimates and assumptions. Accordingly, the allocations are subject to revision
when the Company receives updated information, including appraisals and other analyses, which are completed within one year of
the acquisition. Revisions to the fair values, which may be significant, are recorded when pending information is finalized, within
one year from the acquisition date.  

ACCOUNTS
RECEIVABLE   

Accounts
receivable are carried at their estimated collectible amounts. The Company provides allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable
equal to the estimated collection losses that will be incurred in collection of all receivables. Accounts receivable are periodically
evaluated for collectability based on past credit history with customers and their current financial condition. The Company s
management determines which accounts are past due and if deemed uncollectible, the Company charges off the receivable in the period
the determination is made. The Company generally requires no collateral to secure its ordinary accounts receivable. Based on management s
evaluation, accounts receivable has a balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts of $20,249 for the period ending September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

PROPERTY
AND EQUIPMENT   

Property
and equipment are stated at purchased cost and depreciated using both straight-line and accelerated methods over estimated useful
lives ranging from 3 to 15 years. Upon disposition of property and equipment, related gains and losses are recorded in the results
of operations. Depreciation expense for period ending September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $70,802 and $92,656, respectively.
For federal income tax purposes, depreciation is computed using the modified accelerated cost recovery system. Expenditures for
major renewals and betterments that extend the useful lives of property and equipment are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance
and repairs are charged to expenses as incurred.  

INTANGIBLE
ASSETS    

Intangible
assets are stated at cost, net of accumulated amortization. The assets are being amortized on the straight-line method over useful
lives ranging from 3 to 10 years. Amortization expense for the period ending September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $1,276,275
and $2,506,167, respectively.  

Goodwill
is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment annually or when indicators of a potential impairment are present. Our impairment
testing of goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of intangibles. The annual evaluation for impairment of
goodwill and intangibles is based on valuation models that incorporate assumptions and internal projections of expected future
cash flows and operating plans. None of the goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes. For the three month period ended September
30, 2016, the goodwill in relation to the Company s investments in Viascan was impaired by $2,500,000 and for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 the goodwill impairment charge was $4,800,000 which was all included in the net loss from discontinued
operations. The impairment charge was driven by the following reasons:  

Net operating losses for the first nine months of the year   

Negative cash flow resulting in the Company funding $8.0
    million to date since the acquisition date   

Negative working capital   

Conversion of $1.8 million of notes related to the acquisition
    to Series C preferred shares at condition significantly move favorable to the Company   

Forgiveness of $0.5 million of notes related to the acquisition   

The Company s decision to dispose of the shares of Viascan
    making it a discontinued operation   

ADVERTISING  

The Company generally expenses advertising
costs as incurred. During the nine month period ending September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the Company spent $77,205 and
$150,689 on advertising (marketing, trade show and store front expense), net of co-operative rebates, respectively. 

The
Company received rebates on advertising from co-operative advertising agreements with several vendors and suppliers. These rebates
have been recorded as a reduction to the related advertising and marketing expense in the period earned.  

INVENTORY   

Substantially
all of the inventory consists of raw materials and finished goods and are valued based upon first-in first-out ( FIFO )
cost, not in excess of market. The determination of whether the carrying amount of inventory requires a write-down is based on
a detailed evaluation of inventory relative to any potential slow moving products or discontinued items as well as the market
conditions for the specific inventory items. There were no inventory reserves recorded as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, respectively.  

DEPRECIATION
AND AMORTIZATION   

Depreciation
and amortization expense primarily consists of the non-cash write-down of tangible and intangible assets over their expected economic
lives. We expect this expense to continue to grow in absolute dollars and potentially as a percentage of revenue as we continue
to grow and incur capital expenditures to improve our technological infrastructure and acquire assets through potential future
acquisitions.  

FAIR
VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   

Fair
value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal
or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement
date. Applicable accounting guidance provides a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that prioritize the use of observable
inputs over the use of unobservable inputs, when such observable inputs are available. The three levels of inputs that may be
used to measure fair value are as follows:  

Level
    1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   

Level
    2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in
    markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets), or model-driven valuations in which all
    significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated with, observable market data.   

Level
    3 - Fair value is derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable, including assumptions
    and judgments made by the Company.   

Assets
and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. The Company
reviews the fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observable inputs may result in a reclassification
of assets and liabilities within the three levels of the hierarchy outlined above.  

NET
LOSS PER COMMON SHARE   

Net loss per share is provided in accordance
with FASB ASC 260-10,  Earnings per Share . Basic net loss per common share ( EPS ) is computed by dividing
income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings
per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average shares outstanding, assuming all dilutive potential common
shares were issued, unless doing so is anti-dilutive. The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for computing basic
EPS as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 were 36,323,489 and 35,702,188, respectively. 

The fully diluted number of common stock
amounts to 50,195,563 which includes the potential of the existing senior subordinated debt holders converting their debt
into common shareholder equity at $1.00 per share (for $3,231,388 in debt) and $2.00 per share (for $274,882 in
debt) and 10,182,560 preferred Series B and C shares converting to common shares. Despite the fact the conversion is  out
of the money , accounting rules require these amounts to be included in diluted shares outstanding. Additional terms of
the debt would require the Board of Directors to consent to any debt holder converting and having a position greater than 4.99%
outstanding on the date of conversion. 

FOREIGN
CURRENCY TRANSLATION, FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AND COMPREHENSIVE LOSS   

The
functional currency of the Company s foreign subsidiaries is the local currency. Gains and losses resulting from the translation
of the foreign subsidiaries  financial statements are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reported
as a separate component of stockholders  equity. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included
in net income (loss).  

The
Company currently does not enter into financial instruments for either trading or speculative purposes. There were no forward
foreign exchange contracts used during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Total
comprehensive loss is comprised of net loss and other comprehensive earnings losses, such as foreign currency translation gains
or losses and unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale marketable securities.  

RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   

The
Company has evaluated the recent pronouncements and believes that none of them will have a material effect on the Company s
financial statements.  

NOTE
2   GOING CONCERN   

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.
The Company has acquired a significant working capital deficit and issued a substantial amount of subordinated debt in connection
with its recent acquisitions. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficit of $19,396,210 and an accumulated
deficit and accumulated other comprehensive loss of $31,110,969. The Company is dependent on the completion of working capital
financings, vendor trade credit extensions, restructuring of subordinated debt and private placement of its securities in order
to continue operations. These factors taken together raise doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

NOTE
3   CONCENTRATIONS   

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash, accounts receivable,
and accounts payable. Beginning January 1, 2015, all of our cash balances were insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
( FDIC ) up to $250,000 per depositor at each financial institution. This coverage is available at all FDIC member
institutions. The Company uses Citizens National Bank and Wells Fargo Bank, which are FDIC insured institutions. Based on these
facts, collectability of bank balances appears to be adequate.  

For the quarter ending September 30, 2016
and September 30, 2015, one customer accounted for 21% and another customer accounted for 33% of the Company s revenues,
respectively. 

Accounts receivable at September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015 are made up of trade receivables due from customers in the ordinary course of business. One customer made
up 11% and another customer 20% of the trade accounts receivable balances at September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, respectively. 

Accounts payable are made up of payables due
to vendors in the ordinary course of business at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. One vendor made up 90% and 83%,
respectively of the outstanding balance, which represented greater than 10% of accounts payable at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, respectively. 

NOTE
4   INVENTORY   

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, inventories consisted of the following:  

NOTE
5   PREPAIDS   

The
Company currently has $561,123 and $649,123 of expenses that were prepaid as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively,
which we expect to expense during the next year.  

NOTE
6   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY   

On
August 27, 2015, the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement with a former owner and current subordinated debt holder. Under
the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the Company was required to pay $7,036,000 as full satisfaction for two (2) promissory
notes by September 30, 2015. Included in this agreement (and deducted from the $7.036 million settlement) was the assignment of
license rights with an assigned value of $1.15 million. The licenses were previously acquired for $450,000 from Rampart Systems.
The assignee has agreed to pay Quest Solution a royalty fee of 3.5% of revenue related to the  gun-barrel,   rebar
inspection,  and  air frame  licenses for a five (5) year period, beginning on the effective date of the Assignment
Agreement (as defined in the Settlement Agreement). The parties agreed to exclude the existing mining distribution license from
the royalties to be paid to the Company by the assignee. On October 19, 2015, Quest Solution entered into that First Amendment
to the Omnibus Settlement Agreement, which modified the payment schedule under the Settlement Agreement.  

NOTE
7   OTHER LIABILITIES   

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, other liabilities consisted of the following:  

The
Company has key man life insurance policies to insure the Company against risk of loss of an executive.  

The
Company has a contingent liability of $150,000 in connection with the acquisition of technology licenses in 2015. This payment
becomes due when the respective technology becomes operable and viable. As of the date of this filing, it is unknown when that
will become due.  

NOTE
8   DEFERRED REVENUE   

Deferred
revenue consists of prepaid third party hardware service agreements, software maintenance service contracts and the related costs

Introduction   

Quest
Solution, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( QUES  or the  Company ), formerly named Amerigo Energy, Inc.
was incorporated in 1973. Prior to 2008, the Company was involved in various unrelated business activities. From 2008-2014, the
Company was involved in multiple businesses inclusive of an oil and gas investment company. Due to changes in market conditions,
management determined to look for acquisitions which were positive cash flow and would provide immediate shareholder value. In
January 2014, we made our first such acquisition of Quest Marketing Inc. (dba Quest Solution, Inc.).  

Quest Solution is a national mobility systems
integrator with a focus on design, delivery, deployment and support of fully integrated mobile solutions. The Company takes a consultative
approach by offering end to end solutions that include hardware, software, communications and full lifecycle management services.
The professionals simplify the integration process and deliver the solutions to our customers. Honeywell, Panasonic, AirWatch,
Wavelink, SOTI and Zebra are major suppliers which Quest Solution uses in the solutions we provide to our customers. 

In
May 2014, our Board of Directors voted to get approval from the shareholders of the Company for a name change from Amerigo Energy,
Inc. to Quest Solution, Inc. The Company received the approval from a majority of its stockholders and filed the amendment to
its Certificate of Incorporation with the State of Delaware. The name change became effective by the State of Delaware on May
30, 2014. The Company also requested a new stock symbol as a result of the name change and we assigned our new trading symbol
 QUES .  

The
Quest Solution business plan previously included developing oil and gas reserves while increasing the production rate base and
cash flow. Due to declines in production on the oil leases the Company had an interest in the Company was forced to revisit its
position in the oil industry.  

The
Company s business strategy developed into leveraging management s relationships in the business world for investments
for the Company. The Company intends on continuing with its acquisition of existing companies with revenues and positive cash
flow.  

In
November 2014, the Company acquired 100% of the shares of Bar Code Specialties, Inc. ( BCS ) located in Southern California.
BCS is a national mobility systems integrator and label manufacturer with a focus on warehouse and distribution industries. Effective
October 1, 2015, the company acquired 100% of the shares of ViascanQData ( Viascan ) located in Canada. The companies
currently operate as a single business unit. Since the combination of the three companies, the Company has been exploring efficiencies
in all facets of the businesses and learning best practices from both executive teams.  

On September 19, 2016, the Company publicly
announced the decision of its Board of Directors to enter into a Letter of Intent to sell the shares of its wholly owned
subsidiary, Quest Solution Canada Inc., to Viascan Group Inc. The operations of Quest Solution Canada Inc. have
been classified as a discontinued operation and the assets and liabilities of Quest Solution Canada Inc. have been classified
as held for disposal.

Cash
Requirements   

Our
ability to fund our growth and meet our obligations on a timely basis is dependent on our ability to match our available financial
resources to our growth strategy.  

We
have suffered recurring losses from operations. The continuation of our company is dependent upon our company attaining and maintaining
profitable operations and raising additional capital as needed. In this regard, we have raised additional capital through equity
offerings and loan transactions, and, in the short term, will seek to raise additional capital in such manners to fund our operations.
Our officers and shareholders have not made any written or oral agreement to provide us additional financing. There can be no
assurance that additional private or public financing, including debt or equity financing, will be available as needed, or, if
available, on terms favorable to us. Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and such additional equity
securities may have rights, preferences or privileges that are senior to those of our existing common or preferred stock. Furthermore,
debt financing, if available, will require payment of interest and may involve restrictive covenants that could impose limitations
on our operating flexibility.  

However,
if we are not successful in generating sufficient liquidity from operations or in raising sufficient capital resources, on terms
acceptable to us, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition,
and we will have to adjust our planned operations and development on a more limited scale.  

Inflation   

The
Company s results of operations have not been affected by inflation and management does not expect inflation to have a material
impact on its operations in the future.  

Off-
Balance Sheet Arrangements   

The
Company currently does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

EVALUATION
OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

The
Company s management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e)) as of September 30, 2016,
the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  

Based
on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted with the Securities
and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated
to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

CHANGES
IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING   

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter, i.e., the three
months ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.

b)  
      any
    fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s
