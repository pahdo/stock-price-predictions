     Table of Contents         Midwest Energy Emissions Corp. and Subsidiaries     Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements         Note 1 - Organization        Midwest Energy Emissions Corp.      Midwest Energy Emissions Corp. (the  Company") is organized under the laws of the State of Delaware with 150,000,000 authorized shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share and 2,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share.      MES, Inc.      MES, Inc. is incorporated in the State of North Dakota. MES, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Midwest Energy Emissions Corp. and is engaged in the business of developing and commercializing state of the art control technologies relating to the capture and control of mercury emissions from coal fired boilers in the United States and Canada.       Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies        Basis of Presentation      The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for interim financial information. Accordingly, these financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.      In management s opinion, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position as of September 30, 2016, and results of operations, changes in stockholders  deficit and cash flows for all periods presented. The interim results presented are not necessarily indicative of results that can be expected for a full year.       Use of Estimates      The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.      Cash and Cash Equivalents      The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments and other short-term investments with maturity of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash in three accounts with one financial institution, which at times may exceed federally insured limits.                  9       
     Table of Contents         In addition, per the financing agreement entered into with AC Midwest LLC (the  Lender ) (see Note 8), the Company is not permitted to use cash to pay interest accruing on unsecured convertible promissory notes. Also, should the Company be unable to raise sufficient capital to pay off such notes or otherwise induce the holders thereof to convert their notes to common stock, it will not be permitted to pay them off under the terms of the Financing Agreement without the prior consent of the Lender.       Accounts Receivable       Trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount the Company expects to collect. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Management considers the following factors when determining the collectability of specific customer accounts: customer credit-worthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic industry trends, and changes in customer payment terms. Past due balances over 90 days and other higher risk amounts are reviewed individually for collectability. If the financial condition of the Company s customers were to deteriorate, adversely affecting their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. Based on management s assessment, the Company provides for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance. Balances that remain outstanding after the Company has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the allowance for doubtful accounts was zero.      Inventory      Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market (net realizable value).      Property and Equipment      Property and equipment are stated at cost. When retired or otherwise disposed, the related carrying value and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and the net difference less any amount realized from disposition, is reflected in earnings. For consolidated financial statement purposes, property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of 3 to 5 years.     Expenditures for repairs and maintenance which do not materially extend the useful lives of property and equipment are charged to operations. Management periodically reviews the carrying value of its property and equipment for impairment.      Recoverability of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets      The Company has adopted ASC 360-10,  Property, Plant and Equipment  ( ASC 360-10 ). ASC 360-10 requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used by the Company be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.     Events relating to recoverability may include significant unfavorable changes in business conditions, recurring losses or a forecasted inability to achieve break-even operating results over an extended period. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets based upon forecasted undiscounted cash flows. Should impairment in value be indicated, the carrying value of the long-lived and or intangible assets would be adjusted, based on estimates of future discounted cash flows. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, as a result of recurring losses and an accumulated deficit, the Company identified a triggering event requiring a test for the recoverability of long-lived assets and intangible assets. Assessing the recoverability of long-lived assets and intangible assets requires significant judgments and estimates by management. Management concluded that the fair value of long-lived assets and intangible assets exceeded their carrying value and as such, no impairment charges were recognized for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.            A significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset, adverse change in the use or condition of a long-lived asset, adverse change in the business climate or legal or regulatory factors impacting a long-lived asset and intangible assets and continued operating losses, accumulated deficit and cash flow deficiencies among other indicators, could cause a future assessment to be performed which may result in an impairment of long-lived assets and intangible assets resulting in a material adverse effect on the financial position and results of operations of the Company.      Stock-Based Compensation      The Company accounts for stock-based compensation awards in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718,  Compensation Stock Compensation  ( ASC 718 ), which requires equity-based compensation, be reflected in the consolidated financial statements over the period of service which is typically the vesting period based on the estimated fair value of the awards.      Derivative Liabilities      The Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market or foreign currency risks; however, the Company has certain financial instruments that are embedded derivatives associated with capital raises and common stock purchase warrants. The Company evaluates all its financial instruments to determine if those contracts or any potential embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC 815-10. This accounting treatment requires that the carrying amount of any embedded derivatives be recorded at fair value at issuance and marked-to-market at each balance sheet date. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, as is the case with the Company, the change in the fair value during the period is recorded as either income or expense. Upon conversion or exercise, the derivative liability is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then the related fair value is reclassified to equity.      Fair Value of Financial Instruments      The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the inputs used to determine fair value, which are as follows:                     Level 1    Unadjusted quoted prices available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.                         Level 2    Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, or unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability.                         Level 3    Unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data and reflect the use of significant management judgment. These values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management s estimates of market participant assumptions.          The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. In instances where the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been determined based on the lowest level input significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability.      Cash and cash equivalents were the only asset measured at fair value on a recurring basis by the Company at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and is considered to be Level 1. Warrant liability is considered to be Level 3, and is the only liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.            Financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, deferred revenue, customer rebates and short-term debt. The carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximated fair value at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 due to their short-term maturities. The fair value of the convertible promissory notes payable at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 approximated the carrying amount as the notes were issued during the three years ended December 31, 2015 at interest rates prevailing in the market and interest rates have not significantly changed as of September 30, 2016. The fair value of the convertible promissory notes payable was determined on a Level 2 measurement.     The Company has entered into certain financial instruments and contracts; such as, equity financing arrangements for the issuance of common stock, which include anti-dilution arrangements and detachable stock warrants that are i) not afforded equity classification, ii) embody risks not clearly and closely related to host contracts, or iii) may be net-cash settled by the counterparty. These instruments are recorded as derivative liabilities, at fair value at the issuance date. Subsequent changes in fair value are recorded through the consolidated statements of operations.     The Company s derivative liabilities are related to detachable common stock purchase warrants ( warrants ) issued in conjunction with debt and warrants issued to the placement agents for financial instrument issuances. We estimate fair values of the warrants that do contain  Down Round Protections  utilizing valuation models and techniques that have been developed and are widely accepted that take into account the additional value inherent in  Down Round Protection.  These widely accepted techniques include  Modified Binomial ,  Monte Carlo Simulation  and the  Lattice Model.  The  core  assumptions and inputs to the  Modified Binomial  model are the same as for  Black-Scholes , such as trading volatility, remaining term to maturity, market price, strike price, and risk free rates; all Level 2 inputs. Fair value measurements are classified according to the lowest level input or value-driver that is significant to the valuation. A measurement may therefore be classified within Level 3 even though there may be significant inputs that are readily observable. However, a key input to a  Modified Binomial  model (in our case, the  Monte Carlo Simulation , for which we engaged an independent valuation firm to perform) is the probability of a future capital raise. By definition, this input assumption does not meet the requirements for Level 1 or Level 2 outlined above; therefore, the entire fair value calculation is deemed to be Level 3 under accounting requirements due to this single Level 3 assumption. This input to the Monte Carlo Simulation model was developed with significant input from management based on its knowledge of the business, current financial position and the strategic business plan with its best efforts.     As discussed above, financial liabilities are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable. For the Company, the Level 3 financial liability is the derivative liability related to the warrants that include  Down Round Protection  and they were valued using the  Monte Carlo Simulation  technique. This technique, while the majority of inputs are Level 2, necessarily incorporates various assumptions associated with a Capital Raise which are unobservable and, therefore, a Level 3 input.           The table below provides a summary of the changes in fair value of the warrant liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis:             Revenue Recognition      The Company records revenue from sales in accordance with ASC 605,  Revenue Recognition  ( ASC 605 ). The criteria for recognition are as follows:     1. Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;     2. Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered;     3. The seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and     4. Collectability is reasonably assured.     Determination of criteria (3) and (4) is based on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments is provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded.     The Company recorded customer acquisition costs totaling $188,225 through September 30, 2016 and zero during the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company entered into agreements with three new customers during this period. The capitalized balance of customer acquisition costs was $763,048 and $897,428 on September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Amortization expense for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $322,605 and $189,101 respectively.      In accordance with the terms of its customer agreements, the Company made progress billings to two customers which relate to the fabrication, delivery and installation of new equipment, which is included as deferred revenue at December 31, 2015 and was recognized as revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 when the equipment was commissioned for use by the customers.     The Company recognizes revenue for product when it is delivered to the customer location.           The Company generated revenues of $24,536,939 and $6,565,887 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company generated revenue for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 by delivering product and equipment to its commercial customers and completing demonstrations of its technologies at potential customer sites.      Income Taxes      Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets, including tax loss and credit carryforwards, and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred income tax expense represents the change during the period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current and non-current based on their characteristics. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.     The recognition, measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in an enterprise s consolidated financial statements are based on a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold. The Company recorded a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. We intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. However, given our current earnings and anticipated future earnings, we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that within the next 12 months, sufficient positive evidence will become available to allow us to reach a conclusion that a portion of the valuation allowance will no longer be needed. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. The exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on the basis of the level of profitability that we are able to actually achieve. When necessary, the Company would accrue penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.     The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated income tax return in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and three state jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal examinations for years prior to 2013 or state tax examinations for years prior to 2012.       Basic and Diluted Income (Loss) per Common Share      Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted income (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution from common stock equivalents, such as stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options and warrants. There were no dilutive potential common shares as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, because the Company incurred net losses and basic and diluted losses per common share are the same. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, basic and diluted earnings per share approximated each other. Dilutive potential common shares as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately 60.20 million shares and 21.8 million shares, respectively. Anti-dilutive potential common shares as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately .6 million shares and 28.0 million shares, respectively.      Concentration of Credit Risk      Financial instruments that subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash and equivalents on deposit with financial institutions and accounts receivable. The Company s cash as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is on deposit in a non-interest-bearing transaction account that is subject to FDIC deposit insurance limits. For the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, 100% of the Company s revenue related to eight and five customers, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, 100% of the Company s revenue related to eight and five customers, respectively. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, 100% of the Company s accounts receivable related to eight and five customers, respectively.             Contingencies      Certain conditions may exist which may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company s management and its legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company, or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company s legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.   If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company s consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material, would be disclosed.   Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they arise from guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed.      Recently Issued Accounting Standards      In May, 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) Summary - The FASB has made available Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606. ASU 2014-09 affects any entity using U.S. GAAP that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (e.g., insurance contracts or lease contracts). This ASU will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance. This ASU also supersedes some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts. In addition, the existing requirements for the recognition of a gain or loss on the transfer of nonfinancial assets that are not in a contract with a customer (e.g., assets within the scope of Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, and intangible assets within the scope of Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other) are amended to be consistent with the guidance on recognition and measurement (including the constraint on revenue) in this ASU. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: .     Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer.  Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract.   Step 3: Determine the transaction price.   Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.  Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.         For a public entity, the amendments in this ASU are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted. We are currently assessing the impact this standard will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements and required disclosures.     In August, 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to continue as a Going Concern.  ASU 2014-15 is intended to define management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. Under GAAP, financial statements are prepared under the presumption that the reporting organization will continue to operate as a going concern, except in limited circumstances. Financial reporting under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis of accounting is critical to financial reporting because it establishes the fundamental basis for measuring and classifying assets and liabilities. Currently, GAAP lacks guidance about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the organization s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. This ASU provides guidance to an organization s management, with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes. The amendments are effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued. We are currently assessing the impact this standard will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements and required disclosures.     In April, 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.  The amendments in this ASU require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied on a retrospective basis, wherein the balance sheet of each individual period presented should be adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance. Upon transition, an entity is required to comply with the applicable disclosures for a change in an accounting principle. These disclosures include the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle, the transition method, a description of the prior-period information that has been retrospectively adjusted, and the effect of the change on the financial statement line items (i.e., debt issuance cost asset and the debt liability). We have adopted this standard in the current presentation of the Company s consolidated financial statements and required disclosures. By adopting this standard, the Company s balance sheet presentation has changed as certain assets have been reclassified to a liability. The adoption does not alter the accounting for the amortization of debt issuance costs     In June, 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-11, Inventory (Subtopic 330): Simplifying the measurement of Inventory.  The amendments in this ASU require inventory be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We are currently assessing the impact this standard will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements and required disclosures.         In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740)   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. ASU 2015-17 is intended to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes. Deferred tax liabilities and assets will be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position, and the current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount remains the same. This ASU is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We are currently assessing the impact this standard will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements and required disclosures.     In February, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-11,  Leases (Topic 842).  Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability and right-of-use asset at the commencement date for all leases, with the exception of short term leases. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently assessing the impact this standard will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements and required disclosures.     In March, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-09,  Stock Compensation (Topic 718).  This amendment is intended to improve and simplify the accounting for employee share-based payments including areas such as (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows.. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently assessing the impact this standard will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements and required disclosures.       Note 3 - Going Concern       The accompanying consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016 have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company s outstanding convertible notes payable with its senior lender raises doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. As of September 30, 2016, we project that we will fail to remain in compliance with certain covenants with our senior lender in the next twelve months. On November 1, 2016 an amended and restated financing agreement was executed with the senior lender, with closing subject to raising $10 Million in an equity offering. Success in securing this additional financing in order to close this amended agreement is critical. No assurances can be given that the Company will be able to complete this fund raising activity.     The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.       Note 4 - Inventory       During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company began the production of equipment to be sold to its customers. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, costs totaling $196,198 and $2,430,846, respectively, were incurred for component purchases and progress billings from subcontractors on these projects. These costs will be recorded as cost of sales as the systems are commissioned for use by the Company s customers. The Company also held product supply inventory valued at $569,728 and $285,067 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.             Note 5 - Property and Equipment, Net       Property and equipment at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows:             The Company uses the straight-line method of depreciation over 3 to 5 years. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 depreciation expense charged to operations was $264,000 and $75,000, respectively.        Note 6 - License Agreement        On January 15, 2009, the Company entered into an "Exclusive Patent and Know-How License Agreement Including Transfer of Ownership" with the Energy and Environmental Research Center Foundation, a non-profit entity ( EERCF ). Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company has been granted an exclusive license by EERCF for the technology to develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, lease, and import the technology in any coal-fired combustion systems (power plant) worldwide and to develop and perform the technology in any coal-fired power plant in the world. Amendments No. 4 and No. 5 to this agreement were made effective as of December 16, 2013 and August 14, 2014, respectively, expanding the number of patents covered, eliminated certain contract provisions and compliance issues and restructured the fee payments and buyout provisions while granting EERCF equity in the Company. This agreement now applies to 29 domestic and foreign patents and patent applications.      The Company paid EERCF $100,000 in 2009 for the license to use the patents and at the option of the Company can pay $2,500,000 and issue 875,000 shares of common stock for the assignment of the patents or pay the greater of the license maintenance fees or royalties on product sales for continued use of the patents. The license maintenance fees are $25,000 due monthly beginning in January 1, 2014 and continuing each month thereafter. The running royalties are $100 per one megawatt of electronic nameplate capacity and $100 per three megawatt per hour for the application to thermal systems to which licensed products or licensed processes are sold by the Company, associate and sublicenses. Running royalties are payable by the Company within 30 days after the end of each calendar year to the licensor and may be credited against license maintenance fees paid. There were no royalties due for 2015. For 2016, the Company will owe approximately $961,000 based on the current EGU s in operation, with approximately $661,000 due in January 2017 if the Company has not received the assignment of the patents from the EERCF. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company has recorded $481,585 of royalty expense which is included in accrued expenses.         The Company is required to pay EERCF 35% of all sublicense income received by the Company, excluding royalties on sales by sublicensees. Sublicense income is payable by the Company within 30 day after the end of each calendar year to the licensor. This requirement ends at the time the Company pays for the assignment of the patents. There was no sublicense income in 2016 or 2015.     License costs capitalized as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows:                 The Company is currently amortizing its license to use EERCF s patents over their estimated useful life of 17 years when acquired. During the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, amortization expense charged to operations was $4,410 and $4,410, respectively. Estimated annual amortization for each of the next five years is approximately $5,900.           Note 7 - Convertible Notes Payable       The Company has the following convertible notes payable outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:                As of September 30, 2016, scheduled principal payments due on convertible notes payable are as follows:                From April 26, 2012 to January 24, 2013, the Company sold convertible notes to unaffiliated accredited investors totaling $2,675,244.

On August 23, 2016, the Company issued 40,577 shares of common stock upon the conversion of a note with principal and accrued interest totaling $20,289.     On August 14, 2014, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary MES, Inc. ( MES, and together with the Company, collectively the  Companies ) entered into a financing agreement (the  Financing Agreement ) with a newly created independent entity, AC Midwest Energy LLC (the  Lender ). Pursuant to the Financing Agreement, the Company borrowed $10,000,000 from the Lender, evidenced by a convertible note (the  Note ) maturing July 31, 2018, secured by all the assets of the Companies. All the indebtedness under the Note was convertible into common stock of the Company at $1.00 per share, subject to the following adjustments: (i) an adjustment of the price per share down to $0.75 per share if the Company fails to generate EBITDA (earnings before taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization ) of at least $2,500,000 for calendar year 2015; and (ii) weighted average anti-dilution adjustments to the extent that following the issuance of the Note, the Company issues securities or rights to acquire securities at an effective purchase price below the conversion price for the Note, subject to carveouts for certain exempt issuances by the Company. Per an amendment to the Financing Agreement discussed below, the conversion price was adjusted to $0.50 per share and the adjustment to the price per share for failing to generate a certain level of EBITDA was eliminated.      The Note bears interest at 12% per annum, to be paid at the rate of: (i) 12% payment in kind or  PIK  for year one; (ii) 2% cash and 10% PIK for year two; and (iii) 12% all cash for years three and four. The PIK interest is paid by increasing the principal balance of the Note by the PIK amount. The Note cannot be prepaid without the Lender s consent before its second anniversary, and thereafter at 105% of the outstanding indebtedness evidenced by the Note, subject to the right of the Lender to convert the outstanding indebtedness to the Company s common stock prior to prepayment. Principal amortization of the Note is to begin with the first quarter following the second year of the Note at the rate of 7.5% of the original principal amount per quarter and to continue each quarter thereafter, with all unpaid interest to be due at maturity. In the event of default, the interest rate on the Note will be increased by an additional 3% per annum. The Financing Agreement contains numerous affirmative obligations and negative covenants. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1,020,406 and $788,239, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, total principal of $9,646,686 and $9,062,019, respectively, was outstanding on this note.         On March 16, 2015, the Company entered into a Waiver and Amendment to Financing Agreement, and Reaffirmation of Guaranty with AC Midwest Energy, LLC ( Amendment ). This Amendment decreased the conversion price of the convertible note and exercise price of the outstanding warrants to $0.50, respectively. The Company repaid $3,000,000 of outstanding principal on the convertible note as of the close of the Amendment. The Company agreed to new financial covenants as part of the Amendment, which included a waiver for the compliance of certain covenants in the periods prior to the date of the Amendment. In connection with the change in the conversion terms and repayment of principal, the Company incurred a loss of $2,246,105 on this date which was primarily related to accelerated amortization of the discount on convertible notes payable and is included in interest expense.     On November 16, 2015, the Companies entered into Waiver and Amendment No. 2 to Financing Agreement, and Reaffirmation of Guaranty (the  Amendment No. 2 ) with the Lender. Pursuant to Amendment No. 2, the Company issued a new Senior Secured Convertible Note of $600,000 ( First New Note ) purchased by the Lender. In addition, Amendment No. 2 allows for two additional Senior Secured Convertible Notes totaling up to $1,400,000 (which together with the First New Note are referred to herein as the  New Notes ) to be purchased by Lender during 2016 subject to certain conditions being met by both parties. All the indebtedness under the New Notes shall be convertible into common stock of the Company at $0.50 per share, subject to weighted average anti-dilution adjustments to the extent that following the issuance of the New Notes, the Company issues securities or rights to acquire securities at an effective purchase price below the conversion price for the New Notes. As of January 31, 2016, the Company s right to sell one additional New Note for $400,000 expired. The remaining $1,000,000 available with this amendment must be sold to Lender by June 30, 2016. In connection with Amendment No. 2, the Company was required to issue Drexel approximately 200,000 warrants and pay $21,000 as compensation for services rendered. This liability was settled with an amendment to the engagement letter with Drexel on February 19, 2016. These warrants were valued in accordance with FASB ASC 815-10 as liabilities using a Monte Carlo Simulation Model. The fair value of the warrant liability on the issuance date for the warrants to be issued was $55,200. These costs were recorded as debt issuance costs.      On January 28, 2016, the Company entered into Amendment No. 3 to Financing Agreement and Reaffirmation of Guaranty (the  Third Amended Financing Agreement ) with Lender, pursuant to which Lender agreed to cause its bank to arrange for the issuance to a certain customer of the Company a standby letter of credit in the amount of $2,000,000 (the  Letter of Credit ) to permit the Company to enter into a contract for mercury capture program with such customer. The Letter of Credit is to guarantee the Company s performance under its contract with such customer. Under the Third Amended Financing Agreement, and in consideration for the issuance of the Letter of Credit for the benefit of the Company, the Company shall pay AC Midwest a fee equal to 12.0% per annum of the amount available to be drawn under the Letter of Credit (the  Letter of Credit Fee ) payable on the last day of each calendar month. No amounts were received on this letter of credit as of September 30, 2016.           Note 8 - Equipment Notes Payable        The Company has the following equipment notes payable outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:                 As of September 30, 2016, scheduled principal payments due on convertible notes payable are as follows:                  Note 9 - Warrant Liability       On August 14, 2014, Company issued the Lender a warrant to purchase 12,500,000 shares of the Company s common stock at $1.00 per share, subject to the adjustments (see Note 13 for changes to the terms of these warrants). The Company also issued to Drexel for the transaction: (i) a 5-year warrant to purchase up to 800,000 shares of common stock at $1.00 per share; and (ii) a 5-year warrant to purchase up to 1,000,000 shares of common stock at $0.50 per share, both subject to adjustments similar to the Warrant issued to the Lender (see Note 13 for changes to the terms of these warrants). These warrants were valued in accordance with FASB ASC 815-10 as liabilities using a Monte Carlo Simulation Model. The fair value of the warrant liability on the issuance date for all warrants issued was $9,801,200. The warrants issued to Drexel were valued at $1,251,200 and were recorded as transaction costs associated with Financing Agreement.

At issuance of this warrant, the Lender shall be entitled upon any exercise of the warrant to a number of shares of common stock in an amount at least equal to 4.32% of the aggregate number of then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company (as determined on a fully-diluted basis). In addition, if the aggregate number of Warrant Shares purchasable under the Warrant calculated at the time of the initial exercise of the Warrant is less than 4.32% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company at the time of the initial exercise of the Warrant, the Lender s number of Warrant Shares shall be increased by an amount of shares necessary to cause the number of Warrant Shares to represent 4.32% of the aggregate number of then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company on a fully diluted basis.

Pursuant to the Noteholder Modification Agreement, which was entered into in order to resolve the differences between the parties as to the applicability of the MFN provision to the Second Amended Financing Agreement, the Company (i) agreed that the exercise price for each share of common stock purchasable with respect to the 2013 Warrants held by currently outstanding Holders be reduced to $0.35 per share of common stock (resulting in the exercise price being reduced for 2013 Warrants exercisable for 3,290,000 shares), and (ii) agreed to issue to such currently outstanding Holders of 2013 Secured Notes in the aggregate warrants to purchase up to 1,600,000 shares of common stock at $0.35 per share, exercisable at any time on or before November 15, 2020.

On October 4, 2016 the Company granted nonqualified stock options to acquire 100,000 shares of the Company s common stock to Rob Rians. The options granted are exercisable at $1.36 per share, representing the fair market value of the common stock as of the date of grant. These options are fully vested and are exercisable as of the date of the grant and will expire five years thereafter. Based on a Black-Sholes valuation model, these options were valued at $88,629 in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718.      On October 4, 2016 the Company granted nonqualified stock options to acquire 25,000 shares of the Company s common stock to Todd Ferrell. The options granted are exercisable at $1.36 per share, representing the fair market value of the common stock as of the date of grant. These options will vest and become exercisable on February 1, 2018 and will expire five years from the grant date. Based on a Black-Sholes valuation model, these options were valued at $22,157 in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718.          On October 24, 2016 the Company issued 2,286,209 shares of common stock and 571,557 warrants to purchase shares of common stock upon the conversion of a note principal and accrued interest totaling $1,143,101, that bear interest at 12% per annum, and was convertible into units, where each unit consists of: (i) one share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and (ii) a warrant to purchase 0.25 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.75 per share with a conversion ratio equal to $0.50 per unit.     On November 1, 2016, AC Midwest Energy LLC (the  Lender ) deferred the principal payment due of $720,898 per the terms of the Financing Agreement until the note maturity date on July 31, 2018. This amount will be added to principal and will bear interest during this period     On November 1, 2016, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Financing Agreement with the Lender (the  Restated Financing Agreement ). As of November 1, 2016, the outstanding aggregate principal balance owing to the Lender pursuant to the Financing Agreements was $9,646,686 per 12% senior secured convertible notes issued to the Lender and which mature on July 31, 2018 (the  AC Midwest Notes ). Pursuant to the Restated Financing Agreement, Lender, which holds various warrants to acquire shares of the Company s common stock (the  AC Midwest Warrants ), will exercise on a cashless basis a portion of the AC Midwest Warrants for 10,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock and exchange the AC Midwest Notes, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and the remaining unexercised portion of the AC Midwest Warrants, for (i) a new senior secured note in the principal amount of $9,646,686.08, and (ii) a subordinated unsecured note in the principal amount of $13,000,000. The completion of the transactions contemplated by the Restated Financing Agreement are subject to various conditions including but not limited to the closing by the Company of an equity offering raising at least $10.0 million of gross proceeds prior to December 31, 2016.      On November 2, 2016, the Company issued 38,651 shares of common stock upon the cashless exercise of options to purchase 50,000 shares of common stock for $0.37 per share based on a market value of $1.63 per share as determined under the terms of the option.     On November 3, 2016, the Company issued 54,783 shares of common stock upon the cashless exercise of warrants to purchase 70,000 shares of common stock for $0.35 per share based on a market value of $1.61 per share as determined under the terms of the warrant.     On November 7, 2016, the Company issued 103,500 shares of common stock upon the conversion of a note with principal and accrued interest totaling $51,750, that bears interest at 10% per annum, and was convertible into one share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, with a conversion ratio equal to $0.50 per share           ITEM 2 - MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS        Background      Midwest Energy Emissions Corp. (the  Company ,  we ,  us  and  our ) develops and deploys patented, proprietary technologies to remove mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. The U.S. EPA MATS (Mercury and Air Toxics Standards) rule requires that all coal and oil-fired power plants in the U.S., larger than 25MWs, must limit mercury in its emissions to below certain specified levels, according to the type of coal burned. Power plants were required to begin complying with MATS on April 16, 2015, unless they were granted a one-year extension to begin to comply. MATS, along with many state and provincial regulations, form the basis for mercury emission capture at coal fired plants across North America. Under the MATS regulation, Electric Generating Units ( EGUs ) are required to remove about 90% of the mercury from their emissions. We believe that we continue to meet the requirements of the industry as a whole and our technologies have been shown to achieve mercury removal levels compliant with all state, provincial and federal regulations at a lower cost and with less plant impact than our competition.      As is typical in this market, we are paid by the EGU based on how much of our material is injected to achieve the needed level of mercury removal. Our current clients pay us as material is delivered to their facility. Clients will use our material whenever their EGUs operate, although EGUs are not always in operation. EGUs typically may not be in operation due to maintenance reasons or when the price of power in the market is less than their cost to produce power. Thus, our revenues from EGU clients will not typically be a consistent stream but will fluctuate, especially seasonally as the market demand for power fluctuates.      The MATS regulation has been subject to legal challenge, and in June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the EPA unreasonably failed to consider costs in determining whether to regulate hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, from power plants and remanded the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for further proceedings, but left the rule in place. In December 2015, the D.C. Circuit remanded the rule to the EPA for further consideration, without vacatur, allowing MATS to remain in effect until the EPA issues a final finding. On March 18, 2016, 20 states filed a petition for certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court to review the D.C. Circuit's decision to remand without vacatur the MATS rule to the EPA which petition for certiorari was denied by the U.S. Supreme Court on June 13, 2016. In the meantime, on April 14, 2016, the EPA issued a final supplemental finding upholding the rule and concluding that a cost analysis supports the MATS rule. While the Company expects that the issuance by the EPA of its final finding will keep MATS in effect going forward, the Company is unable to predict with certainty the outcome of any such further proceedings.     We remain focused on positioning the Company for short and long-term growth. In the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we focused on execution at our customer sites and on continual operation improvement. We continue to make refinements to all of our key products, as we continue to focus on the customer and its operations. We also hired a new regional sales manager to cover the U.S. Southwest and continued to expand our employee base as we plan for future growth. As described below, we achieved substantial increases in revenues compared to the prior year. We ended the second quarter of 2016 with 20 fully operational MATS compliant EGU s utilizing our technologies. We expect revenue growth throughout the rest of 2016 and beyond. Due to our strengthening financial position, we negotiated a debt exchange agreement with Alterna, which upon closing will reduce dilution by over 34 million shares and simplify our capital structure and we were able to work with many of our earliest investors to convert their promissory notes into equity soon after the end of the quarter. These events not only will improve our balance sheet significantly, but position the Company to further increase shareholder value well into the future.            Results of Operations      The second fiscal quarter of 2016 was a quarter of continued revenue growth and business plan execution. During the quarter, the Company saw its entire customer base continue their MATS compliance activities. During the quarter, the Company had long terms contracts on 20 EGU s. The compliance efforts of our customer base resulted in exponential sales growth over the same period last year and positive cash flow from operations.       Revenues       Sales  - We generated revenues of approximately $11,771,000 and $3,626,000 for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and $24,537,000 and $6,566,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Total sorbent product sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $11,453,000 and $2,387,000, respectively. Total sorbent product sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $21,163,000 and $3,240,000, respectively. These increases from the prior year were associated with the MATS compliance activities of our customers, which began in April 2016, with all of our customers in operation by the end of the period.      Equipment sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $143,000 and $1,239,000, respectively. Equipment sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $2,699,000 and $3,206,000, respectively. Equipment sales during 2016 are primarily related to the commissioning of one customer project that included both a front end and back end product injection systems. In 2015, equipment sales were primarily related to three front end injection systems.      Other revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $175,000 and $0, respectively. Other revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $675,000 and $120,000, respectively. This increase is primarily associated with increased demonstration revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2016 from the same period in the prior year.      Cost and Expenses       Costs and expenses  were $10,034,000 and $3,850,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and were $22,665,000 and $8,727,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in costs and expenses from the prior year is primarily attributable to an increase in costs of sales during the current quarter compared to the same period in the prior year. These increases are primarily associated with the significant increase in revenues in the quarter ended September 30, 2016.      Cost of sales  during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $7,821,000 and $2,704,000, respectively, and were $17,613,000 and $5,545,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in cost is primarily attributable to the significant increase in product sales in 2016. Direct product costs during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $6,328,000 and $1,363,000, respectively, and were $11,474,000 and $1,859,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.          Equipment cost of sales during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $115,000 and $859,000, respectively, and were $2,620,000 and $2,236,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in the costs in the three months ended September 30, 2016 is due to the decrease in equipment sales from the same period in the prior year. The decrease in margin on equipment sales in in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily attributable to the large project that was completed during the period which was subcontracted to a third party. The Company also had increases in license costs, overhead, depreciation and amortization during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 from the same periods in 2015 due to the increase in business operations as its customers began MATS compliance activities in 2016.      Selling, general and administrative expenses  were $2,214,000 and $1,146,000 for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and were $5,052,000 and $3,182,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily attributed increases in sales commissions and stock based compensation associated with stock options issued to officers, directors and employees.      Other Expenses      Interest expenserelated to the financing of capital was $973,000 and $906,000 during the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and were $4,079,000 and $5,264,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In connection with change in the conversion terms and repayment of principal during the quarter ended March 31, 2015, per the Amendment with AC Midwest Energy, LLC, the Company incurred a loss of $2,246,000 which was primarily related to accelerated amortization of the discount on convertible notes payable and is included in interest expense during that period. During the quarter ended March 31, 2016, The Company incurred a charge of $1,125,000 related to warrants issued in connection with the issuance of a letter of credit which was included in interest expense. During the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, a loss of $9,985,000 and a gain of $145,000, respectively, on the change in value of warrant liability was recorded. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, a loss of $14,241,000 and a gain of $1,461,000, respectively, on the change in value of warrant liability was recorded.       Net Income (Loss)      For the quarter ended September 30, 2016 we had a net loss of approximately $9,302,000. For the quarter ended September 30, 2015, we had net loss of approximately $1,155,000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 we had a net loss of $16,636,000 and $7,123,000, respectively.       Taxes      As of September 30, 2016, our deferred tax assets are primarily related to accrued compensation and net operating losses. A 100% valuation allowance has been established due to the uncertainty of the utilization of these assets in future periods. As a result, the deferred tax asset was reduced to zero and no income tax benefit was recorded. The net operating loss carryforward will begin to expire in 2031.      Section 382 of the Internal Code allows post-change corporations to use pre-change net operating losses, but limit the amount of losses that may be used annually to a percentage of the entity value of the corporation at the date of the ownership change. The applicable percentage is the federal long-term tax-exempt rate for the month during which the change in ownership occurs.            Non-GAAP Financial Measures       Adjusted EBITDA      To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP and to provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we consider and are including herein Adjusted EBITDA, a Non-GAAP financial measure. We view Adjusted EBITDA as an operating performance measure and, as such, we believe that the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to it is net income (loss). We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock based compensation, and other non-cash income and expenses. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides us an important measure of operating performance because it allows management, investors, debtholders and others to evaluate and compare ongoing operating results from period to period by removing the impact of our asset base, any asset disposals or impairments, stock based compensation and other non-cash income and expense items associated with our reliance on issuing equity-linked debt securities to fund our working capital.      Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and this measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP, as the excluded items may have significant effects on our operating results and financial condition. Additionally, our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from other companies  measure of Adjusted EBITDA. When evaluating our performance, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered with other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income and other GAAP results. In the future, we may disclose different non-GAAP financial measures in order to help our investors and others more meaningfully evaluate and compare our future results of operations to our previously reported results of operations.     We prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table shows our reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively:                       We are including below our unaudited reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA on a quarterly basis for the quarters ended December 31, 2015, March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016:               Liquidity and Capital Resources      Our principal source of liquidity is cash generated from operating activities. As of September 30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $2,048,000.       Total assets  were $11,440,000 at September 30, 2016 versus $7,315,000 at December 31, 2015. The change in total assets is primarily attributable to the increases in accounts receivable, property and equipment and inventory.       Total liabilities  were $38,161,000 at September 30, 2016 versus $20,260,000 at December 31, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the fair value of the Company s warrant liability increased significantly. Also during this period there was an increase in current operating liabilities associated with the increased sales operations during the period.      Operating activities  provided $2,308,000 of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to using $2,594,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The change in cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributable to the increase in revenues and gross margin during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.      Investing activities  used $1,348,000 and $705,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In 2016 and 2015, additions of property and equipment associated with the expansion of our operations in preparation for MATS compliance activities of our customers were responsible for these expenditures.      Financing activities  provided $4,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to using $3,000,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to the repayment of principal of convertible promissory notes. Payments on equipment notes payable used $22,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.      Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements      We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, and results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures.            Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates      Our discussion and analysis of our financial conditions and results of operation are based upon the accompanying consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management evaluates on an on-going basis our estimates with respect to the valuation allowances for accounts receivable, income taxes, accrued expenses and equity instrument valuation, for example. We base these estimates on various assumptions and experience that we believe to be reasonable. The following critical accounting policies are those that are important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations. These policies require management s most difficult, complex, or subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain.     The following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. In particular, our most critical accounting policies relate to the recognition of revenue, and the valuation of our stock-based compensation.      Going Concern      The accompanying consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016 have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company s outstanding convertible notes payable with its senior lender raises doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. As of September 30, 2016, we project that we will fail to remain in compliance with certain covenants with our senior lender in the next twelve months. On November 1, 2016 an amended and restated financing agreement was executed with the senior lender, with closing subject to raising $10 Million in an equity offering. Success in securing this additional financing in order to close this amended agreement is critical. No assurances can be given that the Company will be able to complete this fund raising activity.   The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.      Accounts Receivable       Trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount the Company expects to collect. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Management considers the following factors when determining the collectability of specific customer accounts: customer credit-worthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic industry trends, and changes in customer payment terms. Past due balances over 90 days and other higher risk amounts are reviewed individually for collectability. If the financial condition of the Company s customers were to deteriorate, adversely affecting their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. Based on management s assessment, the Company provides for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance. Balances that remain outstanding after the Company has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable.            Revenue Recognition      The Company records revenue from sales in accordance with ASC 605,  Revenue Recognition  ( ASC 605 ). The criteria for recognition are as follows:     1. Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;     2. Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered;     3. The seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and     4. Collectability is reasonably assured.     Determination of criteria (3) and (4) will be based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments will be provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded.      Income Taxes       Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets, including tax loss and credit carryforwards, and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred income tax expense represents the change during the period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current and non-current based on their characteristics. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.     The recognition, measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in an enterprise s consolidated financial statements are based on a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold. The Company recorded a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. We intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. However, given our current earnings and anticipated future earnings, we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that within the next 12 months, sufficient positive evidence will become available to allow us to reach a conclusion that a portion of the valuation allowance will no longer be needed. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. The exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on the basis of the level of profitability that we are able to actually achieve. When necessary, the Company would accrue penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.     The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated income tax return in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and three state jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal examinations for years prior to 2013 or state tax examinations for years prior to 2012.             Stock-Based Compensation      We have adopted the provisions of  Share-Based Payments , which requires that share-based payments be reflected as an expense based upon the grant-date fair value of those grants. Accordingly, the fair value of each option grant, non-vested stock award and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan, were estimated on the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of these grants using the Black-Scholes model which requires us to make certain estimates in the assumptions used in this model, including the expected term the award will be held, the volatility of the underlying common stock, the discount rate, dividends and the forfeiture rate. The expected term represents the period of time that grants and awards are expected to be outstanding. Expected volatilities were based on historical volatility of our stock. The risk-free interest rate approximates the U.S. treasury rate corresponding to the expected term of the option. Dividends were assumed to be zero. Forfeiture estimates are based on historical data. These inputs are based on our assumptions, which we believe to be reasonable but that include complex and subjective variables. Other reasonable assumptions could result in different fair values for our stock-based awards. Stock-based compensation expense, as determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures. To the extent that actual results or revised estimates differ from the estimates used, those amounts will be recorded as an adjustment in the period that estimates are revised.      Warrant Liability      On August 14, 2014, Company issued the Lender a warrant to purchase 12,500,000 shares of the Company s common stock at $1.00 per share, subject to the adjustments (see Note 13 for changes to the terms of these warrants). The Company also issued to Drexel for the transaction: (i) a 5-year warrant to purchase up to 800,000 shares of common stock at $1.00 per share; and (ii) a 5-year warrant to purchase up to 1,000,000 shares of common stock at $0.50 per share, both subject to adjustments similar to the Warrant issued to the Lender (see Note 13 for changes to the terms of these warrants). During the three months ended September 30, 2016, Drexel and its assigns exercised 1,024,929 warrants (see Note 11).     On November 16, 2015, Company issued the Lender a contingent warrant to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock at $0.35 per share, subject to adjustments, which warrant shall be immediately exercisable for 3,600,000 shares with the balance of 1,400,000 shares exercisable proportionately to such additional Senior Convertible Notes up to $1,400,000 purchased by the Lender (see Note 13 for the terms of these warrants).      On January 28, 2016, in consideration for the issuance of the Letter of Credit, the Company has agreed to issue to Lender (i) a five year warrant to purchase 2,000,000 shares of common stock, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustment provisions at an exercise price of $0.35 per share of common stock.      On February 19, 2016, in connection to Amendment No. 2 and Amendment No. 3, the Company issued Drexel: a 5-year warrant to purchase up to 300,000 shares of common stock at $0.35 per share as compensation for services rendered.      These warrants are valued in accordance with FASB ASC 815-10 as liabilities using a Monte Carlo Simulation Model as of each reporting period date and the change in value can have a significant impact on the Company s bottom line. The significant assumptions considered by the model were the remaining term of the warrants, operational forecasts provided by the Company, the fair value per share stock price, a risk free treasury rate and an expected volatility rate at each measurement date.      Warrants      Unless sold and issued warrants are subject to the provisions of FASB ASC 815-10, the Company utilized a Black-Scholes options pricing model to value the warrants sold and issued. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions such as the expected stock price volatility and the expected period until the warrants are exercised. When calculating the value of warrants issued, the Company uses a volatility factor of 74.9%, a risk free interest rate and the life of the warrant for the exercise period. When sold and issued warrants were valued in accordance with FASB ASC 815-10, the fair value was determined using a Monte Carlo Simulation Model.              ITEM 3 - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.       ITEM 4 - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES       Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this report, that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as a result of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. The ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures was due to the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which are common to many small companies: (i) lack of a sufficient complement of personnel commensurate with the Company s reporting requirements; and (ii) insufficient written documentation or training of our internal control policies and procedures which provide staff with guidance or framework for accounting and disclosing financial transactions.     Despite the existence of the material weaknesses above, we believe that the consolidated financial statements contained in this Form 10-Q fairly present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in all material respects.       Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting       During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we completed the installation of ERP software used to manage our business activities and increased the segregation of duties with the hiring and training of additional administrative staff. We believe that these efforts effectively strengthen our disclosure control processes and procedures.             PART II - OTHER INFORMATION         ITEM 1 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS       None       ITEM 1a - RISK FACTORS       We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.       ITEM 2 - UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS       None       ITEM 3 - DEFAULT UPON SENIOR SECURITIES       Not applicable.
