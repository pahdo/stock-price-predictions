 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

1.    Basis of Presentation    

The accompanying
unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles
for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do
not include all of the information and footnotes required by United States generally accepted accounting principles for complete
financial statements. 

The accompanying consolidated
financial statements reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results
for the interim periods presented. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Operating results for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December
31, 2016. The consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the 2015 annual report and the notes thereto. 

2.    Business Description and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    

Business
Description  

Servotronics, Inc.
and its subsidiaries design, manufacture and market advanced technology products consisting primarily of control components and
consumer products consisting of knives and various types of cutlery and other edged products. 

Principles
of Consolidation  

The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Servotronics, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the  Company ). All intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents  

The Company considers
cash and cash equivalents to include all cash accounts and short-term investments purchased with an original maturity of three
months or less. 

Accounts
Receivable  

The Company grants
credit to substantially all of its customers and carries its accounts receivable at original invoice amount less an allowance for
doubtful accounts. On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates its accounts receivable and establishes an allowance for doubtful
accounts based on history of past write-offs, collections, and current credit conditions. The allowance for doubtful accounts amounted
to approximately $80,000 at September 30, 2016 and $88,000 at December 31, 2015. The Company does not accrue interest on past due
receivables. 

Revenue
Recognition  

Revenues are recognized
as services are rendered or as units are shipped and at the designated FOB point consistent with the transfer of title, risks and
rewards of ownership. Such purchase orders generally include specific terms relative to quantity, item description, specifications,
price, customer responsibility for in-process costs, delivery schedule, shipping point, payment and other standard terms and conditions
of purchase. 

Inventories  

Inventories are stated
at the lower of standard cost or net realizable value. Cost includes all costs incurred to bring each product to its present location
and condition. Market provisions in respect of lower of cost or market adjustments and inventory expected to be used in greater
than one year are applied to the gross value of the inventory through a reserve of approximately $1,443,000 and $1,429,000 at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Pre-production and start-up costs are expensed as incurred. 

SERVOTRONICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The purchase of suppliers 
minimum economic quantities of material such as steel, etc. may result in a purchase of quantities exceeding one year of customer
requirements. Also, in order to maintain a reasonable and/or agreed to lead time, certain larger quantities of other product support
items may have to be purchased and may result in over one year s supply. 

Shipping
and Handling Costs  

Shipping
and handling costs are classified as a component of cost of goods sold. 

Property,
Plant and Equipment  

Property, plant and
equipment is carried at cost; expenditures for new facilities and equipment and expenditures which substantially increase the useful
lives of existing plant and equipment are capitalized; expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Upon
disposal of properties, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any profit or
loss on disposition is included in income. 

In 2015,
the Company s CPG received approximately $700,000 in County and State grants that were used towards the purchase of machinery
and equipment. The Company recorded the grant proceeds as a reduction to the carrying value of the related assets. See Note 7,
Commitments and Contingencies, for more information related to the facility expansion and subject grants. 

Depreciation is provided
on the basis of estimated useful lives of depreciable properties, primarily by the straight-line method for financial statement
purposes and by accelerated methods for tax purposes. Depreciation expense includes the amortization of capital lease assets. The
estimated useful lives of depreciable properties are generally as follows: 

Income
Taxes  

The Company recognizes
deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts
and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as operating loss and credit carryforwards. The Company and its subsidiaries
file a consolidated federal income tax return, combined New York and Texas state income tax returns and separate Pennsylvania and
Arkansas income tax returns. 

The Company s practice
is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The Company did not have any accrued
interest or penalties included in its consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015, and did not recognize
any interest and/or penalties in its consolidated statements of income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015. The Company did not have any material uncertain tax positions or unrecognized tax benefits or obligations as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The 2013 through 2015 federal and state tax returns remain subject to examination. 

Supplemental
Cash Flow Information  

Income
taxes paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to approximately $644,000 and $136,000. Interest paid
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to approximately $ 54,000 and $60,000 ,
respectively.   

SERVOTRONICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Employee
Stock Ownership Plan  

Contributions to the
employee stock ownership plan are determined annually by the Company according to plan formula. 

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets  

The Company reviews
long-lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of the assets may not be fully recoverable based on undiscounted future operating cash flow analyses. If an impairment is determined
to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any,
are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal. The Company has determined that no impairment of long-lived
assets existed at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Use
of Estimates  

The preparation of
the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Reclassifications  

Certain
balances as previously reported were reclassified to conform with classifications adopted in the current period. 

Research
and Development Costs  

Research
and development costs are expensed as incurred. 

Concentration
of Credit Risks  

Financial instruments
that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risks principally consist of cash accounts in financial institutions.
Although the accounts exceed the federally insured deposit amount, management does not anticipate nonperformance by the financial
institutions. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments  

The carrying amount
of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses are reasonable estimates of their fair
value due to their short maturity. Based on variable interest rates and the borrowing rates currently available to the Company
for loans similar to its long-term debt, the fair value approximates its carrying amount. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements  

In February
2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842).  There are elements of the new standard that could impact almost
all entities to some extent, although the lessees will likely see the most significant changes. Lessee will need to recognize virtually
all of their leases on the balance sheet, by recording the right-of-use asset and a lease liability. Public business entities are
required to adopt the new leasing standard for fiscal years, and interim period within those fiscal years, beginning December 15,
2018. For calendar year-end public companies, this means an adoption date of January 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The
Company has not yet performed an assessment of the impact on the financial statements and disclosures. 

SERVOTRONICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

In March
2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-09,  Compensation
- Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  which amends the current stock
compensation guidance. The amendments simplify the accounting for the taxes related to stock based compensation, including adjustments
to how excess tax benefits and a company s payments for tax withholdings should be classified. The standard is effective for fiscal
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption
of this standard will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

3.    Inventories    

4.    Property, Plant and Equipment  

Property, plant and
equipment includes land and facilities in Elma and Franklinville, New York. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, accumulated
depreciation on the building amounted to approximately $3,418,000 and $3,258,000, respectively. 

Depreciation
and amortization expense amounted to $198,00 0  and $ 185,000  for
the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and amounted to $610,000 and $525,000 for the nine month
periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company believes that it maintains property and casualty insurance
in amounts adequate for the risk and nature of its assets and operations and which are generally customary in its industry.  

As of September 30, 2016,
there is approximately $64,000 ($57,000   2015) of construction in progress included in property, plant and equipment all
of which is related to capital projects at the Advanced Technology Group. See Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies, for more information
on anticipated capital expenditures. 

SERVOTRONICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

5.    Long-Term Debt    

The Company
has a $2,000,000 line of credit on which there was no balance outstanding at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

The term loans and line
of credit are secured by all personal property of the Company with the exception of certain equipment that was purchased from proceeds
of government grants.  

Certain lenders require
the Company to comply with debt covenants as described in the specific loan documents, including a debt service ratio. At September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the Company was in compliance with these covenants. 

6.    Shareholders  Equity    

The
Company s Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 450,000 shares of its common stock in the open market or in
privately negotiated transactions. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has purchased  337,609  shares
and there remain  112,391  shares available to purchase under this program. There were  5,639
 shares purchased by the Company during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016.   

On April 18, 2013, the
Company issued 165,000 shares of restricted stock to Executive Officers of the Company under the Company s 2012 Long-Term Incentive
Plan that was approved by the shareholders at the 2012 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. This plan authorizes the issuance of up
to 300,000 shares. The restricted share awards vest over four year periods between January 2014 and January 2017 and have voting
rights and accrue dividends prior to vesting. The aggregate amount of expense to the Company, measured based on grant date fair
value is expected to be $1,336,500 and will be recognized over the four year requisite service period. 

SERVOTRONICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

On April
11, 2016, the Company issued 51,000 shares of restricted stock to Executive Officers and certain key management of the Company
under the Company s 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The restricted share awards have varying vesting periods between January
2017 and January 2018; however, these shares have voting rights and accrue dividends prior to vesting. The aggregate amount of
expense to the Company, measured based on grant date fair value is expected to be approximately $406,000 and will be recognized
over the requisite service period. 

Included
in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is approximately $386,000 and $271,000, respectively, of compensation expense
related to the restricted share awards. 

On
January 1, 2016, 41,250 shares of restricted stock vested of which  17,335  shares were withheld
and repurchased by the Company for approximately $145,000 to satisfy statutory minimum withholding tax requirements for those participants
who elected this option as permitted under the Company s 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan.   

On March
14, 2016, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a $0.15 per share cash dividend. The dividend was subsequently
paid on May 16, 2016 to shareholders of record on April 11, 2016 and was approximately $380,000 in the aggregate. These dividends
do not represent that the Company will pay dividends on a regular or scheduled basis. The amount is recorded as a reduction to
retained earnings on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. 

Earnings
Per Share  

Basic earnings per
share is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. The weighted
average number of common shares outstanding does not include any potentially dilutive securities or any unvested restricted shares
of common stock. These unvested restricted shares, although classified as issued and outstanding, are considered forfeitable until
the restrictions lapse and will not be included in the basic EPS calculation until the shares are vested. Diluted earnings per
share is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period plus the number
of shares of common stock that would be issued assuming all contingently issuable shares having a dilutive effect on the earnings
per share that were outstanding for the period. Incremental shares from assumed conversions are calculated as the number of shares
that would be issued, net of the number of shares that could be purchased in the marketplace with the cash received upon stock
option exercise. The dilutive effect of unvested restricted stock is determined using the treasury stock method.

7.    Commitments and Contingencies  

Litigation. 
The Company has pending litigation relative to leases of certain equipment and real property with a former related party,
Aero, Inc. Aero, Inc. is suing Servotronics, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary and has alleged damages in the amount of
$3,000,000. The Company has filed a response to the Aero, Inc. lawsuit and has also filed a counter-claim in the amount
of $3,191,000. The Company considers the risk of loss remote, and is unable to reasonably or accurately estimate the
likelihood and amount of any liability or benefit that may be realized as a result of this litigation. Accordingly, no
gain or loss has been recognized in the accompanying financial statements related to this litigation. 

Final
Arbitration Award.   As previously disclosed in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ),
in the first quarter of 2015 the Company paid a former Executive Officer of the Company (the  Former Employee ) an
arbitration award in connection with the termination of the Former Employee s employment agreement. The Company is also expected
to pay post employment health related benefits for the Former Employee, of which approximately $471,000 has been accrued as of
September 30, 2016 and is reflected as Accrued Arbitration Award Liability in the accompanying balance sheet. 

Agreement
with respect to Insurance Claim . As previously disclosed, the Company received $4,500,000 in the first quarter of 2015 from
the carrier related to the Company s claim for insurance for damages the Company suffered in connection with the above arbitration
proceeding. The insurance carrier also paid under the policy partial attorney fees incurred by the Company in defense of the arbitration.
The Company recorded the benefit from this agreement during the first quarter of 2015.    

Facility
Expansion.  As previously disclosed, the Company has commenced a multi-year investment plan designed to consolidate the operations
of the CPG. The five year plan included the construction of an approximate 28,000 square foot addition, capital improvements to
the existing plant, the reconfiguration of its production process within the expanded facility, and the addition of new state of
the art knife-making equipment. The Company broke ground in the second quarter of 2014 and is now manufacturing in the newly constructed
facility. The cost of the project is approximately $4,000,000 over a five year period of which approximately $3,432,000 was completed
as of September 30, 2016 and is included in property, plant and equipment. 

SERVOTRONICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The Company s
CPG was awarded certain incentives from the County of Cattaraugus Industrial Development Agency (CCIDA) in connection with the
expansion of the Company s CPG facility in Franklinville, New York and other proposed capital expenditures. The incentives
include certain real property tax and sales tax abatements in connection with the proposed project. The Company s CPG entered
into customary lease and leaseback arrangements with the CCIDA to facilitate the various tax incentives. 

The Company s
CPG has also been awarded a $300,000 grant from Cattaraugus County, New York. The grant can be used towards new manufacturing equipment
in connection with the proposed expansion project. As part of the terms of the Grant Contract with Cattaraugus County, the Company s
CPG has agreed to maintain certain employment levels for a period of five years from the date of the agreement, March 13, 2014.
If the employment levels are not maintained, the Company will be required to repay the grant proceeds on a prorated basis. As of
September 30, 2016, the Company has maintained the required employment levels. The Company s CPG was also awarded a $416,000
New York State Community Development Block Grant from the Office of Community Renewal to be used towards the purchase of equipment.
As of December 31, 2015, the Company had received the grants in full and recorded them as a reduction to the carrying value of
the asset. 

8.    Litigation    

Except as set forth in
Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies, there are no other legal proceedings currently pending by or against the Company other than
ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business which is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the business
or earnings of the Company. 

9.    Business Segments    

The Company operates
in two business segments, Advanced Technology Group ( ATG ) and Consumer Products Group ( CPG ). The Company s
reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services. The segments are composed of separate
corporations and are managed separately. Operations in ATG primarily involve the design, manufacture, and marketing of servo-control
components (i.e., torque motors, control valves, actuators, etc.) for government, commercial and industrial applications. CPG s
operations involve the design, manufacture and marketing of a variety of cutlery products for use by consumers and government agencies.
The Company derives its primary sales revenue from domestic customers, although a portion of finished products are for foreign
end use. 

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had identifiable assets of approximately $ 36,130,000  ($34,374,000
  December 31, 2015) of which approximately $ 24,211,000  ($22,789,000   December
31, 2015) was for ATG and approximately $ 11,919,000  ($11,585,000   December 31, 2015)

SERVOTRONICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Components of other
income include interest income on cash and cash equivalents, and other amounts not directly related to the sale of the Company s
products. Other income is immaterial in relationship to the consolidated financial statements. 

On November 8, 2016 the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a contract to sell unused commercial real property in Franklinville, New York for approximately $180,000. It is anticipated the sale will be completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Completion of the sale is subject to customary closing conditions. The Company estimates that the gain/loss on the sale will be immaterial to the consolidated financial statements. 

Item 2.   
      Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview   

D uring
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 approximately 9% and 11%, respectively, and 10% for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 of the Company s revenues were derived from contracts with agencies of the U.S. Government or their prime
contractors and their subcontractors.  The Company believes that government involvement in military
operations overseas will continue to have an impact on the financial results in both the Advanced Technology and Consumer Products
markets. While the Company is optimistic in relation to these potential opportunities, it recognizes that sales to the government
are affected by defense budgets, the foreign policies of the U.S. and other nations, the level of military operations and other
factors, and as such, it is difficult to predict the impact on future financial results.  

The Company s commercial
business is affected by such factors as uncertainties in today s global economy, global competition, the vitality and ability
of the commercial aviation industry to purchase new aircraft, the effects and threats of terrorism, market demand and acceptance
both for the Company s products and its customers  products which incorporate Company made components. 

The ATG
engages in business development efforts in its primary markets and is broadening its activities to include new domestic and foreign
markets that are consistent with its core competencies. We believe our business remains particularly well positioned in the strong
commercial aircraft market driven by the replacement of older aircraft with more fuel efficient alternatives and the increasing
demand for air travel in emerging markets. Although the ATG backlog continues to be strong, actual scheduled shipments may be delayed/changed
as a function of the Company s customers  final delivery determinations based on changes in the global economy and
other factors. 

The CPG continues to diversify
its revenue streams with a broader government focus and new commercial channels, including the addition of national retailers,
international accounts, and a direct-to-consumer business line in response to recent and ongoing reductions in military spending.
The CPG is also actively growing its custom manufacturing business to provide a wide range of metal and plastic fabrication services
to a variety of consumer and industrial companies. New product development is focused on the commercialization of products with
applications that span government and civilian requirements to maximize demand or that open up new lines of business entirely.

Results
of Operations  

The following
table compares the Company s consolidated statements of income data for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 ($000 s omitted): 

Revenue  

The
Company s consolidated revenues from operations increased approximately  $1,586,000  or
 5.8%  for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 and decreased approximately  $244,000
 or  2.5%  for the three month period ended September 30, 2016
when compared to the same periods in 2015. The increase in revenue is the result of increases in commercial shipments at ATG not
fully offset by the decrease in commercial and government shipments at CPG.   

Cost of Goods Sold  

Cost
of goods sold as a percentage of revenues decreased from  74.8%  to  72.8%  for
the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 and increased from  71.0%  to  74.4%
 for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same periods in 2015 due
in part to the mix of product sold as well as the realization of implemented operational efficiencies attributed to increased production
volumes for in-house and outsourced operations. Total employment levels grew from 297 employees at September 30, 2015 to 317 at
September 30, 2016. The increase in employees is in response to an increase in production capacity requirements at ATG as evidenced
by an increase of 23% in the value of purchase orders placed when comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the same
period of 2015. The Company continues to pursue cost saving opportunities in material procurements and other operating efficiencies
including capital investments and technical developments in updated and new equipment/machinery as well as investing in the development
and training of its labor force.  

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses  

Selling,
general and administrative (SG A) expenses increased approximately  $252,000  or  5.5%
 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 and increased approximately  $172,000
 or  11.6%  for the three month period ended September 30,
2016 when compared to the same periods in 2015. Approximately 65% of SG A expense relates to labor and labor related expense
to support SG A functions. Such expenses increased approximately $136,000 primarily due to an increase in salaries, wages and
employee benefit costs for new and existing employees. Approximately 12% of SG A expense is attributable to the sales and marketing
of products including commissions and royalty expenses. These expenses increased approximately $122,000 as a result of additional
media and catalog advertising and travel opportunities to promote new product development. Approximately 9% of SG A expense
is attributable to professional and legal services, such expenses decreased approximately $28,000 primarily due to a reduction
in legal expenses associated with the previously disclosed arbitration proceedings with a Former Employee.   

Depreciation
and Amortization Expense  

Depreciation
and amortization increased approximately  $85,000  or  16.2%  for
the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 and increased approximately  $13,000  or  7.0%
 for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same periods in 2015 primarily
due to the assets related to the CPG expansion and renovation being placed in service in late 2015. Depreciation expense fluctuates
due to variable estimated useful lives of depreciable property (as identified in Note 2, Business Description and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies) as well as the amount and nature of capital expenditures in current and previous periods. It is anticipated
that the Company s future capital expenditures and related depreciation and amortization expense will, at a minimum, follow
the Company s requirements to support its manufacturing delivery commitments and to meet certain information technology related
capital expenditure requirements. See also Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies, for more information on anticipated capital expenditures.  

Arbitration Award Expense  

The
Company incurred approximately  $50,000  in additional interest in the first quarter of 2015
related to an arbitration award finalized on February 23, 2015, prior to payment of the award on March 6, 2015. The Company does
not expect to have any further material expenditures related to the arbitration.  

Insurance Proceeds - Arbitration  

On February
20, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with its insurance carrier pursuant to which the Company received $4,500,000 from
the carrier related to the Company s claim for insurance for damages the Company suffered in connection with the previously discussed
arbitration proceeding. The insurance carrier also paid under the policy partial attorney fees incurred by the Company in defense
of the arbitration. The insurance proceeds were used to pay the majority of the arbitration award with the remainder being paid
by the Company using cash on hand.  See also Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies, for more information.  

Interest
Expense  

Interest
expense remained consistent for the nine and three month periods ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same periods in
2015. See also Note 5, Long-Term Debt, for information on long-term debt. 

Other
Income  

Components
of other income include interest income on cash and cash equivalents and other amounts not directly related to the sale of the
Company s products. Other income is immaterial in relationship to the consolidated financial statements. 

Income Taxes  

The Company s
effective tax rate was approximately 31.0% and 34.0% for the nine month periods and approximately 34.2% and 34.0% for the three
month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effective tax rate in both years reflects federal and state
income taxes, permanent non-deductible expenditures and the federal tax credit for research and development expenditures. 

Net Income  

Net
income  for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016  decreased approximately  $2,508,000
and decreased approximately $378,000  for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 when compared
to the same periods in 2015. The nine month decrease is the result of the insurance settlement received on February 20, 2015 as
discussed in Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies, offset by increases in revenues and operating profits in the respective periods.
The Company primarily attributes the three month decrease in net income to the decrease in sales and profits at the CPG.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources  

The
Company s primary liquidity and capital requirements relate to working capital needs; primarily inventory, accounts receivable
and accounts payable as well as capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and principal and interest payments on debt.
At September 30, 2016, the Company had working capital of approximately  $20,796,000  ($19,959,000
  December 31, 2015) of which approximately  $2,867,000  ($3,268,000   December
31, 2015) was comprised of cash and cash equivalents.  

The
Company generated approximately  $1,372,000  in cash from operations during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. Cash was generated primarily through net income, timing differences in payments to vendors as well as
other accrued items. The primary use of cash for the Company s operating activities for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 include working capital requirements, mainly timing differences on collections of accounts receivable, increases in inventory
and other current assets. Cash generated and used in operations is consistent with sales volume, customer expectations and competitive
pressures. The Company s primary use of cash in its financing and investing activities in the nine months ended September
30, 2016 included approximately  $410,000  of current principal payments on long-term debt,
approximately $380,000 for cash dividends paid on May 16, 2016 as well as approximately  $197,000  for
the purchase of treasury shares. The Company also expended approximately  $786,000  for capital
expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

On December
1, 2014, the Company, entered into a Loan Agreement that provides for a $2,620,000 seven-year term loan (the  Term Loan )
and $2,000,000 line of credit (the  Line of Credit ). The Line of Credit, which replaced the Company s previous
$2,000,000 line of credit, was renewed on May 23, 2016 and is available until June 21, 2017, unless subsequently renewed. As of
September 30, 2016, there were no draws on the line. The proceeds from the Term Loan were used to pay off the Industrial Development
Revenue Bonds that were issued by a government agency in 1994 to finance the construction of the Company s headquarters/advanced
technology facility and which matured on December 1, 2014. In addition, the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, The Ontario
Knife Company (OKC) also entered into a separate Loan Agreement with the Bank on December 1, 2014. The OKC Loan Agreement provides
for a $2,000,000 seven-year term loan (the  OKC Term Loan ). The proceeds from the OKC Term Loan are being used to
purchase equipment and expand/renovate the OKC facility in Franklinville, New York. 

Borrowings
under these Credit Facilities bear interest, at the Company s option, at the Bank s Prime Rate or LIBOR plus 1.4%.
Principal installments are payable on the Term Loan and the OKC Term Loan through December 1, 2021 with a balloon payment of $786,000
at maturity of the Term Loan. 

The Company
believes its cash generating capability and financial condition, together with available credit facilities will be adequate to
meet our operating, investing and financing needs.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

In addition to historical information,

performed under fixed price contracts and the following factors, among others discussed herein, could cause actual results and
future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements: uncertainties in today s
global economy and global competition, and difficulty in predicting defense appropriations, the vitality of the commercial aviation
industry and its ability to purchase new aircraft, the willingness and ability of the Company s customers to fund long-term
purchase programs, and market demand and acceptance both for the Company s products and its customers  products which
incorporate Company-made components. The success of the Company also depends upon the trends of the economy, including interest
rates, income tax laws, governmental regulation, legislation, population changes and those risk factors discussed elsewhere in
