      Table of Contents           AGRO CAPITAL MANAGEMENT CORP.    fka GUATE TOURISM INC.     NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     September 30, 2016         NOTE 1       ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS      Agro Capital Management Corp. (the  Company ) registered as Guate Tourism Inc. in the State of Nevada on November 12, 2013 and was formed to promote tourism in Guatemala.     On September 11, 2015, the major shareholder of the Company sold 6,000,000 common shares owned by her to unrelated 3 rd  parties. These 6,000,000 common shares represent 82.8% of common stock of the Company. As a result, the Company changed control on September 11, 2015.     On October 29, 2015, the Company filed Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada whereby the Company conducted a statutory merger with its wholly-owned subsidiary Agro Capital Management Corp., which was incorporated on October 29, 2015 and changed its name in connection therewith to  Agro Capital Management Corp .     In connection therewith the Company also amended its Articles of Incorporation to (i) increase the Company s authorized number of shares of common stock from 75,000,000 to 300,000,000 and (ii) increase the Company s total issued and outstanding shares of common stock by conducting a forward split of such shares at the rate of ten (10) shares for every one (1) share currently issued and outstanding (the  Forward Split ).     On December 11, 2015, the name change and Forward Split were effected in the market by Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ). The Company s ticker symbol became  ACMB .     The financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the 10 for 1 forward split.      NOTE 2       SUMMARY OF SIGNIFCANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES       Basis of Presentation      The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and accounting principles generally accepted ("GAAP") in the United States of America. The accompanying interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the Company's opinion, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the nine months September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. While management of the Company believes that the disclosures presented herein are adequate and not misleading, these interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the footnotes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015 contained in the Company's Form 10-K.      Use of Estimates      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.                  F-4       
      Table of Contents           Recent Accounting Pronouncements      Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued since the last audit of our financial statements. The Company's management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.      NOTE 3   GOING CONCERN      The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern.  However, the Company had no revenues from the inception through September 30, 2016.  The Company currently has limited working capital, and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time.      Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses. The Company intends to position itself so that it may be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of management s efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern.     These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the company cannot continue in existence.      NOTE 4   RELATED PARTIES TRANSACTIONS      In support of the Company's efforts and cash requirements, it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the Company can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment for continued support by shareholders or directors. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances were considered temporary in nature and were not formalized by a promissory note.     During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, one of the Company s shareholders paid on behalf of the Company an amount of $24,374. As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the Company owed $73,448 and $49,074 to this shareholder, respectively.       NOTE 5   PREPAID EXPENSES       Prepaid expenses consist of regulatory fees paid in advance, and prepayment for services. Prepaid expenses are amortized as the related expense is incurred.                   F-5       
      Table of Contents           NOTE 6   COMMON STOCK      The Company has 300,000,000, $0.001 par value shares of common stock authorized.     No shares were issued during the nine month period ending September 30, 2016.     There were 72,500,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015.      NOTE 7   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES      The Company neither owns nor leases any real or personal property. An officer has provided office services without charge. There is no obligation for the officer to continue this arrangement. Such costs are immaterial to the financial statements and accordingly are not reflected herein. The officers and directors are involved in other business activities and most likely will become involved in other business activities in the future.     The Company has no commitments or contingencies as of September 30, 2016.     From time to time the Company may become a party to litigation matters involving claims against the Company. Management believes that it is adequately insured for its operations and there are no current matters that would have a material effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.      NOTE 8   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS      The Company s management has evaluated subsequent events through the date that the financial statements were, issued, October 27, 2016 and determined that no other significant events have occurred since September 30, 2016.                   F-6       
      Table of Contents          FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS     Statements made in this Form 10-Q that are not historical or current facts are "forward-looking statements". These statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "approximate" or "continue," or the negative thereof. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.        ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION        Agro Capital Management Corp. ( Agro Capital  or the  Company ) formerly known as Guate Tourism Inc., was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 12, 2013. Until September 11, 2015, the Company operated as an online tourist guide company in Guatemala helping public from all over the world to find the best accommodation/restaurant/tour/city/program etc. depending on their budget and interests. On September 11, 2015, the Company underwent a change of control, which was the result of the Company s largest shareholder, Ms. Blanca Bamaca, resigning as an officer and director and selling in a private transaction 6 million shares of the Company s common stock, which represented 82.8% of the Company s issued and outstanding shares of common stock.     On December 31, 2015, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement whereby it agreed to issue 30 million shares of its common stock in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of Agro Capital Management Berhad, a Malaysian corporation (the  Agro Malay ). The Company closed its acquisition of the Agro Malay on April 30, 2016. Effective September 19, 2016, the Company rescinded the transactions under such Share Exchange Agreement. The Company and the owners of Agro Malay decided to unwind and rescind the transactions and share issuances pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement due to, among other reasons, the lack of currently available information regarding Agro Malay necessary for the Company to complete a full financial audit of Agro Malay for the two (2) prior fiscal years. As a result, the acquisition held little to no value for the Company s shareholders, including the owners of Agro Malay, who became shareholders of the Company as a result of such transaction. It therefore became mutually beneficial to all parties for the transactions to be rescinded and return each party to their former positions. In connection with the unwinding and rescission of the transactions under the Share Exchange Agreement, the shares of Agro Malay were returned to the owners and the Company s 30 million shares were returned to treasury.      EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS     At present, we have no employees other than our officer and director.  We presently do not have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt such plans in the future.  There are presently no personal benefits available to any officers, directors or employees.       Results of Operation       Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation.     We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.                  3       
      Table of Contents            Three Month Periods Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and Nine Month Periods Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015       Our net loss for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $15,084 and $1,780, respectively.  Our net loss for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $46,203 and $15,544, respectively.  During these periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 we have not generated any revenue.       Liquidity and Capital Resources        Three Month Period Ended September 30, 2016        As at September 30, 2016, our total assets were $2,621, as compared to $15,445 as at December 31, 2015.  As at September 30, 2016, our current liabilities were $83,982 and stockholders  equity was $(81,361), compared to $50,603 and $(35,158) respectively as at December 31, 2015.        Cash Flows from Operating Activities       We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net cash flows used in operating activities was $39,764 and $15,139, respectively.       Cash Flows from Investing Activities       For the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 we do not have any net cash flows provided by investing activities.       Cash Flows from Financing Activities       For the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 net cash flows provided by financing activities was $24,374 and $6,046, respectively.         Plan of Operation and Funding       We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business.     Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next three months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of inventory; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. We will have to raise additional funds in the next twelve months in order to sustain and expand our operations. We currently do not have a specific plan of how we will obtain such funding; however, we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. We have and will continue to seek to obtain short-term loans from our directors, although no future arrangement for additional loans has been made. We do not have any agreements with our directors concerning these loans. We do not have any arrangements in place for any future equity financing.                  4       
      Table of Contents            Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements       As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.       Going Concern       The independent auditors' review report accompanying our December 30, 2015 financial statements contained an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared "assuming that we will continue as a going concern," which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.        ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.        No report required.        ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES        Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.     An evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Such officer also confirmed that there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.                 5
