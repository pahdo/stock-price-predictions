PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
   
  Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) 

This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based upon management s current expectations and are subject to significant uncertainties and changes in circumstances. Please review  MD A Forward-Looking Statements  for more information on the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ( this Report ). Our actual results may differ materially from those included in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, those described in  Part II Item 1A. Risk Factors  in this Report and in  Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K ( 2015 Form 10-K ). Unless otherwise specified, references to notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements as of   September 30, 2016   included in this Report. 

Management monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our business results and financial condition. The following MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes in this Report and the more detailed information contained in our   2015   Form 10-K. 
   
               INTRODUCTION 

We are a diversified financial services holding company with banking and non-banking subsidiaries. Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the  Company ) offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through branches, the internet and other distribution channels. As of   September 30, 2016  , our principal subsidiaries included: 
             
    Capital One Bank (USA), National Association ( COBNA ), which offers credit and debit card products, other lending products and deposit products; and 
                
    Capital One, National Association ( CONA ), which offers a broad spectrum of banking products and financial services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients. 
     The Company is hereafter collectively referred to as  we,   us  or  our.  COBNA and CONA are collectively referred to as the  Banks.  Certain business terms used in this document are defined in the  MD A Glossary and Acronyms  and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this Report. 
  Our consolidated total net revenues are derived primarily from lending to consumer and commercial customers net of funding costs associated with interest on deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt. We also earn non-interest income which primarily consists of interchange income net of rewards expenses and service charges and other customer-related fees. Our expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating expenses, marketing expenses and income taxes. 
  Our principal operations are currently organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group, are included in the Other category. 
             
    Credit Card:   Consists of our domestic consumer and small business card lending, national closed-end installment lending and the international card lending businesses in Canada and the United Kingdom ( U.K. ). 
                
    Consumer Banking:   Consists of our branch-based lending and deposit gathering activities for consumers and small businesses, national deposit gathering, auto lending and consumer home loan lending and servicing activities. 
                
    Commercial Banking:   Consists of our lending, deposit gathering and servicing activities provided to commercial real estate and commercial and industrial customers. Our commercial and industrial customers typically include companies with annual revenues between $10 million and $1 billion.

Recent Acquisitions and Dispositions 
  We regularly explore and evaluate opportunities to acquire financial services and financial assets, including credit card and other loan portfolios, and enter into strategic partnerships as part of our growth strategy. We also explore opportunities to acquire digital companies and related assets to improve our information technology infrastructure and to deliver on our digital strategy. We also regularly consider the potential disposition of certain of our assets, branches, partnership agreements or lines of businesses. We may issue equity or debt in connection with acquisitions, including public offerings, to fund such acquisitions.  
  On October 3, 2016, we announced that we have entered into a 10-year program agreement to become the exclusive issuing partner of co-branded credit cards to Cabela s customers. In connection with this credit card program, we have entered into a definitive agreement under which we will acquire the credit card operations from Cabela s, including approximately $5.2 billion in credit card receivables and other assets and approximately $5.0 billion in associated funding liabilities. This transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of various regulatory approvals and the approval of the stockholders of Cabela s. In determining whether to approve the proposed acquisition, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) will consider, among other factors, the convenience and needs of the communities we serve and our effectiveness in combating money laundering, including the acceptability to the OCC of our progress in addressing the requirements of the consent order with the OCC that we previously disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2015. We cannot be certain when or if, or on what terms and conditions, required regulatory approvals will be granted to complete the acquisition. 
  On December 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the Healthcare Financial Services business of General Electric Capital Corporation ( HFS acquisition ). During the second quarter of 2016, we finalized purchase accounting for the HFS acquisition, and recognized approximately $9.2 billion in assets, including $8.2 billion of loans. See    Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    of this Report and    Note 2 Business Developments    in our   2015   Form 10-K for additional information. 
  We had no significant acquisitions or dispositions in   the first nine months of 2016  .

SUMMARY OF SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA 

The following table presents selected consolidated financial data from our results of operations for   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016   and   2015   and selected comparative balance sheet data as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . We also provide selected key metrics we use in evaluating our performance including certain metrics that are computed using non-GAAP measures. We believe these non-GAAP metrics provide useful insight to investors and users of our financial information in assessing the results of the Company.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK 

We reported net income of   $1.0 billion   (  $1.90   per diluted common share) on total net revenue of   $6.5 billion   and net income of   $3.0 billion   (  $5.42   per diluted common share) on total net revenue of   $18.9 billion   for   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016  , respectively. In comparison, we reported net income of   $1.1 billion   (  $1.98   per diluted common share) on total net revenue of   $5.9 billion   and net income of   $3.1 billion   (  $5.48   per diluted common share) on total net revenue of   $17.2 billion   for   the third quarter and first nine months of 2015  , respectively.  
  Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio as calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach including transition provisions was   10.6%   and   11.1%   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. See  MD A   Capital Management    below for additional information. 
  On June 29, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of shares of our common stock ( 2016 Stock Repurchase Program ) from the third quarter of 2016 through the end of the second quarter of 2017. Through the end of the third quarter of 2016, we repurchased approximately $1.2 billion of common stock as part of the 2016 Stock Repurchase Program and expect to complete the 2016 Stock Repurchase Program by the end of the second quarter of 2017. See  MD A   Capital Management    below for additional information. 
  Below are additional highlights of our performance in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016  . These highlights are generally based on a comparison between the results of   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016   and   2015  , except as otherwise noted. The changes in our financial condition and credit performance are generally based on our financial condition and credit performance as of   September 30, 2016   compared to our financial condition and credit performance as of   December 31, 2015  . We provide a more detailed discussion of our financial performance in the sections following this    Executive Summary and Business Outlook  .  
  Total Company Performance 
               
    Earnings:   Our net income   decreased   by   $109 million   to   $1.0 billion   in   the third quarter of 2016  , compared to   the third quarter of 2015  , and   decreased   by   $170 million   to   $3.0 billion   in   the first nine months of 2016  , compared to   the first nine months of 2015  . The decreases were primarily due to (i) higher provision for credit losses driven by higher charge-offs in our credit card, taxi medallion, and oil and gas lending portfolios, as well as a larger allowance build in our credit card loan portfolio; and (ii)   higher operating expenses associated with loan growth and continued investments in technology and infrastructure  . These higher expenses were partially offset by (i) higher interest income due to growth in our credit card and commercial loan portfolios; and (ii) higher non-interest income attributable to higher net interchange fees driven by higher purchase volume, partially offset by lower service charges and other customer-related fees primarily due to the   exit of our legacy payment protection products in our Domestic Card business during the first quarter of 2016  . 
                  
    Loans Held for Investment:   Loans held for investment   increased   by   $8.2 billion   to   $238.0 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   from   December 31, 2015     primarily driven by growth in our auto, commercial and credit card loan portfolios, partially offset by the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio and seasonal paydowns in our credit card loan portfolio  . Average loans held for investment   increased   by   $24.6 billion   to   $235.8 billion   in   the third quarter of 2016   compared to   the third quarter of 2015  , and   increased   by   $23.4 billion   to   $231.0 billion   in   the first nine months of 2016   compared to   the first nine months of 2015  ,   primarily driven by continued growth in our commercial, credit card and auto loan portfolios, including loans acquired from the HFS acquisition, partially offset by the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio. 
                  
    Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics:   Our net charge-off rate   increased   by   41   basis points to   2.10%   in   the third quarter of 2016   compared to   the third quarter of 2015  , and   increased   by   38   basis points to   2.06%   in   the first nine months of 2016   compared to   the first nine months of 2015  , primarily due to growth and seasoning of recent credit card loan originations and rising losses in our taxi medallion and oil and gas lending portfolios within our Commercial Banking business. Our 30+ day delinquency rate   increased   by   4   basis points to   3.04%   as of   September 30, 2016   from   December 31, 2015  , primarily due to higher delinquencies resulting from recent growth and seasoning of credit card loan originations, partially offset by continued growth in our domestic card and auto loan portfolios. We provide additional information on our credit quality metrics below under  MD A   Business Segment Financial Performance    and  MD A    Credit Risk Profile  .

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses:   Our allowance for loan and lease losses   increased   by   $1.1 billion   to   $6.3 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   from   December 31, 2015  , and the allowance coverage ratio   increased   by   40   basis points to   2.63%   as of   September 30, 2016   from   December 31, 2015  .   The increases were primarily driven by (i) a higher domestic card allowance due to continued portfolio growth, the effects of growth and subprime mix, and slightly higher expected credit losses in 2017 for portions of our credit card portfolio collectively leading to an increased overall loss rate; (ii) continued adverse industry conditions impacting our taxi medallion and oil and gas lending portfolios in our Commercial Banking business; and (iii) continued auto loan growth and the effects of growth leading to an increased overall loss rate  .

Business Segment Financial Performance 
  Table   2   summarizes our business segment results, which we report based on revenue and income from continuing operations, net of tax, for   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016   and   2015  . We provide information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in  Note 20 Business Segments  in our   2015   Form 10-K. We also provide a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our consolidated generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) results in    Note 13 Business Segments    of this Report. 
    
  Table   2  :   Business Segment Results    

__________ 
            (1)   
    Total net revenue (loss) consists of net interest income and non-interest income. 
               (2)   
    Net income (loss) for our business segments and the Other category is based on income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax. 
               (3)   
    Some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits. Accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory tax rate of 35% with offsetting reclassifications to the Other category.    
               (4)   
    Includes the residual impact of the allocation of our centralized Corporate Treasury group activities, unallocated corporate expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments and other items as described in  Note 20 Business Segments  in our   2015   Form 10-K. 
      
  Credit Card:   Our Credit Card business generated net income from continuing operations of   $555 million   and   $1.6 billion   in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016  , respectively, compared to net income from continuing operations of   $670 million   and   $1.8 billion   in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2015  , respectively. The decreases in net income were primarily due to     (i) higher provision for credit losses driven by higher charge-offs due to continued loan growth and portfolio seasoning, and a larger allowance build   due to continued portfolio growth, the effects of growth and subprime mix, and slightly higher expected credit losses in 2017 for portions of our credit card portfolio collectively leading to an increased overall loss rate  ; (ii) higher operating expenses associated with loan growth as well as continuing digital investments; and (iii) lower service charges and other customer-related fees primarily due to the   exit of our legacy payment protection products in our Domestic Card business during the first quarter of 2016  . These drivers were partially offset by higher net interest income primarily driven by loan growth, and an increase in interchange fees driven by higher purchase volume, net of rewards expense from the continued expansion of our rewards franchise and adjustments to our customer rewards liability. Period-end loans held for investment   increased   by   $3.1 billion   to   $99.2 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   from   December 31, 2015  , primarily due to   continued loan growth in our Domestic Card business  .

Consumer Banking:   Our Consumer Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of   $244 million   and   $750 million   in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016  , respectively, compared to net income from continuing operations of   $273 million   and   $830 million   in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2015  , respectively. The decreases in net income were primarily attributable to (i) higher provision for credit losses   primarily driven by a larger allowance build in our auto loan portfolio due to continued loan growth, as well as higher charge-offs  ; and (ii)   higher operating expenses driven by growth in our auto loan portfolio and increased marketing expenses  . These drivers were partially offset by higher revenue primarily attributable to growth in our auto loan portfolio. Period-end loans held for investment   increased   by   $1.9 billion   to   $72.3 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   from   December 31, 2015  , driven by growth in our auto loan portfolio, partially offset by the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio. 
  Commercial Banking:   Our Commercial Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of   $191 million   and   $396 million   in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016  , respectively, compared to net income from continuing operations of   $137 million   and   $464 million   in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2015  , respectively. The increase in net income in   the third quarter of 2016   was primarily attributable to (i) higher revenue driven by   loan growth, including loans acquired in the HFS acquisition  ; and (ii) lower provision for credit losses primarily driven by   lower exposure reducing our reserve for unfunded lending commitments, while higher charge-offs in our taxi medallion and oil and gas lending portfolios drove a corresponding allowance reduction  . These were partially offset by higher operating expenses due to costs associated with the HFS acquisition and continued growth in our Commercial Banking business. The decrease in net income in   the first nine months of 2016   was primarily attributable to (i) higher provision for credit losses due to higher charge-offs and a larger allowance build, both a result of continued adverse industry conditions impacting our taxi medallion and oil and gas lending portfolios; and (ii) higher operating expenses due to costs associated with the HFS acquisition and continued growth in our Commercial Banking business. These expenses were partially offset by higher net interest income driven by   loan growth, including loans acquired in the HFS acquisition  . Period-end loans held for investment   increased   by   $3.2 billion   to   $66.5 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   from   December 31, 2015  , driven by growth in our commercial loan portfolios. 
   
  Business Outlook  
  We discuss below our current expectations regarding our total company performance and the performance of each of our business segments over the near-term based on market conditions, the regulatory environment and our business strategies as of the time we filed this Report. The statements contained in this section are based on our current expectations regarding our outlook for our financial results and business strategies. Our expectations take into account, and should be read in conjunction with, our expectations regarding economic trends and analysis of our business as discussed in  Part I Item 1. Business  and  MD A  in our   2015   Form 10-K. Certain statements are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise disclosed, forward-looking statements do not reflect (i) any change in current dividend or repurchase strategies; (ii) the effect of any acquisitions, divestitures or similar transactions that have not been previously disclosed; or (iii) any changes in laws, regulations or regulatory interpretations, in each case after the date as of which such statements are made. See  MD A Forward-Looking Statements  in this Report for more information on the forward-looking statements included in this Report and  Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our   2015   Form 10-K for factors that could materially influence our results.  
  Total Company Expectations 
  We believe we are positioned to deliver attractive shareholder returns over the long term, driven by growth and sustainable returns at the higher end of banks, as well as significant capital distribution, subject to regulatory approval.  
  We have improved efficiency by growing revenues and tightly managing costs across the company, realizing analog cost savings and other efficiency gains as we become more digital. Even with the expected significant seasonal increase in non-interest expenses in the fourth quarter, we expect that our full-year 2016 efficiency ratio, excluding adjusting items, will be substantially lower than full-year 2015. We expect that our near-term annual efficiency ratio, excluding adjusting items, will be in the 52%s, with a reasonable margin of volatility. Over the longer term, we continue to believe that we should achieve gradual efficiency improvement, driven by growth and productivity gains. 
  Changing customer needs and preferences in our retail deposit businesses are driving changes to the function, format and number of our branches. Like many banks, we have been optimizing the format and number of our branches to better meet our evolving customer needs. Year-to-date, we have recognized approximately   $106 million   of the   $160 million   in expected costs for 2016. The majority of these costs appear in the  Other  category. We expect bank optimization costs to continue in 2017.

We believe our actions have created a well-positioned balance sheet with strong capital and liquidity. Pursuant to our approved   2016   capital plan, our board has authorized repurchases of up to $2.5 billion of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2017. We reduced our net share count by   17   million shares in the third quarter of 2016. The timing and exact amount of any common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including market conditions, opportunities for growth, utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time. See  MD A Capital Management Dividend Policy and Stock Purchases  for more information. 
  Business Segment Expectations 
  Credit Card  : In our Domestic Card business, we expect the full-year 2016 charge-off rate to be around 4.15%. We expect the full-year 2017 charge-off rate will be in the mid-four percent range, with quarterly seasonal variability. Loan growth coupled with our expectations for a rising charge-off rate drove an allowance build in the current quarter, and we expect these same factors to drive allowance additions going forward. The impact of the upward pressure on delinquencies and charge-offs as new loans season and become a larger portion of our overall portfolio is expected to peak in 2016 and have a diminishing effect in 2017 and only a modest effect beyond that. 
  Consumer Banking  : In our Consumer Banking business, we expect that decreasing margins and modestly rising charge-offs in the auto finance business, as well as continued planned mortgage run-off in our acquired home loan portfolio will negatively affect Consumer Banking revenues, efficiency ratio and net income, even as we continue to tightly manage costs. 
  Commercial Banking  : We have experienced increases in average loans and average deposits year-over-year in our Commercial Banking business. Credit pressures continue to be focused in our oil and gas and taxi medallion lending portfolios. 
   
               CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses on the consolidated financial statements. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We provide a summary of our significant accounting policies under    Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    in our 2015 Form 10-K. 
  We have identified the following accounting policies as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. These critical accounting policies govern: 
             
    Loan loss reserves 
                
    Asset impairment 
                
    Fair value of financial instruments 
                
    Representation and warranty reserves 
                
    Customer rewards reserves 
     We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them, as necessary, based on changing conditions. Management has discussed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since the 2015 Form 10-K. 
  We provide additional information on our critical accounting policies and estimates under  MD A Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  in our 2015 Form 10-K. 
   
               ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND DEVELOPMENTS 

See    Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    for information on accounting standards adopted in 2016, as well as recently issued accounting standards not yet required to be adopted and the expected impact of these changes in accounting standards.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The section below provides a comparative discussion of our consolidated financial performance for   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016   and   2015  . Following this section, we provide a discussion of our business segment results. You should read this section together with our  MD A   Executive Summary and Business Outlook  ,  where we discuss trends and other factors that we expect will affect our future results of operations. 
   
  Net Interest Income 
  Net interest income represents the difference between the interest income, including certain fees, earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense on our interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities and other interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, and other borrowings. Generally, we include in interest income any past due fees on loans that we deem collectible. Our net interest margin, based on our consolidated results, represents the difference between the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, including the notional impact of non-interest-bearing funding. We expect net interest income and our net interest margin to fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.

            (1)    
    Past due fees included in interest income totaled approximately   $390 million   and   $1.1 billion   in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016  , respectively, and   $373 million   and   $1.1 billion   in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2015  , respectively. 
               (2)   
    Interest income and interest expense and the calculation of average yields on interest-earning assets and average rates on interest-bearing liabilities include the impact of hedge accounting. 
               (3)   
    Some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits. Accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory rate of 35% with offsetting reclassifications to the Other category.

Net interest income   increased   by   $517 million   to   $5.3 billion   in   the third quarter of 2016   compared to   the third quarter of 2015  , and   increased   by   $1.6 billion   to   $15.4 billion   in   the first nine months of 2016   compared to   the first nine months of 2015  , primarily driven by growth in our credit card and commercial loan portfolios, including loans acquired from the HFS acquisition. Net interest margin   increased   by   6   basis points to   6.79%   in   the third quarter of 2016   and   increased   by   14   basis points to   6.76%   in   the first nine months of 2016  , primarily driven by continued growth in our credit card loan portfolio and the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio in our Consumer Banking business, partially offset by (i) the impact of loans acquired from the HFS acquisition in our Commercial Banking business, which generally have lower net interest margins compared to our total company portfolio and (ii) margin compression in our auto loan portfolio. 
   
  Table   4   displays the change in our net interest income between periods and the extent to which the variance is attributable to (i) changes in the volume of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; or (ii) changes in the interest rates related to these assets and liabilities. 
  Table   4  :   Rate/Volume Analysis of Net Interest Income   (1)       
  __________ 
            (1)   
    We calculate the change in interest income and interest expense separately for each item. The portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate is allocated proportionately when the calculation results in a positive value. When the portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate results in a negative value, the total amount is allocated to volume or rate, depending on which amount is positive. 
               (2)   
    Some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits. Accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory rate of 35% with offsetting reclassifications to the Other category. 
      
  Non-Interest Income 
  Non-interest income primarily consists of interchange fees net of rewards expense, service charges and other customer-related fees and other non-interest income. Other non-interest income includes the pre-tax net benefit (provision) for mortgage representation and warranty losses related to continuing operations, gains and losses from the sale of investment securities, gains and losses on derivatives not accounted for in hedge accounting relationships and hedge ineffectiveness.

For the total impact to the net benefit (provision) for mortgage representation and warranty losses, including the portion recognized in our consolidated statements of income as a component of discontinued operations, see  MD A   Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis   Table   14   Changes in Representation and Warranty Reserve.  
     Non-interest income   increased   by   $44 million   to   $1.2 billion   in   the third quarter of 2016   compared to   the third quarter of 2015  , and   increased   by   $163 million   to   $3.5 billion   in   the first nine months of 2016   compared to   the first nine months of 2015  , primarily driven by an increase in interchange fees driven by higher purchase volume in our Credit Card business, net of rewards expense from the continued expansion of our rewards franchise and adjustments to our customer rewards liability, partially offset by lower service charges and other customer-related fees primarily due to the   exit of our legacy payment protection products in our Domestic Card business during the first quarter of 2016  . 
   
  Provision for Credit Losses 
  Our provision for credit losses in each period is driven by net charge-offs, changes to the allowance for loan and lease losses and changes to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. We recorded a provision for credit losses of   $1.6 billion   and   $4.7 billion   in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016  , respectively, compared to   $1.1 billion   and   $3.2 billion   in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2015  , respectively. The provision for credit losses as a percentage of net interest income was   30.1%   and   30.5%   in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016  , respectively, compared to   22.9%   and   22.7%   in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2015  , respectively. 
  The increase in the provision for credit losses in   the third quarter of 2016   compared to   the third quarter of 2015   was primarily driven by higher charge-offs as well as a larger allowance build in our credit card loan portfolio   due to continued portfolio growth, the effects of growth and subprime mix, and slightly higher expected credit losses in 2017 for portions of our credit card portfolio collectively leading to an increased overall loss rate  . The increase in provision in   the first nine months of 2016   compared to   the first nine months of 2015   was primarily driven by (i) higher charge-offs as well as a larger allowance build in our credit card loan portfolio   due to continued portfolio growth, the effects of growth and subprime mix, and slightly higher expected credit losses in 2017 for portions of our credit card portfolio collectively leading to an increased overall loss rate  ; and (ii) higher charge-offs and a larger allowance build in our commercial loan portfolio as a result of continued adverse industry conditions impacting our taxi medallion and oil and gas lending portfolios. 
  We provide additional information on the provision for credit losses and changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses within  MD A Credit Risk Profile Summary of Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses,     Note 4 Loans    and    Note 5 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments  .

Non-Interest Expense 
  Non-interest expense consists of ongoing operating expenses, such as salaries and associate benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, professional services, communications and data processing expenses and other non-interest expenses, as well as marketing costs and amortization of intangibles. 
  Table   6   displays the components of non-interest expense for   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016   and   2015  . 
  Table     6  :     Non-Interest Expense   

  Non-interest expense   increased   by   $201 million   to   $3.4 billion   in   the third quarter of 2016   compared to   the third quarter of 2015  , and   increased   by   $363 million   to   $9.9 billion   in   the first nine months of 2016   compared to   the first nine months of 2015  , primarily due to   higher operating expenses associated with loan growth and continued investments in technology and infrastructure  , as well as higher Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) surcharges and premiums. 
   
  Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax 
  Income (loss) from discontinued operations consists of results from the discontinued mortgage origination operations of our wholesale mortgage banking unit, GreenPoint Mortgage Funding Inc. ( GreenPoint ) and the discontinued manufactured housing operations of GreenPoint Credit, LLC, a subsidiary of GreenPoint, both of which were acquired as part of the North Fork Bancorporation, Inc. ( North Fork ) acquisition in December 2006. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was   $11 million   and   $17 million   in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016  , respectively, compared to loss of $4 million and income of $26 million in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2015  , respectively. We recorded a provision net of tax for mortgage representation and warranty reserve of   $11 million   (  $18 million   before tax) and   $14 million   (  $23 million   before tax) in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016  , respectively, compared to a provision net of tax of $2 million ($3 million before tax) and a benefit net of tax of $27 million ($43 million before tax) in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2015  , respectively. 
  We provide additional information on the discontinued operations in    Note 2 Discontinued Operations    and on the net benefit (provision) for mortgage representation and warranty losses and the related reserve for representation and warranty claims in  MD A   Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis   Mortgage Representation and Warranty Reserve  and    Note 14 Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others  .  
   
  Income Taxes 
  We recorded income tax provisions of   $496 million   (  32.8%   effective income tax rate) and $  1.4 billion   (  31.5%   effective income tax rate) in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016  , respectively, compared to $  530 million   (32.2% effective income tax rate) and   $1.4 billion   (31.7% effective income tax rate) in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2015  , respectively. Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations varies between periods due, in part, to fluctuations in our pre-tax earnings, which affects the relative tax benefit of tax-exempt income, tax credits and other permanent tax items.

The increase in our effective income tax rate in the third quarter of 2016, compared to the third quarter of 2015, was primarily due to a reduced benefit of lower taxed foreign earnings and an increase in discrete tax expense, partially offset by an increased relative benefit of tax exempt income and tax credits. The decrease in our effective income tax rate in the first nine months of 2016, compared to the first nine months of 2015, was primarily due to an increased relative benefit of tax exempt income and tax credits, largely offset by a reduced benefit of lower taxed foreign earnings and an increase in discrete tax expense.

BUSINESS SEGMENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 

Our principal operations are currently organized into three major business segments, which are defined based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group, are included in the Other category. 
  The results of our individual businesses, which we report on a continuing operations basis, reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. We provide additional information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in  Note 20 Business Segments  in our   2015   Form 10-K. 
  We refer to the business segment results derived from our internal management accounting and reporting process as our  managed  presentation, which differs in some cases from our reported results prepared based on U.S. GAAP. There is no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to U.S. GAAP; therefore, the managed presentation of our business segment results may not be comparable to similar information provided by other financial services companies. In addition, our individual business segment results should not be used as a substitute for comparable results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
  Below we summarize our business segment results for   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016   and   2015   and provide a comparative discussion of these results. We also discuss changes in our financial condition and credit performance metrics as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   December 31, 2015  . We provide a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated results in    Note 13 Business Segments  .  Additionally, we provide information on the outlook for each of our business segments as described above under  MD A   Executive Summary and Business Outlook  .  
   
  Credit Card Business 
  The primary sources of revenue for our Credit Card business are interest income, net interchange income and fees collected from customers. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs and marketing expenses. 
  Our Credit Card business generated net income from continuing operations of   $555 million   and   $1.6 billion   in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016  , respectively, and   $670 million   and   $1.8 billion   in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2015  , respectively.

Key factors affecting the results of our Credit Card business for   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016  , compared to   the third quarter and first nine months of 2015  , and changes in financial condition and credit performance between   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   include the following: 
             
    Net Interest Income:   Net interest income   increased   by   $338 million   to   $3.2 billion   in   the third quarter of 2016  , and   increased   by   $1.1 billion   to   $9.3 billion   in   the first nine months of 2016  , primarily driven by loan growth in our Domestic Card business. 
                
    Non-Interest Income:   Non-interest income was slightly lower at   $825 million   and was substantially flat at   $2.5 billion   in   the third quarter of 2016   and   the first nine months of 2016  , respectively, as an increase in interchange fees driven by higher purchase volume was largely offset by (i) higher rewards expense from the continued expansion of our rewards franchise and adjustments to our customer rewards liability; and (ii) lower service charges and other customer-related fees primarily due to the   exit of our legacy payment protection products in our Domestic Card business during the first quarter of 2016  . 
                
    Provision for Credit Losses:   The provision for credit losses   increased   by   $441 million   to   $1.3 billion   in   the third quarter of 2016  , and   increased   by   $1.2 billion   to   $3.6 billion   in   the first nine months of 2016  , primarily driven by higher charge-offs due to continued loan growth and portfolio seasoning, and a larger allowance build   due to continued portfolio growth, the effects of growth and subprime mix, and slightly higher expected credit losses in 2017 for portions of our credit card portfolio collectively leading to an increased overall loss rate  .  
                
    Non-Interest Expense:   Non-interest expense   increased   by   $36 million   to   $1.9 billion   in   the third quarter of 2016  , and   increased   by   $149 million   to   $5.6 billion   in   the first nine months of 2016  . The increase in   the third quarter of 2016   was primarily attributable to higher operating expenses associated with loan growth as well as continuing digital investments, partially offset by operating efficiencies and lower marketing expenses. The increase in   the first nine months of 2016   was primarily attributable to higher operating expenses associated with loan growth as well as continuing digital investments, partially offset by operating efficiencies and smaller builds in our U.K. Payment Protection Insurance Reserve ( PPI ) recorded in   the first nine months of 2016   compared to   the first nine months of 2015  . 
                
    Loans Held for Investment:   Period-end loans held for investment   increased   by   $3.1 billion   to   $99.2 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   from   December 31, 2015  , primarily due to   continued loan growth in our Domestic Card business  , net of expected seasonal paydowns. Average loans held for investment   increased   by   $9.6 billion   to   $98.0 billion   in   the third quarter of 2016   compared to   the third quarter of 2015  , and   increased   by   $10.1 billion   to   $95.1 billion   in   the first nine months of 2016   compared to   the first nine months of 2015  , primarily due to growth across our domestic and international card loan portfolios, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates in our international card loan portfolio driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in   the first nine months of 2016  . 
       
  Domestic Card Business 
  Domestic Card generated net income from continuing operations of   $527 million   and   $1.6 billion   in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016  , respectively, compared to net income from continuing operations of   $639 million   and   $1.7 billion   in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2015  , respectively. Over   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016   as well as   the third quarter and first nine months of 2015  , Domestic Card accounted for greater than 90% of total net revenues of our Credit Card business, and greater than 90% of net income of our Credit Card business.

    Calculated by dividing the   period-end allowance for loan and lease losses   by period-end loans held for investment. 
     Because our Domestic Card business accounts for the substantial majority of our Credit Card business, the key factors driving the results are similar to the key factors affecting our total Credit Card business. Net income for our Domestic Card business   decreased   in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016   compared to   the third quarter and first nine months of 2015  , primarily driven by higher provision for credit losses and higher operating expenses associated with continued loan growth, partially offset by higher net interest income resulting from loan growth.

International Card Business 
  International Card generated net income from continuing operations of   $28 million   and   $94 million   in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016  , respectively, compared to net income from continuing operations of   $31 million   and   $83 million   in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2015  , respectively. Net income was substantially flat in   the third quarter of 2016   as lower operating and marketing expenses as well as a smaller build in our U.K. PPI Reserve in   the third quarter of 2016   were offset by (i) an increase in the provision for credit losses due to higher charge-offs and an allowance build in   the third quarter of 2016   compared to an allowance release in   the third quarter of 2015  ; and (ii) the impact of foreign exchange rates driven by strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The increase in net income over   the first nine months of 2016   was primarily attributable to (i) higher net interest income resulting from loan growth and higher loan yield due to changes in the product mix of the portfolio; (ii) smaller builds in our U.K. PPI Reserve in   the first nine months of 2016   compared to   the first nine months of 2015  , which impacted both revenue and non-interest expense; and (iii) a gain recorded in the second quarter of 2016 related to the exchange of our ownership interest in Visa Europe with Visa Inc. as a result of Visa Inc. s acquisition of Visa Europe. These drivers were partially offset by (i) higher provision for credit losses due to higher charge-offs and an allowance build during   the first nine months of 2016   compared to an allowance release in   the first nine months of 2015  ; and (ii) the impact of foreign exchange rates driven by strengthening of the U.S. dollar in   the first nine months of 2016  .

  The primary sources of revenue for our Consumer Banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits and non-interest income from service charges and customer-related fees. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs and marketing expenses. 
  Our Consumer Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of   $244 million   and   $750 million   in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016  , respectively, and   $273 million   and   $830 million   in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2015  , respectively.

      Key factors affecting the results of our Consumer Banking business for   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016  , compared to   the third quarter and first nine months of 2015  , and changes in financial condition and credit performance between   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   include the following: 
             
    Net Interest Income:   Net interest income   increased   by   $29 million   to   $1.5 billion   in   the third quarter of 2016   and was substantially flat at   $4.3 billion   in   the first nine months of 2016   as growth in our auto loan portfolio was largely offset by the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio and margin compression in our auto loan portfolio. 
     Consumer Banking loan yield   increased   by   16   basis points to   6.4%   and   increased   by   3   basis points to   6.3%   in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016  , respectively, compared to   the third quarter and first nine months of 2015  . The increases were primarily driven by changes in the product mix in Consumer Banking as a result of the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio and growth in our auto loan portfolio, partially offset by declining yield in our auto loan portfolio. Average yield on auto loans   decreased   by   26   basis points and   39   basis points to   7.7%   in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016  , respectively. These decreases were primarily attributable to (i) a higher proportion of prime auto loans in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016   compared to   the third quarter and first nine months of 2015  ; and (ii) continued competition that drove margin compression across the auto business. The average yield on the home loan portfolio   increased   by   22   basis points to   4.0%   and   increased   by   3   basis points to   3.9%   in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016  , respectively.

Non-Interest Income:   Non-interest income   increased   by   $27 million   to   $201 million   in   the third quarter of 2016  , primarily attributable to an   increase in mortgage banking revenue  . Non-interest income   increased   by   $39 million   to   $567 million   in   the first nine months of 2016  , primarily due to customer rewards liability releases in the first nine months of 2016 within the retail banking business related to the discontinuation of certain debit card and deposit products. 
                  
    Provision for Credit Losses:   The provision for credit losses   increased   by   $68 million   to   $256 million   in   the third quarter of 2016  , and   increased   by   $111 million   to   $690 million   in   the first nine months of 2016  ,   primarily driven by a larger allowance build in our auto loan portfolio due to continued loan growth, as well as higher charge-offs  . 
                
    Non-Interest Expense:   Non-interest expense   increased   by   $33 million   to   $1.0 billion   in   the third quarter of 2016  , and   increased   by   $61 million   to   $3.0 billion   in   the first nine months of 2016  , primarily due to   higher operating expenses driven by growth in our auto loan portfolio and increased marketing expenses  . 
                
    Loans Held for Investment:   Period-end loans held for investment   increased   by   $1.9 billion   to   $72.3 billion   as of    September 30, 2016   from   December 31, 2015  , primarily due to growth in our auto loan portfolio, partially offset by the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio. Average loans held for investment   increased   by   $630 million   to   $71.7 billion   in   the third quarter of 2016   compared to   the third quarter of 2015   primarily due to growth in our auto loan portfolio, partially offset by the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio. Average loans held for investment   decreased   by   $294 million   to   $71.0 billion   in   the first nine months of 2016   compared to   the first nine months of 2015   primarily due to the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio, partially offset by growth in our auto loan portfolio. 
                  
    Deposits:   Period-end deposits   increased   by   $6.1 billion   to   $178.8 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   from   December 31, 2015  ,   as a result of our continued focus on deposit relationships with existing customers and our ability to attract new customers  . 
                  
    Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics:   The net charge-off rate   increased   by   12   basis points to   1.26%   in   the third quarter of 2016   compared to   the third quarter of 2015  , and   increased   by   11   basis points to   1.04%   in   the first nine months of 2016   compared to   the first nine months of 2015  . The increases in the net charge-off rate reflect the greater portion of auto loans in our total consumer banking loan portfolio, which generally have higher charge-off rates than other products within this portfolio. The 30+ day delinquency rate   decreased   by   41   basis points to   4.26%   as of   September 30, 2016   from   December 31, 2015  , primarily attributable to seasonally lower auto delinquency inventories. 
      
  Commercial Banking Business 
  The primary sources of revenue for our Commercial Banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits and non-interest income from customer fees and other transactions. Because we have some investments that generate tax-exempt income or tax credits, we make certain reclassifications to our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues on a taxable-equivalent basis. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs and marketing expenses. 
  Our Commercial Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of   $191 million   and   $396 million   in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016  , respectively, and   $137 million   and   $464 million   in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2015  , respectively.

    Some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits. Accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory tax rate of 35% with offsetting reclassifications to the Other category.    
               (2)   
    The provision for losses on unfunded lending commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income and the related reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our reserve for unfunded lending commitments totaled   $126 million   and   $161 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

     Key factors affecting the results of our Commercial Banking business for   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016  , compared to   the third quarter and first nine months of 2015  , and changes in financial condition and credit performance between   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   include the following: 
             
    Net Interest Income:   Net interest income   increased   by   $101 million   to   $555 million   in   the third quarter of 2016  , and   increased   by   $270 million   to   $1.7 billion   in   the first nine months of 2016  , primarily driven by   loan growth, including loans acquired in the HFS acquisition  . 
                
    Non-Interest Income:   Non-interest income   increased   by   $48 million   to   $156 million   in   the third quarter of 2016  , and   increased   by   $58 million   to   $403 million   in   the first nine months of 2016  , primarily driven by fee-based services and products attributable to our multifamily finance business. 
                
    Provision for Credit Losses:   The provision for credit losses   decreased   by   $14 million   to   $61 million   in   the third quarter of 2016  , primarily driven by   lower exposure reducing our reserve for unfunded lending commitments, while higher charge-offs in our taxi medallion and oil and gas lending portfolios drove a corresponding allowance reduction  . The provision for credit losses   increased   by   $233 million   to   $417 million   in   the first nine months of 2016  , primarily driven by higher charge-offs and a larger allowance build, both primarily due to continued adverse industry conditions impacting our taxi medallion and oil and gas lending portfolios. 
                
    Non-Interest Expense:   Non-i  nterest exp  ense   increased   by   $77 million   to   $349 million   in   the third quarter of 2016  , and   increased   by   $200 million   to   $1.0 billion   in   the first nine months of 2016  , driven by higher operating expenses due to costs associated with the HFS acquisition and continued growth in our Commercial Banking business. 
                  
    Net Charge-Off and Nonperforming Metrics:   The net charge-off rate   increased   by   40   basis points to   0.66%   in   the third quarter of 2016   compared to   the third quarter of 2015  , and   increased   by   33   basis points to   0.44%   in   the first nine months of 2016   compared to   the first nine months of 2015  , reflecting rising losses in our taxi medallion and oil and gas lending portfolios. Increased credit risk rating downgrades in these same lending portfolios resulted in the nonperforming loan rate increasing by   63   basis points to   1.50%   as of   September 30, 2016   from   December 31, 2015  .

  Other includes unallocated amounts related to our centralized Corporate Treasury group activities, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio, asset/liability management and certain capital management activities. Other also includes (i) foreign exchange-rate fluctuations on foreign currency-denominated balances; (ii) unallocated corporate expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance, such as certain acquisition and restructuring charges; (iii) a portion of the net benefit (provision) for representation and warranty losses related to continuing operations; and (iv) offsets related to certain line-item reclassifications.

 __________ 
            (1)   
    Some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits. Accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory tax rate of 35% with offsetting reclassifications to the Other category.    
              ** 
    Change is not meaningful. 
     Net income from continuing operations recorded in the Other category was   $26 million   and   $183 million   in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016  , respectively, compared to net income from continuing operations of   $38 million   and   $9 million   in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2015  , respectively. The increase in net income in the first nine months of 2016, compared to the first nine months of 2015, was primarily driven by (i) higher net interest income due to the impact of balance sheet growth and rates on our corporate investment portfolio revenue; and (ii)   lower restructuring charges for severance and related benefits pursuant to our ongoing benefit programs as a result of the realignment of our workforce  ; partially offset by (i) increased bank optimization charges; and (ii) a reduced income tax benefit as a result of higher income before taxes and increased discrete tax expense, partially offset by increased tax credits. 
   
               CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ANALYSIS 

Total assets increased by   $11.0 billion   to   $345.1 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   from   December 31, 2015   primarily attributable to an increase of   $8.2 billion   in loans held for investment   primarily driven by growth in our auto, commercial and credit card loan portfolios, partially offset by the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio and seasonal paydowns in our credit card loan portfolio  . Total liabilities   increased   by   $10.1 billion   to   $296.8 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  , primarily driven by an increase in deposits generated by our Consumer Banking business. Stockholders  equity   increased   by   $929 million   to   $48.2 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to our net income of   $3.0 billion   in   the first nine months of 2016   and   $737 million   of other comprehensive income, partially offset by   $2.8 billion   of share repurchases under our 2015 and 2016 Stock Repurchase Programs and dividend payments. 
  The following is a discussion of material changes in the major components of our assets and liabilities during   the first nine months of 2016  . Period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management activities that are intended to ensure the adequacy of capital while managing our liquidity requirements for the Company and our customers and our market risk exposure in accordance with our risk appetite. 
   
  Investment Securities 
  Our investment portfolio consists primarily of the following: U.S. Treasury securities; U.S. government-sponsored enterprise ( Agency ) and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities ( RMBS ) and commercial mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS  other asset-backed securities ( ABS  and other securities. The carrying value of our investments in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities represented     91%   and   90%   of our total investment securities portfolio as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

The fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio was   $41.5 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  , an   increase   of   $2.5 billion   from   December 31, 2015  . The fair value of our held to maturity securities portfolio was   $26.7 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  , an   increase   of   $1.4 billion   from   $25.3 billion   as of   December 31, 2015  . The   increase   in the fair value of both of these portfolios was primarily due to lower interest rates and growth in these portfolios as purchases outpaced maturities and paydowns. 
  Gross unrealized gains on our available for sale securities portfolio increased to   $883 million   as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   $578 million   as of   December 31, 2015   and gross unrealized losses on this portfolio decreased to   $101 million   as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   $321 million   as of   December 31, 2015  , both of which were primarily driven by a decrease in interest rates. Of the   $101 million   gross unrealized losses as of   September 30, 2016  ,   $71 million   was related to securities that had been in a loss position for 12 months or longer.

  Credit Ratings 
  Our portfolio of investment securities continues to be concentrated in securities that generally have high credit ratings and low credit risk, such as securities issued and guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury and Agencies. Approximately   95%   of our total investment securities portfolio was rated AA+ or its equivalent, or better, as of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , while

approximately   4%   and   5%   was below investment grade as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. We categorize the credit ratings of our investment securities based on the lowest credit rating as issued by the following rating agencies: Standard   Poor s Ratings Services ( S P ), Moody s Investors Service ( Moody s ) and Fitch Ratings ( Fitch ). 
  Table   12   provides information on the credit ratings of our non-agency RMBS, non-agency CMBS, other ABS and other securities in our portfolio as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

  Loans Held for Investment 
  Total loans held for investment ( HFI ) consists of both unsecuritized loans and loans held in our consolidated trusts. Table   13   summarizes the carrying value of our portfolio of loans held for investment by portfolio segment, net of the allowance for loan and lease losses, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  Table   13  :   Loans Held for Investment      

  Loans held for investment   increased   by   $8.2 billion   to   $238.0 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   from   December 31, 2015  ,   primarily driven by growth in our auto, commercial and credit card loan portfolios, partially offset by the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio and seasonal paydowns in our credit card loan portfolio  . 
  We provide additional information on the composition of our loan portfolio and credit quality below in  MD A   Credit Risk Profile  ,   MD A   Consolidated Results of Operations    and    Note 4 Loans  .  
   
  Loans Held for Sale 
  Loans held for sale, which are carried at lower of cost or fair value,   increased   by   $90 million   to   $994 million   as of   September 30, 2016   from   December 31, 2015  . The increase was primarily driven by higher originations in our multifamily finance business in our Commercial Banking business and the timing of sales of these loans, partially offset by the sale of certain commercial and domestic credit card loan portfolios. 
   
  Deposits 
  Our deposits represent our largest source of funding for our operations, providing a consistent source of low-cost funds. Total deposits   increased   by   $8.3 billion   to   $226.0 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   from   December 31, 2015  . The increase in deposits was primarily driven by growth in our Consumer Banking businesses   as a result of our continued focus on deposit relationships

with existing customers and our ability to attract new customers  . We provide information on the composition of our deposits, average outstanding balances, interest expense and yield below in  MD A   Liquidity Risk Profile  .  
   
  Securitized Debt Obligations 
  Securitized debt obligations increased to   $18.4 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  , from   $16.2 billion   as of   December 31, 2015  , as debt issuances exceeded maturities during   the first nine months of 2016  . We provide additional information on our borrowings below in  MD A   Liquidity Risk Profile  .  
   
  Other Debt 
  Other debt, which consists primarily of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, senior and subordinated notes, and Federal Home Loan Banks ( FHLB ) advances, totaled   $41.4 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  , of which   $40.3 billion   represented long-term debt and the remainder represented short-term borrowings.     Other debt totaled   $42.9 billion   as of   December 31, 2015  , of which   $42.0 billion   represented long-term debt and the remainder represented short-term borrowings.  
  The   decrease   in other debt of   $1.5 billion   in   the first nine months of 2016   was primarily attributable to a decrease in our FHLB advances outstanding. We provide additional information on our borrowings below in  MD A   Liquidity Risk Profile    and in    Note 8 Deposits and Borrowings  .  
   
  Mortgage Representation and Warranty Reserve 
  We acquired three subsidiaries that originated residential mortgage loans and sold these loans to various purchasers, including purchasers who created securitization trusts. These subsidiaries are Capital One Home Loans, LLC, which was acquired in February 2005; GreenPoint, which was acquired in December 2006 as part of the North Fork acquisition; and CCB, which was acquired in February 2009 and subsequently merged into CONA. 
  We have established representation and warranty reserves for losses associated with the mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable, including both litigation and non-litigation liabilities. These reserves are reported on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities. The reserve setting process relies heavily on estimates, which are inherently uncertain, and requires judgment. We evaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis. We build our representation and warranty reserves through the provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses, which we report in our consolidated statements of income as a component of non-interest income for loans originated and sold by CCB and Capital One Home Loans, LLC and as a component of discontinued operations for loans originated and sold by GreenPoint. The aggregate reserve for all three entities totaled   $632 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $610 million   as of   December 31, 2015  . 
   
  The table below summarizes changes in our representation and warranty reserve in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016   and   2015  . 
  Table   14  :   Changes in Representation and Warranty Reserve

    Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

Table of Contents  

As part of our business planning processes, we have considered various outcomes relating to the future representation and warranty liabilities of our subsidiaries that are possible but do not rise to the level of being both probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying an incremental reserve under applicable accounting standards. Our current best estimate of reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond what was in our reserve as of   September 30, 2016  , is approximately   $1.5 billion  , a decline from our estimate of   $1.6 billion   as of   December 31, 2015  .   The decrease in this estimate was primarily driven by favorable rulings in representation and warranty-related litigation. 
  We provide additional information related to the representation and warranty reserve, including factors that may impact the adequacy of the reserve and the ultimate amount of losses incurred by our subsidiaries, in    Note 14 Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others  .  
   
               OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES 

In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various types of arrangements with limited liability companies, partnerships or trusts that often involve special purpose entities and variable interest entities ( VIEs ). Some of these arrangements are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or may be recorded in amounts different from the full contract or notional amount of the arrangements, depending on the nature or structure of, and the accounting standards required to be applied to, the arrangement. These arrangements may expose us to potential losses in excess of the amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Our involvement in these arrangements can take many forms, including securitization and servicing activities, the purchase or sale of mortgage-backed or other asset-backed securities in connection with our home loan portfolio and loans to VIEs that hold debt, equity, real estate or other assets. 
  Our continuing involvement in unconsolidated VIEs primarily consists of certain home loan securitization trusts and affordable housing entities. We provide a discussion of our activities related to these VIEs in    Note 6 Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations  .  
   
               CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 

The level and composition of our capital are determined by multiple factors, including our consolidated regulatory capital requirements and internal risk-based capital assessments such as internal stress testing and economic capital. The level and composition of our capital may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment, conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments. 
  Capital Standards and Prompt Corrective Action 
  We are subject to capital adequacy standards adopted by the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) and FDIC (collectively, the  Federal Banking Agencies ), including the capital rules that implemented the Basel III capital framework ( Final Basel III Capital Rule ) developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ( Basel Committee ). Moreover, the Banks, as insured depository institutions, are subject to Prompt Corrective Action ( PCA ) capital regulations. 
  In July 2013, the Federal Banking Agencies adopted the Final Basel III Capital Rule, which, in addition to implementing the Basel III capital framework, also implemented certain Dodd-Frank Act and other capital provisions, and updated the PCA capital framework to reflect the new regulatory capital minimums. The Final Basel III Capital Rule amended both the Basel I and Basel II Advanced Approaches frameworks, established a new common equity Tier 1 capital requirement and set higher minimum capital ratio requirements. We refer to the amended Basel I framework as the  Basel III Standardized Approach,  and the amended Advanced Approaches framework as the  Basel III Advanced Approaches.   
  At the end of 2012, we met one of the two independent eligibility criteria set by banking regulators for becoming subject to the Advanced Approaches capital rules. As a result, we have undertaken a multi-year process of implementing the Advanced Approaches regime for calculating risk-weighted assets and regulatory capital levels. We entered parallel run under Advanced Approaches on January 1, 2015, during which we will calculate capital ratios under both the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches, though we will continue to use the Standardized Approach for purposes of meeting regulatory capital requirements.   The Basel Committee released proposed changes to the Basel III capital framework. There is uncertainty as to how the Federal Banking Agencies may adopt and implement those and any other potential changes in the United States capital rules  

32 
    Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

Table of Contents  

and how such changes may impact the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches once they become finalized.  
  The Market Risk Rule supplements both the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches by requiring institutions subject to the Market Risk Rule to adjust their risk-based capital ratios to reflect the market risk in their trading portfolios. The Market Risk Rule applies to institutions with aggregate trading assets and liabilities equal to the lesser of (i) 10% or more of total assets or (ii) $1 billion or more.   See  MD A   Market Risk Profile    below for additional information.   We began reporting risk-based capital ratios including market risk-weighted assets for the Company and CONA pursuant to the Market Risk Rule for positions covered by such rule in the third quarter of 2016. This change did not have a material impact on the risk-based capital ratios of these two entities. As of     September 30, 2016  ,   COBNA is not subject to the Market Risk Rule.    
   
  Table   15   provides a comparison of our regulatory capital ratios under the Basel III Standardized Approach subject to transition provisions, the regulatory minimum capital adequacy ratios and the PCA well-capitalized targets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

Table   15  :   Capital Ratios under Basel III   (1)(2)    
 __________  
            (1)   
    Capital ratios are calculated based on the Basel III Standardized Approach framework, subject to applicable transition provisions, such as the inclusion of the unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale included in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) and adjustments related to intangible assets other than goodwill. The inclusion of AOCI and the adjustments related to intangible assets are phased-in at 40% for 2015, 60% for 2016, 80% for 2017 and 100% for 2018. 
               (2)   
    Ratios as of   September 30, 2016   are preliminary. As we continue to validate our data, the calculations are subject to change until we file our   September 30, 2016   Form FR Y-9C Consolidated Financial Statements for Holding Companies and Call Reports. 
               (3)   
    Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on common equity Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets. 
               (4)   
    Tier 1 capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets. 
               (5)   
    Total capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on total capital divided by risk-weighted assets. 
               (6)   
    Tier 1 leverage ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average assets. 
               (7)   
    Supplementary leverage ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by total leverage exposure. 
     In addition to the above statutory capital ratios, we also disclose a non-GAAP TCE ratio in  MD A   Summary of Selected Financial Data  .  This capital measure is not necessarily comparable to similarly-titled capital measures reported by other companies. We provide information on the calculation of this ratio in  MD A Table   A     Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures and Calculation of Regulatory Capital Measures  .  
  The Company exceeded the minimum capital requirements and each of the Banks exceeded the minimum regulatory requirements and were  well-capitalized  under PCA requirements as of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  
  The Final Basel III Capital Rule requires banks to maintain a capital conservation buffer of   common equity Tier 1   capital of 2.5% above the regulatory minimum ratio and an incremental countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to be set at the discretion of the U.S. banking regulators (currently zero percent as of     September 30, 2016  ).   Both the capital conservation buffer and the countercyclical capital buffer (if applicable) will be phased-in over a transition period of four years commencing on January 1, 2016.     The applicable combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer is 0.625% in 2016 making the minimum capital requirement plus regulatory buffers for   common equity Tier 1 capital,   Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios, 5.125%, 6.625% and 8.625%, respectively, for the Company and the Banks during 2016.  
  A common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, or total capital ratio below the applicable regulatory minimum ratio and the combined capital conservation buffer and the countercyclical buffer (if applicable) might restrict a bank s ability to distribute

capital and make discretionary bonus payments. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   the Company and each of the Banks are all above the applicable combined thresholds.    
  Additionally, banks designated as Globally Systemically Important Banks ( GSIBs ) are subject to an additional regulatory capital surcharge above the combined capital conservation and countercyclical capital buffers established by the Final Basel III Capital Rule. We are currently not designated as a GSIB and therefore not subject to this surcharge.    
   
  The following table compares our common equity Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as of   September 30, 2016  , subject to applicable transition provisions, to our estimated fully phased-in common equity Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets, as it applies for Advanced Approaches banks like us that have not yet exited parallel run. Our estimated common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the fully phased-in Basel III Standardized Approach is based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and is subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. As we continue to engage with our regulators, there could be further changes to the calculation.

    Estimated common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the fully phased-in Basel III Standardized Approach is a non-GAAP financial measure. 
               (2)   
    Assumes adjustments are fully phased-in. 
                (4)   
    Adjustments include higher risk weights for items that are included in capital based on the threshold deduction approach, such as mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets. The adjustments also include removal of risk weights for items that are deducted from common equity Tier 1 capital. 
               (5)   
    Calculated by dividing estimated common equity Tier 1 capital by estimated risk-weighted assets, which are both calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach, as it applies when fully phased-in for Advanced Approaches banks that have not yet exited parallel run. 
     Under the Final Basel III Capital Rule, when we complete our parallel run for the Advanced Approaches, our minimum risk-based capital requirement will be determined by the greater of our risk-weighted assets under the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches. See  Part I Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation  in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional information.   Once we exit parallel run, based on clarification of the Final Basel III Capital Rule from our regulators, any amount by which our expected credit losses exceed eligible credit reserves, as each term is defined under the Final Basel III Capital Rule, will be deducted from our Basel III Standardized Approach numerator, subject to transition provisions. Inclusive of this impact, based on current capital rules and our business mix, we estimate that our Basel III Advanced Approaches ratios will be lower than our Basel III Standardized Approach ratios. However, there is uncertainty whether this will remain the case in light of potential changes to the United States capital rules.  
  Capital Planning and Regulatory Stress Testing 
  On April 5, 2016, we submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve as part of the 2016 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review ( CCAR ) cycle. On June 29, 2016, the Federal Reserve informed us that they had  no objection  to our CCAR 2016 Capital Plan submission. As a result of this non-objection to our capital plan, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of shares of our common stock from the third quarter of 2016 through the end of the second quarter of 2017, in addition to share repurchases related to employee compensation. The Board of Directors also authorized the quarterly dividend on our common stock of $0.40 per share. For the description of the regulatory capital planning rules we are subject to, see  Part I Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation  in our 2015 Form 10-K.

Equity Offerings and Transactions 
  On July 29, 2016, the Company issued and sold 24,000,000 Depositary Shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series G, $0.01 par value, with a liquidation preference of $25 per Depositary Share ( Series G Preferred Stock ). The net proceeds of the offering of Series G Preferred Stock were approximately $583 million, after deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses. Dividends on the Series G Preferred Stock are payable quarterly in arrears at a rate of 5.20% per annum. Under the terms of the Series G Preferred Stock, the ability of the Company to pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or to repurchase, redeem or acquire its common stock or any preferred stock ranking on parity with or junior to the Series G Preferred Stock, is subject to restrictions in the event that the Company does not declare and either pay or set aside a sum sufficient for payment of dividends on the Series G Preferred Stock for the immediately preceding dividend period. 
  Dividend Policy and Stock Purchases 
  We paid common stock dividends of   $0.40   per share in   the third quarter of 2016  . We paid preferred stock dividends of   $15.00   per share on the outstanding shares of our Series B Preferred Stock;   $15.625   per share on the outstanding shares of our Series C Preferred Stock;   $16.75   per share on the outstanding shares of our Series D Preferred Stock; and $  15.50   per share on the outstanding shares of our Series F Preferred Stock during   the third quarter of 2016  . As dividends on our Series E Preferred Stock are payable semi-annually, no dividends were paid on the Series E Preferred Stock in   the third quarter of 2016  . Our Series G Preferred Stock dividend payments are expected to occur beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
  The declaration and payment of dividends to our stockholders, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. As a bank holding company ( BHC ), our ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries. Regulatory restrictions exist that limit the ability of the Banks to transfer funds to our BHC. As of   September 30, 2016  , funds available for dividend payments from COBNA and CONA were   $3.5 billion   and   $806 million  , respectively. There can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends to stockholders. 
  Consistent with our 2016 Stock Repurchase Program, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of shares of common stock beginning in the third quarter of 2016 through the end of the second quarter of 2017. Through the end of the third quarter of 2016, we repurchased approximately   $1.2 billion   of shares of common stock as part of the 2016 Stock Repurchase Program. 
  The timing and exact amount of any future common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including market conditions, opportunities for growth, our capital position and amount of retained earnings. Our stock repurchase program does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time. For additional information on dividends and stock repurchases, see  Part I Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Transfer of Funds  in our 2015 Form 10-K.

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Overview  
  We use a risk framework to provide an overall enterprise-wide approach for effectively managing risk. We execute against our risk framework with the  Three Lines of Defense  risk management model to demonstrate and structure the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities in the organization for taking and managing risk.  
  The  First Line of Defense  is comprised of the business areas that through their day-to-day business activities take risk on our behalf. As the business owner, the first line is responsible for identifying, assessing, managing and controlling that risk. This principle places ultimate accountability for the management of risks and ownership of risk decisions with the CEO and business heads. The  Second Line of Defense  provides oversight of first line risk taking and management, and is primarily comprised of our Risk Management organization. The second line assists in determining risk appetite and the strategies, policies and structures for managing risks. The second line is both an  expert advisor  to the first line and an  effective challenger  of first line risk activities. The  Third Line of Defense  is comprised of our Internal Audit and Credit Review functions. The third line provides independent and objective assurance to senior management and to the Board of Directors that first and second line risk management and internal control systems and its governance processes are well-designed and working as intended. 
  The risk framework is also used to guide design of risk programs and performance of risk activity within each risk category and across the entire enterprise. When the elements of the framework are executed effectively, we operate according to our expectations for strong risk management.    
  There are eight elements that comprise the risk framework:  
             
    Establish Governance Processes, Accountabilities and Risk Appetites    
                
    Identify and Assess Risks and Ownership    
                
    Develop and Operate Controls, Monitoring and Mitigation Plans    
                
    Test and Detect Control Gaps and Perform Corrective Action    
                
    Escalate Key Risks and Gaps to Executive Management and, when appropriate, the Board of Directors    
                
    Calculate and Allocate Capital in Alignment with Risk Management and Measurement Processes (including Stress Testing)    
                
    Support with the Right Culture, Talent and Skills    
                
    Enabled by the Right Data, Infrastructure and Programs    
     We provide additional discussion of our risk management principles, roles and responsibilities, framework and risk appetite under  MD A Risk Management  in our   2015   Form 10-K. 
   
               CREDIT RISK PROFILE 

Our loan portfolio accounts for the substantial majority of our credit risk exposure. Our lending activities are governed under our credit policy and are subject to independent review and approval.   Below we provide information about the composition of our loan portfolio, key concentrations and credit performance metrics. 
  We also engage in certain non-lending activities that may give rise to credit and counterparty settlement risk, including the purchase of securities for our investment securities portfolio, entering into derivative transactions to manage our market risk exposure and to accommodate customers, short-term advances on syndication activity (including bridge financing transactions we have underwritten), certain operational cash balances in other financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and customer overdrafts.   We provide additional information on credit risk related to our investment securities portfolio under  MD A Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis Investment Securities  and credit risk related to derivative transactions in    Note 9 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  .

Commercial Loans 
  For purposes of portfolio risk management, we aggregate our commercial loan portfolio according to market segmentation primarily based on standard industry codes. Table   18   summarizes our commercial loans held for investment portfolio by industry classification as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

    In addition to loans outstanding, we also have unfunded lending commitments of approximately   $2.8 billion   and   $3.4 billion   to oil and gas companies as of   September 30, 2016   and     December 31, 2015  , respectively. For information on our total unfunded lending commitments to extend credit see    Note 4 Loans  .

    Includes our taxi medallion lending portfolio among other portfolios. 
      
  Purchased Credit-Impaired Loans 
  Our portfolio of loans includes certain of our consumer and commercial loans acquired in business acquisitions that were recorded at fair value at acquisition and subsequently accounted for using the guidance for accounting for PCI loans and debt securities, which is based upon expected cash flows. These PCI loans totaled   $16.1 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   $19.5 billion   as of   December 31, 2015  . See  MD A Glossary and Acronyms  for the definition of  PCI loans.  
  The difference between the fair value at acquisition and expected cash flows represents the accretable yield, which is recognized in interest income over the life of the loans. The difference between the contractual payments on the loans and expected cash flows represents the nonaccretable difference or the amount of principal and interest not considered collectible, which incorporates future expected credit losses over the life of the loans. We regularly update our estimate of expected principal and interest to be collected from these loans and evaluate the results for each accounting pool that was established at acquisition based on loans with common risk characteristics. Probable decreases in expected cash flows would trigger the recognition of an allowance for loan and lease losses through our provision for credit losses. Probable and significant increases in expected cash flows would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan and lease losses established subsequent to acquisition, with any remaining increase in expected cash flows recognized prospectively in interest income over the remaining estimated life of the underlying loans. See    Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    in our   2015   Form 10-K for additional information on PCI loans.

Home Loans 
  The majority of our home loan portfolio are PCI loans acquired from the ING Direct and CCB acquisitions, representing   69%   and   73%   of our total home loan portfolio as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. See  MD A Glossary and Acronyms  for the definition of ING Direct and CCB acquisitions. The expected cash flows for the PCI loans in our home loan portfolio are significantly impacted by future expectations of home prices and interest rates. Decreases in expected cash flows that result from declining conditions, particularly associated with these variables, could result in an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses and reduction in accretable yield. Charge-offs on these loans are not recorded until the expected credit losses within the nonaccretable difference are depleted. In addition, PCI loans are not classified as delinquent or nonperforming as we  expect to collect our net investment in these loans and the nonaccretable difference is expected to absorb the majority of the losses associated with these loans. 
  Table   19   presents our total home loan portfolio and the break out of the PCI loans and remaining loans within our home loan portfolio by lien priority.

Credit Risk Measurement 
  We closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to assess and manage our exposure to credit risk. Key metrics we track in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming asset rates, as well as net charge-off rates and our internal risk ratings of larger balance commercial loans. Trends in delinquency rates are a primary indicator of credit risk within our consumer loan portfolios, as changes in delinquency rates provide an early warning of changes in credit quality. The primary indicator of credit risk in our commercial loan portfolios is our internal risk ratings. Because we generally classify loans that have been delinquent for an extended period of time and other loans with significant risk of loss as nonperforming, the level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of our loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on regional economic conditions.    
  We underwrite most consumer loans using proprietary models, which are typically based on credit bureau data, including borrower credit scores, along with application information and, where applicable, collateral and deal structure data. We continuously adjust our management of credit lines and collection strategies based on customer behavior and risk profile changes. We also use borrower credit scores for subprime classification, for competitive benchmarking and, in some cases, to drive product segmentation decisions.  
  The following table provides details on the credit scores of our domestic card loans held for investment and auto loan portfolios as of   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  . 
  Table   21  :   Credit Score Distribution   
 __________    
            (1)   
    Credit scores generally represent FICO scores. These scores are obtained from one of the major credit bureaus at origination and are refreshed monthly thereafter. We approximate non-FICO credit scores to comparable FICO scores for consistency purposes. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 660 or below category. 
               (2)   
    Credit scores generally represent average FICO scores obtained from three credit bureaus at the time of application and are not refreshed thereafter. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 620 or below category.    
     We present information in the section below on the credit performance of our loan portfolio, including the key metrics we use in tracking changes in the credit quality of our loan portfolio. 
  See    Note 4 Loans    in this Report for additional credit quality information. Also, see    Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    in our   2015   Form 10-K for information on our accounting policies for delinquent and nonperforming loans, net charge-offs and TDRs for each of our loan categories. 
   
  Delinquency Rates 
  We consider the entire balance of an account to be delinquent if the minimum required payment is not received by the customer s due date, measured at the reporting date. Our 30+ day delinquency metrics include all loans held for investment that are 30 or more days past due, whereas our 30+ day performing delinquency metrics include loans that are 30 or more days past due but are currently classified as performing and accruing interest. The 30+ day delinquency and 30+ day performing delinquency metrics are the same for domestic credit card loans, as we continue to classify the substantial majority of domestic credit card loans as performing until the account is charged off, typically when the account is 180 days past due. See    Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    in our   2015   Form 10-K for information on our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming for each of

  Table   24   summarizes loans that were 90+ days delinquent as to interest or principal, and still accruing interest as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . These loans consist primarily of credit card accounts between 90 days and 179 days past due. As permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council ( FFIEC ), we continue to accrue interest and fees on domestic credit card loans through the date of charge-off, which is typically in the period the account becomes 180 days past due. While domestic credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until the loan is charged off, we reduce the balance of our credit card receivables by the amount of finance charges and fees billed but not expected to be collected and exclude this amount from revenue.

  Nonperforming Loans and Nonperforming Assets 
  Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans, foreclosed properties and repossessed assets and the net realizable value of auto loans that have been charged off as a result of a bankruptcy. Nonperforming loans include loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status. See    Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    in our   2015   Form 10-K for information on our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming for each of our loan categories.

Table   25   presents comparative information on nonperforming loans, by portfolio segment, and other nonperforming assets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .   The nonperforming loan rates are calculated based on nonperforming loans for each category divided by period-end total loans held for investment for each respective category.   We do not classify loans held for sale as nonperforming, as they are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. We provide additional information on our credit quality metrics above under  MD A Business Segment Financial Performance.

    We recognized interest income for loans classified as nonperforming of   $28 million   and   $27 million   in   the first nine months of 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Interest income foregone related to nonperforming loans was   $49 million   and   $42 million   in   the first nine months of 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Foregone interest income represents the amount of interest income that would have been recorded during the period for nonperforming loans as of the end of the period had the loans performed according to their contractual terms.

Net Charge-Offs 
  Net charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine to be uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We charge off loans as a reduction to the allowance for loan and lease losses when we determine the loan is uncollectible and record subsequent recoveries of previously charged off amounts as increases to the allowance for loan and lease losses. We exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and certain fraud losses from charge-offs. Generally, costs to recover charged-off loans are recorded as collection expenses and included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest expense as incurred. Our charge-off policy for loans varies based on the loan type. See    Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    in our   2015   Form 10-K for information on our charge-off policy for each of our loan categories. 
  Table   26   presents our net charge-off amounts and rates, by portfolio segment, in   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016   and   2015  .

Troubled Debt Restructurings 
  As part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may provide short-term (three to twelve months) or long-term (greater than twelve months) modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to improve long-term collectability of the loan and to avoid the need for foreclosure or repossession of collateral. 
  Table   27   presents our recorded investment of loans modified in TDRs as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . It excludes loan modifications that do not meet the definition of a TDR and PCI loans, which we track and report separately. 
  Table   27  :   Troubled Debt Restructurings   
   
  In the Credit Card business, the majority of our credit card loans modified in TDRs involve reducing the interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. The interest rate in effect immediately prior to the loan modification is used as the effective interest rate for purposes of measuring impairment using the present value of expected cash flows. In some cases, the interest rate on a credit card account automatically increases due to non-payment, late payment or similar events. In all cases, we cancel the customer s available line of credit on the credit card. If the customer does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan agreement may revert to its original payment terms, likely resulting in any loan outstanding reflected in the appropriate delinquency category, and charged off in accordance with our standard charge-off policy. 
  In the Consumer Banking business, the majority of our loans modified in TDRs receive an extension, an interest rate reduction or principal reduction, or a combination of both. In addition, TDRs also occur in connection with bankruptcy of the borrower. In certain bankruptcy discharges, the loan is written down to the collateral value and the charged off amount is reported as principal reduction. Their impairment is determined using the present value of expected cash flows or a collateral evaluation for certain auto and home loans where the collateral value is lower than the recorded investment.  
  In the Commercial Banking business, the majority of loans modified in TDRs receive an extension, with a portion of these loans receiving an interest rate reduction. The impairment on modified commercial loans is generally determined based on the underlying collateral value. We provide additional information on modified loans accounted for as TDRs, including the performance of those loans subsequent to modification, in    Note 4 Loans  .  
   
  Impaired Loans 
  A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan. Generally, we report loans as impaired based on the method for measuring impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. Loans defined as individually impaired include larger balance commercial nonperforming loans and TDRs. Loans held for sale are not reported as impaired, as these loans are recorded at lower of cost or fair value. Impaired loans also exclude PCI loans accounted for based on expected cash flows because this accounting methodology takes into consideration future credit losses expected to be incurred.

Impaired loans, including TDRs, totaled   $3.0 billion   and   $2.5 billion   as of    September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Modified TDR loans accounted for   $2.3 billion   and   $1.8 billion   of impaired loans as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. We provide additional information on our impaired loans, including the allowance for loan and lease losses established for these loans, in    Note 4 Loans    and    Note 5 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments  .  
   
  Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments 
  Our allowance for loan and lease losses represents management s best estimate of incurred loan and lease credit losses inherent in our held for investment portfolio as of each balance sheet date. The allowance for loan and lease losses is increased through the provision for credit losses and reduced by net charge-offs. We provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for loan and lease losses under    Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    in our 2015 Form 10-K. 
  Our allowance for loan and lease losses   increased   by   $1.1 billion   to   $6.3 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   from   December 31, 2015  , and the allowance coverage ratio   increased   by   40   basis points to   2.63%   as of   September 30, 2016   from   December 31, 2015  .   The increases were primarily driven by (i) a higher domestic card allowance due to continued portfolio growth, the effects of growth and subprime mix, and slightly higher expected credit losses in 2017 for portions of our credit card portfolio collectively leading to an increased overall loss rate; (ii) continued adverse industry conditions impacting our taxi medallion and oil and gas lending portfolios in our Commercial Banking business; and (iii) continued auto loan growth and the effects of growth leading to an increased overall loss rate  . 
  Table   28   presents changes in our allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments for   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016   and   2015  , and details by portfolio segment the provision for credit losses, charge-offs and recoveries recognized in our consolidated statements of income.

               LIQUIDITY RISK PROFILE 

We have established liquidity practices that are intended to ensure that we have sufficient asset-based liquidity to withstand the potential impact of deposit attrition or diminished liquidity in the funding markets. Our practices are intended to maintain adequate liquidity reserves to cover our funding requirements as well as any potential deposit run-off and maintain access to diversified funding sources to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. Our liquidity reserves consist of readily-marketable or pledgable assets which can be used as a source of liquidity, if needed. 
   
  Table   30   below presents the composition of our liquidity reserves as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

 __________ 
             (2)   
    As part of our liquidity management strategy, we pledge securities to secure borrowings from counterparties and to secure trust and public deposits and other purposes as required or permitted by law. We pledged securities available for sale with a fair value of   $2.1 billion   and   $1.7 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. We also pledged securities held to maturity with a carrying value of   $7.4 billion   and   $8.7 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
     Our liquidity reserves   increased   by   $4.8 billion   to   $76.7 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   from   December 31, 2015   primarily due to an increase in our investment securities portfolio. See  MD A   Risk Management    in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional information on our management of liquidity risk.

We are subject to the Final Liquidity Coverage Rules ( Final LCR Rule ) issued by the Federal Banking Agencies. The Final LCR Rule came into effect in January 2015 and required us to calculate the LCR as of the last business day of each month from January 2015 until July 2016, and requires us to calculate the LCR on a daily basis thereafter. The minimum LCR standard is phased in as follows: 90% by January 1, 2016; and 100% by January 1, 2017 and thereafter. At   September 30, 2016  , we exceeded the fully phased-in LCR requirement. The calculation and the underlying components are based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and are subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations.  
   
  Borrowing Capacity 
  We filed a shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on March 31, 2015, which expires in March 2018. Under this shelf registration, we may periodically offer and sell an indeterminate aggregate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants and units. There is no limit under this shelf registration to the amount or number of such securities that we may offer and sell, subject to market conditions. We also filed a new shelf registration statement with the SEC on January 12, 2016, which expires in January 2019 and allows us to periodically offer and sell up to $23 billion of securitized debt obligations from our credit card loan securitization trust. 
  In addition to our issuance capacity under the shelf registration statements, we also have access to FHLB advances with a maximum borrowing capacity of   $26.2 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  , of which   $9.4 billion   was still available to us to borrow as of   September 30, 2016  . We pledged loan collateral with an outstanding balance of   $30.0 billion   to secure this borrowing capacity. The ability to draw down funding is based on membership status and the amount is dependent upon the Banks  ability to post collateral. Our FHLB membership is secured by our investment in FHLB stock of   $723 million   and   $884 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which was determined in part based on our outstanding advances. We also have access to the Federal Reserve Discount Window through which we had a borrowing capacity of   $8.7 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  . Although available, we do not view this borrowing capacity as a primary source of liquidity and did not utilize it during 2015 or   the first nine months of 2016  . 
   
  Funding 
  The Company s primary source of funding comes from deposits, which provide us with a stable and relatively low cost of funds. In addition to deposits, the Company raises funding through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, FHLB advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios, the issuance of securitized debt obligations, the issuance of brokered deposits, the federal funds purchased and other borrowings. A key objective in our use of these markets is to maintain access to a diversified mix of wholesale funding sources. 
   
  Deposits 
  Table   31   provides the composition of deposits as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , as well as a comparison of average balances, interest expense and average deposit rates for   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

      Our deposits include brokered deposits, which we obtained through the use of third-party intermediaries. Those brokered deposits are reported as interest-bearing checking, saving deposits and time deposits in the above table and totaled   $15.0 billion   and   $12.0 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  The FDIC limits the acceptance of brokered deposits by  well-capitalized  insured depository institutions and, with a waiver from the FDIC, by  adequately capitalized  institutions. COBNA and CONA were  well-capitalized,  as defined under the federal banking regulatory guidelines, as of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . See  Part I Item 1.

  Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt 
  We access the capital markets to meet our funding needs through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligations, and federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. In addition, we may utilize short-term and long-term FHLB advances secured by our investment securities, residential home loans, multifamily real estate loans, commercial real estate loans and home equity lines of credit. Substantially all of our long-term FHLB advances are structured with either a   one-month or a three-month   call option at our discretion. 
  Our short-term borrowings include those borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less and do not include the current portion of long-term debt. The short-term borrowings, which consist of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, and short-term FHLB advances,   increased   by   $98 million   to   $1.1 billion   as of    September 30, 2016   from   December 31, 2015  .

  Credit Ratings 
  Our credit ratings impact our ability to access capital markets and our borrowing costs. Rating agencies base their ratings on numerous factors, including liquidity, capital adequacy, asset quality, quality of earnings and the probability of systemic support. Significant changes in these factors could result in different ratings. Such ratings help to support our cost effective unsecured funding as part of our overall financing programs.  
  Table   33   provides a summary of the credit ratings for the senior unsecured long-term debt of Capital One Financial Corporation, COBNA and CONA as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

               MARKET RISK PROFILE 

Market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities, including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and derivatives. Below we provide additional information about our primary sources of market risk, our market risk management strategies and the measures we use to evaluate our market risk exposure. 
  Primary Market Risk Exposures 
  Our primary source of market risk is interest rate risk. We also have exposure to foreign exchange risk and customer-related trading risk. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  Interest rate risk, which represents exposure to instruments whose yield or price varies with the volatility of interest rates, is our most significant source of market risk exposure. Banks are inevitably exposed to interest rate risk due to differences in the timing between the maturities or re-pricing of assets and liabilities. 
  Foreign Exchange Risk 
  Foreign exchange risk represents exposure to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies. Our primary exposure to foreign exchange risk is related to the operations of our International Card business in the U.K. and Canada. The largest foreign exchange exposure arising from these operations is the funding they are provided in the Great British pound ( GBP ) and the Canadian dollar ( CAD ), respectively. We have net equity investments in these operations and provide intercompany funding to them denominated in GBP and CAD, as well as exposure to the dollar-denominated value of future earnings and cash flows they generate.  
  Our intercompany funding exposes our consolidated statements of income to foreign exchange transaction risk, while our equity investments in our foreign operations result in translation risk in AOCI and our capital ratios. We manage our transaction risk by entering into forward foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to foreign currency-denominated intercompany borrowings. We use foreign currency derivative contracts as net investment hedges to manage our AOCI exposure. As of September 30, 2016, we apply hedge accounting to both our intercompany funding hedges and our net investment hedges, with the primary net investments subject to hedging those denominated in GBP.  
  In regard to our non-dollar-denominated equity, we measure our total exposure by regularly tracking the value of our net equity invested in the largest of our U.K. and Canadian operations. We apply a 30% U.S. dollar appreciation shock against these net investment exposures, which we believe approximates a significant adverse foreign exchange movement over a one-year time horizon. Our gross equity exposures in our International Card business were   1.5 billion   GBP  and   1.4 billion   GBP as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and   819 million   CAD and   686 million   CAD as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
  The intercompany borrowings to our International Card business were   802 million   GBP and   893 million   GBP as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and   5.9 billion   CAD as of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. We hedge all the cash flows associated with these borrowings with forward foreign currency derivative contracts. 
  As a result of our derivative management activities, we believe our net exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimal. 
  Customer-Related Trading Risk 
  We offer various interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity derivatives as an accommodation to our customers within our Commercial Banking business and offset the majority of these exposures through derivative transactions with other counterparties. These exposures are measured and monitored on a daily basis. 
  We employ value-at-risk ( VaR ) as the primary method to both measure and monitor the market risk in our customer-related trading activities. VaR is a statistical-based risk measure used to estimate the potential loss from adverse market movements in a normal market environment. We employ a historical simulation approach using the most recent 500 business days and use a 99 percent confidence level and a holding period of 1 business day. We use internal models to produce a daily VaR measure of the market risk of all customer-related trading exposures.

For further information on our customer-related trading exposures, see    Note 9 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  .  
  Market Risk Management 
  We employ several techniques to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk, which include, but are not limited to, altering the duration and re-pricing characteristics of our various assets and liabilities through interest rate derivatives and mitigating the foreign exchange exposure of certain non-dollar-denominated equity or transactions through derivatives. Derivatives are one of the primary tools we use in managing interest rate and foreign exchange risk. Our current market risk management policies include the use of derivatives. We execute our derivative contracts in both over-the-counter ( OTC ) and exchange-traded derivative markets and have exposure to both bilateral and clearinghouse counterparties. Although the majority of our derivatives are interest rate swaps, we also use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage both our interest rate and foreign currency risk. The outstanding notional amount of our derivative contracts increased to   $133.4 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   from   $105.9 billion   as of   December 31, 2015   primarily driven by an increase in our hedging activities. 
  Market Risk Measurement 
  We have risk management policies and limits established by our market risk management policies and approved by the Board of Directors. Our objective is to manage our asset and liability risk position and exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and prescribed limits based on prevailing market conditions and long-term expectations. Because no single measure can reflect all aspects of market risk, we use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analysis to measure, assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and our economic value of equity and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our non-dollar-denominated earnings and non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations. We provide additional information below in  Economic Value of Equity.  
  We consider the impact on both net interest income and economic value of equity in measuring and managing our interest rate risk. Because the federal funds rate was lowered to near zero in December 2008, the rate remained in a target range of 0% to 0.25% until December 2015, and subsequently increased to a range of 0.25% to 0.50%, we use a 50 basis points decrease as our declining interest rate scenario, since a scenario where interest rates would decline by 200 basis points is unlikely. In scenarios where a 50 basis points decline would result in a rate less than 0%, we assume a rate of 0%. Below we discuss the assumptions used in calculating each of these measures.  
  Net Interest Income Sensitivity 
  This sensitivity measure estimates the impact on our projected 12-month base-line interest rate-sensitive revenue resulting from movements in interest rates. Interest rate-sensitive revenue consists of net interest income and certain components of other non-interest income significantly impacted by movements in interest rates, including changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and free-standing interest rate swaps. Adjusted net interest income consists of net interest income and changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, including related derivative hedging activity, and changes in the fair value of free-standing interest rate swaps. In addition to our existing assets and liabilities, we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions, such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, and plans for projected changes in our funding mix in our baseline forecast. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our projected interest rate-sensitive revenue,   we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates of +200 basis points, +100 basis points, +50 basis points and -50 basis points to spot rates, with the lower rate scenario limited to zero as described above  . At the current level of interest rates, we are asset sensitive. The lower asset sensitivity in the +200 basis points scenario compared with the +100 basis points scenario is mainly driven by the assumption that deposit repricing increases with higher interest rates. 
  Economic Value of Equity 
  Our economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact on the net present value of our assets and liabilities, including derivative hedging activity, resulting from movements in interest rates. Our economic value of equity sensitivity measures are calculated based on our existing assets and liabilities, including derivatives, and do not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected plans for funding mix changes. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our economic value of equity,   we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates of +200 basis points, +100 basis points, +50 basis points and -50 basis points to spot rates, with the lower rate scenario limited to zero as described above  .

During the second quarter of 2016, we updated our projected deposit re-pricing assumptions as part of our regular evaluation and assessment of the assumptions and models used to measure our interest rate risk sensitivity. This update reduced our estimated asset sensitivity as shown in our projected base-line net interest income measure and had a minor impact to our economic value of equity measures. 
  Table   34   shows the estimated percentage impact on our projected base-line net interest income and economic value of equity calculated under our revised methodology described above as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , as well as under our previous methodology as of   December 31, 2015  . 
  Table   34  :   Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis   

  Our projected net interest income and economic value of equity sensitivity measures were within our policy limits as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . In addition to these industry standard measures, we will continue to factor into our internal interest rate risk management decisions the potential impact of alternative interest rate scenarios, such as stressed rate shocks as well as steepening and flattening yield curve scenarios. 
  Limitations of Market Risk Measures 
  The interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information, internally-developed assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies, which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments. Other market inputs, such as interest rates, market prices and interest rate volatility, are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures. We regularly evaluate, update and enhance these assumptions, models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities. 
  There are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. The sensitivity analysis described above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is performed at a particular point in time based on the existing balance sheet and, in some cases, expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions. The strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ significantly from our projections, which could cause our actual earnings and economic value of equity sensitivities to differ substantially from the above sensitivity analysis. 
   
               SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

On August 30, 2016, the FDIC provided notice that the Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) Reserve Ratio rose to 1.17% on June 30, 2016. As a result, two major changes were triggered to deposit insurance assessments effective in the third quarter and will be reflected in banks  December 2016 FDIC assessment invoices. First, the range of initial assessment rates for all banks, including the Banks, will decline based on final FDIC rules issued on February 7, 2011, and April 26, 2016. Second, the surcharge assessments imposed on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more, including the Banks, will equal an annual rate of 4.5 basis points, in addition to the regular quarterly deposit insurance assessments applicable to all insured depository institutions, pursuant to the final FDIC rule issued on March 15, 2016.

Leverage ratio:   Tier 1 capital divided by average assets after certain adjustments, as defined by the regulators.  
  Liquidity risk:   The risk that the Company will not be able to meet its future financial obligations as they come due, or invest in future asset growth because of an inability to obtain funds at a reasonable price within a reasonable time period. 
  Loan-to-value ( LTV ) ratio:   The relationship expressed as a percentage, between the principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of the collateral (i.e., residential real estate, autos, etc.) securing the loan. 
  Managed presentation:   A non-GAAP presentation of financial results that includes reclassifications to present revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure at the segment level, because it believes this provides information to enable investors to understand the underlying operational performance and trends of the particular business segment and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with the performance of competitors. 
  Market risk:   The risk that an institution s earnings or the economic value of equity could be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates or other market factors. 
  Master netting agreement:   An agreement between two counterparties that have multiple contracts with each other that provides for the net settlement of all contracts through a single payment in the event of default or termination of any one contract. 
  Mortgage-backed security ( MBS ):   An asset-backed security whose cash flows are backed by the principal and interest payments of a set of mortgage loans. 
  Mortgage servicing rights ( MSR ):   The right to service a mortgage loan when the underlying loan is sold or securitized. Servicing includes collections for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors. 
  Net interest margin:   The result of dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. 
  Nonperforming loans and leases:   Loans and leases that have been placed on non-accrual status. 
  North Fork:   North Fork Bancorporation, Inc., which was acquired by the Company in 2006. 
  Operational risk:   The risk of loss, capital impairment, adverse customer experience or reputational impact resulting from failure to comply with policies and procedures, failed internal processes or systems, or from external events. 
  Option-ARM loans:   The option-ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-rate mortgage loan that initially provides the borrower with the monthly option to make a fully-amortizing, interest-only or minimum fixed payment. After the initial payment option period, usually five years, the recalculated minimum payment represents a fully-amortizing principal and interest payment that would effectively repay the loan by the end of its contractual term. 
  Other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ):   An impairment charge taken on a security whose fair value has fallen below the carrying value on the balance sheet and whose value is not expected to recover through the holding period of the security. 
  PCI loans:   Refers to the loans acquired in a business combination that were recorded at fair value at acquisition and subsequently accounted for based on cash flows expected to be collected in accordance with ASC 310-30,   Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality   (formerly known as  Statement of Position 03-3,   Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer,    commonly referred to as  SOP 03-3 ). Acquired loans are considered PCI loans if they have a discount attributable, at least in part, to credit deterioration and they are not specifically scoped out of this guidance. Our PCI loans include a limited portion of commercial loans acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015 in the HFS acquisition and the substantial majority of consumer and commercial loans acquired in the ING Direct and Chevy Chase acquisitions. 
  The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the estimated fair value of purchased loans represents the accretable yield, which is recognized into interest income over the life of the loans. The difference between total contractual payments on the loans and all expected cash flows represents the nonaccretable difference or the amount of principal and interest not considered collectible, which incorporates future expected credit losses over the life of the loans. Decreases in expected cash flows from credit deterioration subsequent to acquisition will generally result in an impairment charge recognized in our provision for credit losses and an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses. Charge-offs are not recorded until the expected credit losses within the nonaccretable difference are depleted. PCI loans are not classified as delinquent or nonperforming as we expect to collect our net investment in these loans and the nonaccretable difference will absorb the majority of the losses associated with these loans. In addition, PCI loans are excluded from impaired loans because the applicable accounting methodology takes into consideration expected future credit losses. 
  Public Fund deposits:   Deposits that are derived from a variety of political subdivisions such as school districts and municipalities.

NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The Company 
  Capital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware Corporation established in 1994 and headquartered in McLean, Virginia, is a diversified financial services holding company with banking and non-banking subsidiaries. Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the  Company ) offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through branches, the internet and other distribution channels. As of   September 30, 2016  , our principal subsidiaries included: 
             
    Capital One Bank (USA), National Association ( COBNA ), which offers credit and debit card products, other lending products and deposit products; and 
                
    Capital One, National Association ( CONA ), which offers a broad spectrum of banking products and financial services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients. 
     The Company and its subsidiaries are hereafter collectively referred to as  we,   us  or  our.  COBNA and CONA are collectively referred to as the  Banks.  
  We also offer products outside of the United States of America ( U.S. ) principally through Capital One (Europe) plc ( COEP ), an indirect subsidiary of COBNA organized and located in the United Kingdom ( U.K. ) and through a branch of COBNA in Canada. COEP has authority, among other things, to provide credit card loans. Our branch of COBNA in Canada also has the authority to provide credit card loans. 
  Our principal operations are currently organized for management reporting purposes into   three   major business segments, which are defined based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. We provide details on our business segments, the integration of recent acquisitions into our business segments and the allocation methodologies and accounting policies used to derive our business segment results in    Note 13 Business Segments  .  
  On December 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the Healthcare Financial Services business of General Electric Capital Corporation ( HFS acquisition ). During the second quarter of 2016, we finalized purchase accounting. Including post-closing purchase price adjustments during the first six months of 2016, total cash consideration for the acquisition was   $9.0 billion  , including   $180 million   of cash acquired, and we recognized approximately   $9.2 billion   in assets, primarily consisting of   $8.2 billion   in loans,   $134 million   in intangible assets and   $518 million   in goodwill. 
  Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ( U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and in the related disclosures. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. While management makes its best judgment, actual amounts or results could differ from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included for a fair statement of this interim financial information. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 
  Principles of Consolidation  
  The unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Capital One Financial Corporation and all other entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. We determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity ( VIE ). All significant intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
  Newly Adopted Accounting Standards 
  Consolidation: Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis 
  In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued revised guidance for evaluating whether organizations should consolidate certain legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations and securitization structures. The guidance also removed the indefinite deferral of specialized guidance for certain investment funds. We adopted the guidance effective in the first quarter of 2016 on a modified retrospective basis. Our adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. See    Note 6 Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations    for information regarding our involvement with VIEs. 
  Recently Issued but Not Yet Adopted Accounting Standards  
  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued revised guidance for impairments on financial instruments. The guidance requires an impairment model (known as the current expected credit loss ( CECL ) model) that is based on expected rather than incurred losses, with an anticipated result of more timely loss recognition. The CECL model is applicable to loans held for investment, securities held to maturity, lease receivables, financial guarantee contracts and certain unconditional loan commitments. The CECL model will replace our current accounting for purchased credit-impaired ( PCI ) and impaired loans. The guidance also amends the available for sale ( AFS ) debt securities other-than-temporary impairments ( OTTI ) model. Credit losses (and subsequent recoveries) on AFS debt securities will be recorded through an allowance approach, rather than the current U.S. GAAP practice of permanent write-downs for credit losses and accreting positive changes through interest income over time. This guidance will be effective for us on January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted no earlier than January 1, 2019. We are currently assessing the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Accounting 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued revised guidance for accounting for employee share-based payments, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective beginning on January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We do not believe the impact of this guidance will be material to our consolidated financial statements.  
  Leases 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued revised guidance for leases. The guidance requires lessees to recognize right of use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements for all leases, with certain practical expedients. This will be effective for us on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued revised guidance for the recognition, measurement and disclosure of revenue from contracts with customers. The guidance is applicable to all entities and, once effective, will replace significant portions of existing industry and transaction-specific revenue recognition rules with a more principles-based recognition model. Most revenue associated with financial instruments, including interest and loan origination fees, is outside the scope of the guidance. Gains and losses on investment securities, derivatives and sales of financial instruments are similarly excluded from the scope. Subsequent to issuance of the revenue recognition guidance, the FASB has issued several updates, most notably that (i) deferred by one year the effective date for revenue recognition guidance to January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted effective January 1, 2017; (ii) clarified its guidance for performing the principle-versus-agent analysis; and (iii) clarified guidance for identifying performance obligations allowing entities to ignore immaterial promised goods and services in the context of a contract with a customer. Entities can elect to adopt the guidance either on a full or modified retrospective basis. Full retrospective adoption will require a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. Modified retrospective adoption will require a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the entity first applies the new guidance. We do not plan to early adopt the guidance. We are currently assessing the potential impact of this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and which transition method we plan to elect.

NOTE 2 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 

Our discontinued operations consist of the mortgage origination operations of our wholesale mortgage banking unit, GreenPoint Mortgage Funding Inc. ( GreenPoint ) and the manufactured housing operations of GreenPoint Credit, LLC, a subsidiary of GreenPoint, both of which were acquired as part of the North Fork Bancorporation, Inc. ( North Fork ) acquisition in December 2006. Although the manufactured housing operations were sold to a third party in 2004 prior to our acquisition of North Fork, we acquired certain retained interests and obligations related to those operations as part of the acquisition. Separately, in the third quarter of 2007 we closed the mortgage origination operations of the wholesale mortgage banking unit. The results of both the wholesale banking unit and the manufactured housing operations have been accounted for as discontinued operations and are reported as income or loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, on the consolidated statements of income. We have no significant continuing involvement in these operations. 
  The following table summarizes the results from discontinued operations for   the third quarter and first nine months of 2016   and   2015  :  
  Table 2.1: Results of Discontinued Operations      

  The discontinued mortgage origination operations of our wholesale mortgage banking unit had remaining assets which primarily consisted of a deferred tax asset related to the reserve for representations and warranties on loans previously sold to third parties. We also have contingent obligations to exercise certain mandatory clean-up calls associated with securitization transactions undertaken by the discontinued GreenPoint Credit, LLC manufactured housing operations in the event the third party servicer does not fulfill its obligation to exercise these clean-up calls.

Investment Securities in a Gross Unrealized Loss Position 
  The table below provides, by major security type, information about our securities available for sale in a gross unrealized loss position and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  
  Table 3.4: Securities in a Gross Unrealized Loss Position   

76 
    Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

Table of Contents  

As of   September 30, 2016  , the amortized cost of approximately   490   securities available for sale exceeded their fair value by   $101 million  , of which   $71 million   related to securities that had been in a loss position for 12 months or longer. As of   September 30, 2016  , our investments in non-agency RMBS and CMBS, other ABS and other securities accounted for   $10 million  , or   10%  , of total gross unrealized losses on securities available for sale. As of   September 30, 2016  , the carrying value of approximately   20   securities classified as held to maturity exceeded their fair value by   $6 million  .  
  Gross unrealized losses on our investment securities have decreased since December 31, 2015. The unrealized losses related to investment securities for which we have not recognized credit impairment were primarily attributable to changes in market interest rates. As discussed in more detail below, we conduct periodic reviews of all investment securities with unrealized losses to assess whether impairment is other-than-temporary.  
  Maturities and Yields of Investment Securities 
  The following tables summarize the remaining scheduled contractual maturities, assuming no prepayments, of our investment securities as of   September 30, 2016  .

The table below summarizes, by major security type, the expected maturities and weighted-average yields of our investment securities as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  Table 3.7: Expected Maturities and Weighted-Average Yields of Securities   
 __________ 
            (1)   
    The weighted-average yield represents the effective yield for the investment securities and is calculated based on the amortized cost of each security. 
     Other-Than-Temporary Impairment 
  We evaluate all securities in an unrealized loss position at least on a quarterly basis, and more often as market conditions require, to assess whether the impairment is other-than-temporary. Our OTTI assessment is based on a discounted cash flow analysis which requires careful use of judgments and assumptions. A number of qualitative and quantitative criteria may be considered in our assessment as applicable, including the size and the nature of the portfolio; historical and projected performance such as prepayment, default and loss severity for the RMBS portfolio; recent credit events specific to the issuer and/or industry to which the issuer belongs; the payment structure of the security; external credit ratings of the issuer and any failure or delay of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments; the value of underlying collateral; our intent and ability to hold the security; and current and projected market and macro-economic conditions. 
  If we intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, the entire difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and its fair value is recognized in earnings. As of   September 30, 2016  , for any securities with unrealized losses recorded in AOCI, we do not intend to sell, nor believe that we will be required to sell, these securities prior to recovery of their amortized cost. 

78 
    Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

Table of Contents  

For those securities that we do not intend to sell nor expect to be required to sell, an analysis is performed to determine if any of the impairment is due to credit-related factors or whether it is due to other factors, such as interest rates. Credit-related impairment is recognized in earnings, with the remaining unrealized non-credit-related impairment recorded in AOCI. We determine the credit component based on the difference between the security s amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected cash flows, discounted based on the effective yield. 
  The table below presents a rollforward of the credit-related OTTI recognized in earnings for   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   on investment securities for which we had no intent to sell.

NOTE 4 LOANS 

Loan Portfolio Composition 
  Our loan portfolio consists of loans held for investment, including loans held in our consolidated trusts, and loans held for sale, and is divided into three portfolio segments: credit card, consumer banking and commercial banking. Credit card loans consist of domestic and international credit card loans. Consumer banking loans consist of auto, home and retail banking loans. Commercial banking loans consist of commercial and multifamily real estate, commercial and industrial, and small-ticket commercial real estate loans. 
  Our portfolio of loans held for investment also includes certain of our consumer and commercial loans acquired through business combinations that were recorded at fair value at acquisition and subsequently accounted for based on cash flows expected to be collected, which are referred to as PCI loans. See    Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    in our   2015   Form 10-K for additional information on the accounting guidance for these loans. 
  Credit Quality 
  We closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to manage and evaluate our exposure to credit risk. Trends in delinquency rates are an indicator, among other considerations, of credit risk within our loan portfolio. The level of nonperforming loans represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. Accordingly, key metrics we track and use in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming loan rates, as well as net charge-off rates and our internal risk ratings of larger balance commercial loans.  
  The table below presents the composition and an aging analysis of our loans held for investment portfolio as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The delinquency aging includes all past due loans, both performing and nonperforming.

    We pledge loan collateral at the FHLB to secure borrowing capacity. The outstanding balance of the pledged loans totaled   $30.0 billion   and   $36.9   billion as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Table 4.2 presents the outstanding balance of loans 90 days or more past due that continue to accrue interest and loans classified as nonperforming as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

            (1)   
    Nonperfor  ming loans generally include loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status. PCI loans are excluded from loans reported as 90 days or more past due and accruing interest as well as nonperforming loans. See    Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies      in our   2015   Form 10-K   for additional information on our policies for nonperforming loans. 
     Credit Card 
  Our credit card loan portfolio is highly diversified across millions of accounts and numerous geographies without significant individual exposure. We therefore generally manage credit risk on a portfolio basis. The risk in our credit card loan portfolio correlates to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates and home values, as well as customer liquidity, all of which can have a material effect on credit performance. The primary factors we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our credit card portfolio are delinquency and charge-off trends, including an analysis of the migration of loans between delinquency categories over time. 
  The table below displays the geographic profile of our credit card loan portfolio as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . We also present net charge-offs for   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

 __________ 
            (1)   
    Net charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance that we determine to be uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. The net charge-off rate is calculated for each loan category by dividing   annualized   net charge-offs by average balance of loans held for investment for the period. Net charge-offs and the net charge-off rate are impacted periodically by fluctuations in recoveries, including loan sales. 
     Consumer Banking 
  Our consumer banking loan portfolio consists of auto, home and retail banking loans. Similar to our credit card loan portfolio, the risk in our consumer banking loan portfolio correlates to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates, gross domestic product ( GDP ) and home values, as well as customer liquidity, all of which can have a material effect on credit performance. Delinquency, nonperforming loans and charge-off trends are key factors we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our consumer banking loan portfolio.  
  The table below displays the geographic profile of our consumer banking loan portfolio, including PCI loans. We also present the delinquency and nonperforming loan rates of our consumer banking loan portfolio as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , as well as net charge-offs for   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

Home Loan 
  Our home loan portfolio consists of both first-lien and second-lien residential mortgage loans. In evaluating the credit quality and risk of our home loan portfolio, we continually monitor a variety of mortgage loan characteristics that may affect the default experience on this loan portfolio, such as vintage, geographic concentrations, lien priority and product type. Certain loan concentrations have experienced higher delinquency rates as a result of the significant decline in home prices after the peak in 2006 and subsequent rise in unemployment. These loan concentrations include loans originated between 2006 and 2008 in an environment of decreasing home sales, broadly declining home prices and more relaxed underwriting standards.  
  The following table presents the distribution of our home loan portfolio as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , based on selected key risk characteristics.

We commence the foreclosure process on home loans when a borrower becomes at least   120 days   delinquent in accordance with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau regulations. Foreclosure procedures and timelines vary according to state laws. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying value of the foreclosed residential real estate properties we hold and report as other assets on our consolidated balance sheets totaled   $75 million   and   $123 million  , respectively.

Commercial Banking 
  We evaluate the credit risk of commercial loans individually and use a risk-rating system to determine credit quality. We assign internal risk ratings to loans based on relevant information about the ability of the borrowers to repay their debt. In determining the risk rating of a particular loan, some of the factors considered are the borrower s current financial condition, historical and projected future credit performance, prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors, the estimated realizable value of any collateral and current economic trends. The scale based on our internal risk rating system is as follows: 
             
    Noncriticized:   Loans that have not been designated as criticized, frequently referred to as  pass  loans. 
                
    Criticized performing:   Loans in which the financial condition of the obligor is stressed, affecting earnings, cash flows or collateral values. The borrower currently has adequate capacity to meet near-term obligations; however, the stress, left unabated, may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects at some future date. 
                
    Criticized nonperforming:   Loans that are not adequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as criticized nonperforming have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, which jeopardize the full repayment of the debt. These loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain a credit loss if the deficiencies are not corrected and are generally placed on nonaccrual status. 
     We use our internal risk rating system for regulatory reporting, determining the frequency of credit exposure reviews, and evaluating and determining the allowance for loan and lease losses for commercial loans. Loans of   $1 million   or more that are designated as criticized performing and criticized nonperforming are reviewed quarterly by management to determine if they are appropriately classified/rated and whether any impairment exists. Noncriticized loans greater than   $1 million   are specifically reviewed, at least annually, to determine the appropriate risk rating. In addition, we evaluate the risk rating during the renewal process of any loan or if a loan becomes past due. 
  The following table presents the geographic distribution and internal risk ratings of our commercial loan portfolio as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

Northeast consists of CT, MA, ME, NH, NJ, NY, PA and VT. Mid-Atlantic consists of DC,   DE, MD, VA and WV. South consists of AL, AR, FL, GA, KY, LA, MO, MS, NC, SC, TN and TX.

    Impaired loans   include loans modified in troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ), all nonperforming commercial loans and nonperforming home loans with a specific impairment. Impaired loans without an allowance generally represent loans that have been charged down to the fair value of the underlying collateral for which we believe no additional losses have been incurred, or where the fair value of the underlying collateral meets or exceeds the loan s amortized cost. 
               (2)   
    The average recorded investment of credit card loans includes finance charges and fees. 
               (3)   
    Although auto loans from loan recovery inventory are not reported in our loans held for investment, they are included as impaired loans above since they are reported as TD  Rs. 
     The total recorded investment of loans modified in TDRs represents   $2.3 billion   and   $1.8 billion   of the impaired loans presented above as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Consumer TDRs classified as performing totaled   $1.1 billion   and   $1.0 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Commercial TDRs classified as performing totaled   $455 million   and   $334 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  As part of our loan modification programs to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, we may provide multiple concessions to minimize our economic loss and improve long-term loan performance and collectability. The following tables present the major modification types, recorded investment amounts and financial effects of loans modified in TDRs during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

    In the U.K., regulators require the acceptance of payment plan proposals in which the modified payments may be less than the contractual minimum amount.   As a result, loans entering long-term TDR payment programs in the U.K. typically continue to age and ultimately charge off even when fully in compliance with the TDR program terms.

     Unfunded Lending Commitments 
  We generally manage the potential risk of unfunded lending commitments by limiting the total amount of arrangements, monitoring the size and maturity structure of these portfolios and applying the same credit standards for all of our credit activities. Unused lines of credit for credit card customers totaled   $314.8 billion   and   $308.3 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. While these amounts represented the total available unused credit card lines, we have not experienced and do not anticipate that all of our customers will access their entire available line at any given point in time.

In addition to available unused credit card lines, we enter into commitments to extend credit that are legally binding conditional agreements having fixed expirations or termination dates and specified interest rates and purposes. These commitments generally require customers to maintain certain credit standards. Collateral requirements and loan-to-value ( LTV ) ratios are the same as those for funded transactions and are established based on management s credit assessment of the customer. These commitments may expire without being drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future funding requirements. The outstanding unfunded commitments to extend credit, other than credit card lines, were approximately   $28.0 billion   and   $27.9 billion  , which included   $745 million   and   $1.0 billion   of advised lines of credit as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Advised lines of credit are not considered legally binding commitments as funding is subject to our satisfactory evaluation of the customer at the time credit is requested.

NOTE 5 ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES AND RESERVE FOR UNFUNDED LENDING COMMITMENTS 

Our allowance for loan and lease losses represents management s best estimate of incurred loan and lease losses inherent in our loans held for investment portfolio as of each balance sheet date. In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments, such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and binding unfunded loan commitments. The provision for losses on unfunded lending commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income and the related reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. See    Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    of our 2015 Form 10-K for further discussion on the methodology and policy for determining our allowance for loan and lease losses for each of our loan portfolio segments, as well as information on our reserve for unfunded lending commitments.

Components of Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses by Impairment Methodology 
  The table below presents the components of our allowance for loan and lease losses by portfolio segment and impairment methodology with the recorded investment of the related loans as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  Table 5.2: Components of Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses by Impairment Methodology   
  
 __________ 
            (1)   
    The component of the allowance for loan and lease losses for credit card and other consumer loans that we collectively evaluate for impairment is based on a statistical calculation supplemented by management judgment and interpretation. The component of the allowance for loan and lease losses for commercial loans that we collectively evaluate for impairment is based on historical loss experience for loans with similar characteristics and consideration of credit quality supplemented by management judgment and interpretation. 
               (2)   
    The asset-specific component of the allowance for loan and lease losses for smaller-balance impaired loans is calculated on a pool basis using historical loss experience for the respective class of assets. The asset-specific component of the allowance for loan and lease losses for larger-balance commercial loans is individually calculated for each loan. 
               (3)   
    The PCI loans component of the allowance for loan and lease losses is accounted for based on expected cash flows. See    Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    in our 2015 Form 10-K for details on these loans.

NOTE 6 VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES AND SECURITIZATIONS 

In the normal course of business, we enter into various types of transactions with entities that are considered to be VIEs. Our primary involvement with VIEs has been related to our securitization transactions in which we transferred assets from our balance sheet to securitization trusts. We have primarily securitized credit card and home loans, which have provided a source of funding for us and enabled us to transfer a certain portion of the economic risk of the loans or related debt securities to third parties. 
  The entity that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is referred to as the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE. The majority of the VIEs in which we are involved have been consolidated in our financial statements. 
  Summary of Consolidated and Unconsolidated VIEs 
  The table below presents a summary of VIEs, aggregated based on VIEs with similar characteristics, in which we had continuing involvement or held a variable interest as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . We separately present information for consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs. 
  For consolidated VIEs, we present the carrying amount of assets and liabilities of the VIEs, which includes the seller s interest and repurchased notes held by other related parties. The assets of consolidated VIEs primarily consist of cash and loan receivables, which we report on our consolidated balance sheets under restricted cash and loans held in consolidated trusts, respectively. The assets of a particular VIE are the primary source of funds to settle its obligations. The creditors of the VIEs typically do not have recourse to the general credit of the Company. The liabilities primarily consist of debt securities issued by the VIEs, which we report under securitized debt obligations. For unconsolidated VIEs, we present the carrying amount of assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets and our maximum exposure to loss. Our maximum exposure to loss is estimated based on the unlikely event that all of the assets in the VIEs become worthless and we are required to meet our maximum remaining funding obligations.

    Represents the carrying amount of assets and liabilities owned by the VIE, which includes the seller s interest and repurchased notes held by other related parties. 
               (2)   
    The carrying amount of assets of unconsolidated securitization-related VIEs consists of retained interests associated with the securitization of option-adjustable rate mortgage ( option-ARM ) loans and letters of credit related to manufactured housing securitizations. These are reported on our consolidated balance sheets within other assets. The carrying amount of liabilities of unconsolidated securitization-related VIEs is comprised of obligations on certain swap agreements associated with the securitizations of manufactured housing loans and other obligations. These are reported on our consolidated balance sheets within other liabilities. 
     Securitization-Related VIEs 
  In a securitization transaction, assets from our balance sheet are transferred to a trust we establish, which typically meets the definition of a VIE. Our continuing involvement in the majority of our securitization transactions consists primarily of holding certain retained interests and acting as the primary servicer on certain transactions. We also may have exposure associated with contractual obligations to repurchase previously transferred loans due to breaches of representations and warranties. See    Note 14 Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others    for information related to reserves we have established for our mortgage representation and warranty exposure.

The table below presents the securitization-related VIEs in which we had continuing involvement as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  Table 6.2: Continuing Involvement in Securitization-Related VIEs   
 __________ 
            (1)   
    We continue to service only certain option-ARM securitizations. 
               (2)   
    The core servicing activities for the manufactured housing securitizations are completed by a third party. 
               (3)   
    Amortization events vary according to each specific trust agreement but generally are triggered by declines in performance or credit metrics of the underlying assets, such as net charge-off rates or delinquency rates, beyond certain predetermined thresholds. Generally, the occurrence of an amortization event changes the sequencing and amount of trust-related cash flows to the benefit of more senior interest holders. 
     Credit Card Securitizations 
  We hold certain retained interests in our credit card securitizations and continue to service the receivables in these trusts. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we were deemed to be the primary beneficiary, and accordingly, all of these trusts have been consolidated in our financial statements.  
  Mortgage Securitizations 
  Option-ARM Loans 
  We had previously securitized option-ARM loans by transferring these loans to securitization trusts that had issued mortgage-backed securities to investors. The outstanding balance of debt securities held by third-party investors related to these mortgage loan securitization trusts was   $1.6 billion   and   $1.8 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  We continue to service a portion of the remaining mortgage loans in these securitizations. We also retain rights to future cash flows arising from these securitizations, the most significant being certificated interest-only bonds issued by the trusts. We generally estimate the fair value of these retained interests based on the estimated present value of expected future cash flows, using our best estimates of the key assumptions which include credit losses, prepayment speeds and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. For the mortgage loans that we continue to service, we do not consolidate the related trusts because we do not have the right to receive benefits nor the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts. For the remaining trusts, for which we no longer service the underlying mortgage loans, we do not consolidate these entities since we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts.

    Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

Table of Contents  

In connection with the securitization of certain option-ARM loans, a third party is obligated to advance a portion of any  negative amortization  resulting from monthly payments that are less than the interest accrued for that payment period. We have an agreement in place with the third party that mirrors this advance requirement. The amount advanced is tracked through mortgage-backed     securities retained as part of the securitization transaction. As advances occur, we record an asset in the form of negative amortization bonds, which are held at fair value in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Our maximum exposure is affected by rate caps and monthly payment change caps, but the funding obligation cannot exceed the difference between the original loan balance multiplied by a preset negative amortization cap and the current unpaid principal balance.  
  We have also entered into certain derivative contracts related to the securitization activities. These are classified as free-standing derivatives, with fair value adjustments recorded in non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income. See    Note 9 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities    for further details on these derivatives. 
  GreenPoint Mortgage Home Equity Lines of Credit ( HELOCs ) 
  Our discontinued wholesale mortgage banking unit, GreenPoint Mortgage Funding Inc. ( GreenPoint ), previously sold HELOCs in whole loan sales that were subsequently securitized by third parties. GreenPoint acquired residual interests in certain of those securitization trusts. We do not consolidate these trusts because we either lack the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts or because we do not have the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts. As the residual interest holder, GreenPoint is required to fund advances on the HELOCs when certain performance triggers are met due to deterioration in asset performance. On behalf of GreenPoint, we have funded cumulative advances of   $30 million   as of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . These advances are generally expensed as funded due to the low likelihood of recovery. We also have unfunded commitments of   $5 million   and   $6 million   related to those interests for our non-consolidated VIEs as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  GreenPoint Credit Manufactured Housing 
  We have retained certain interests and obligations related to the discontinued manufactured housing operations of GreenPoint Credit, LLC, a subsidiary of GreenPoint. Such discontinued operations, including the related recourse obligations, servicing rights and the primary obligation to execute mandatory clean-up calls in certain securitization transactions were sold to a third party in 2004. We do not consolidate these securitization trusts because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts as we no longer service the loans. 
  The unpaid principal balance of manufactured housing securitization transactions where we are the residual interest holder was   $724 million   and   $794 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. In the event the third party servicer does not fulfill its obligation to exercise the clean-up calls on certain securitizations, the obligation reverts to us and we would be required to acquire a maximum of approximately   $420 million   of loan receivables and other assets upon our execution of these clean-up calls with the requirement to absorb any losses on the loan receivables and other assets. See    Note 14 Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others    for information related to these obligations.  
  We were required to fund letters of credit to cover losses on certain manufactured housing securitizations. We have the right to receive any funds remaining in the letters of credit after the securities are released. The fair value of these letters of credit are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets and totaled   $83 million   and   $76 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. We also have credit exposure on agreements that we entered into to absorb a portion of the risk of loss on certain manufactured housing securitizations not subject to the funded letters of credit. Our maximum credit exposure related to these agreements totaled   $12 million   and   $13 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. These agreements are included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, and our obligation under these agreements was   $7 million   and   $8 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Other VIEs 
  Affordable Housing Entities 
  As part of our community reinvestment initiatives, we invest in private investment funds that make equity investments in multi-family affordable housing properties. We receive affordable housing tax credits for these investments. The activities of these entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt.  

105 
    Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

Table of Contents  

We account for certain of our investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method if certain criteria are met. The proportional amortization method amortizes the cost of the investment over the period in which the investor expects to receive tax credits and other tax benefits, and the resulting amortization is recognized as a component of income tax expense attributable to continuing operations. For   the nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recognized amortization of   $295 million   and   $257 million  , respectively, and tax credits of   $336 million   and   $387 million  , respectively, associated with these investments within income tax provision. The carrying value of our investments in these qualified affordable housing projects was   $3.8 billion   and   $3.5 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. We are periodically required to provide additional financial or other support during the period of the investments. We had a recorded liability of   $1.3 billion   for these unfunded commitments as of both   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , which is expected to be paid from   2016   to   2019  . 
  For those investment funds considered to be VIEs, we are not required to consolidate them if we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of those entities. We record our interests in these unconsolidated VIEs in loans held for investment, other assets and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our interests consisted of assets of approximately   $3.9 billion   as of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Our maximum exposure to these entities is limited to our variable interests in the entities of   $3.9 billion   as of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our general credit and we do not provide additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it. The total assets of the unconsolidated VIE investment funds were   $11.5 billion   and   $11.4 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Entities that Provide Capital to Low-Income and Rural Communities  
  We hold variable interests in entities ( Investor Entities ) that invest in community development entities ( CDEs ) that provide debt financing to businesses and non-profit entities in low-income and rural communities. Variable interests in the CDEs held by the consolidated Investor Entities are also our variable interests. The activities of the Investor Entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt. The activities of the CDEs are financed solely with invested equity capital. We receive federal and state tax credits for these investments. We consolidate the VIEs in which we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and where we have the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE. We have also consolidated other investments and CDEs that are not considered to be VIEs, but where we hold a controlling financial interest. The assets of the VIEs that we consolidated, which totaled approximately   $789 million   and   $352 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets in cash, loans held for investment, interest receivable and other assets. The liabilities are reflected in other liabilities. The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our general credit. We have not provided additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it. 
  Other 
  Other VIEs include variable interests that we hold in companies that promote renewable energy sources and other equity method investments. We were not required to consolidate these entities because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance. Our maximum exposure to these entities is limited to the investment on our consolidated balance sheets of   $64 million   and   $57 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The creditors of the other VIEs have no recourse to our general credit. We have not provided additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it.

NOTE 8 DEPOSITS AND BORROWINGS 

Deposits 
  Our deposits, which are our largest source of funding for our assets and operations, consist of non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits, which include checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, negotiable order of withdrawals, savings deposits and time deposits. 

Securitized and Unsecured Debt Obligations 
  In addition to our deposits, which serve as our primary funding source, we use a variety of other funding sources including short-term borrowings, the issuance of senior and subordinated notes and other borrowings, and securitization transactions. In addition, we utilize FHLB advances, which are secured by certain portions of our loan and investment securities portfolios, for our funding needs. The securitized debt obligations are separately presented on our consolidated balance sheets as they represent obligations of consolidated securitization trusts, while federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, senior and subordinated notes and other borrowings, including FHLB advances, are included in other debt on our consolidated balance sheets. 
  Securitized Debt Obligations 
  Our outstanding borrowings due to securitization investors   increased   to   $18.4 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  , from   $16.2 billion   as of   December 31, 2015  . During   the first nine months of 2016  , approximately   $5.0 billion   of new debt was issued to third-party investors from our credit card loan securitization trust offset by   $2.8 billion   of debt retirement. 
  Senior and Subordinated Notes 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $24.0 billion   of senior and subordinated notes outstanding, inclusive of fair value hedging adjustments of   $238 million  . As of   December 31, 2015  , we had   $21.8 billion   of senior and subordinated notes outstanding, inclusive of fair value hedging adjustments of   $134 million  . During   the first nine months of 2016  , we issued   $4.1 billion   of long-term senior and subordinated unsecured debt comprised of   $300 million   of floating-rate notes and   $3.8 billion   of fixed-rate notes. During   the first nine months of 2016  ,   $2.3 billion   of outstanding unsecured notes were retired. See    Note 9 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities    for information about our fair value hedging activities. 
  FHLB Advances and Other 
  We have access to funding through the FHLB system and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Our FHLB and Federal Reserve memberships require us to hold FHLB and Federal Reserve stock which totaled   $1.9 billion   and   $2.1 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. 
  Our FHLB advances and lines of credit are secured by our investment securities, residential home loans, multifamily real estate loans, commercial real estate loans and HELOCs. The outstanding FHLB advances totaled   $16.3 billion   and   $20.1 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, substantially all of which represented long-term advances generally callable on either a   one-month or a three-month   basis. We did not access the Federal Reserve Discount Window for funding during 2015 or   the first nine months of 2016  . 
  Composition of Deposits, Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt 
  The table below summarizes the components of our deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Our total short-term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase and other short-term borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less. Our long-term debt consists of borrowings with an original contractual maturity of greater than one year. The amounts presented for outstanding borrowings include unamortized debt premiums and discounts, net of debt issuance costs and fair value hedge accounting adjustments.

NOTE 9 DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 

Use of Derivatives 
  We manage asset and liability positions and market risk exposure and limits in accordance with market risk management policies that are approved by our Board of Directors. Our primary market risks stem from the impact on our earnings and economic value of equity from changes in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, changes in foreign exchange rates. We employ several techniques to manage our interest rate sensitivity, which include changing the duration and re-pricing characteristics of various assets and liabilities by using interest rate derivatives. Our current policies also include the use of derivatives to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currency so we may limit our earnings and capital ratio exposures to foreign exchange risk. We execute our derivative contracts in both the over-the-counter ( OTC ) and exchange-traded derivative markets, and clear eligible derivative transactions through Central Counterparty Clearinghouses ( CCPs ) or often referred to as  central clearinghouses  as required under the Dodd-Frank Act. The majority of our derivatives are interest rate swaps. In addition, we may use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks. We offer various interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity derivatives as an accommodation to our customers within our Commercial Banking business, and usually offset our exposure through derivative transactions with other counterparties. 
  Accounting for Derivatives 
  Our derivatives are designated as either qualifying accounting hedges or free-standing derivatives. Qualifying accounting hedges are designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges. Free-standing derivatives primarily consist of customer-accommodation derivatives and economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting.  
             
    Fair Value Hedges:   We designate derivatives as fair value hedges when they are used to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities, which fluctuate in value as a result of movements in interest rates. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded in earnings together with offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item and any resulting ineffectiveness. Our fair value hedges consist of interest rate swaps that are intended to modify our exposure to interest rate risk on various fixed-rate assets and liabilities.  
                
    Cash Flow Hedges:   We designate derivatives as cash flow hedges when they are used to manage our exposure to variability in cash flows related to forecasted transactions. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of AOCI, to the extent that the hedge relationships are effective, and amounts are reclassified from AOCI to earnings as the forecasted transactions impact earnings. To the extent that any ineffectiveness exists in the hedge relationships, the amounts are recorded in current period earnings. Our cash flow hedges use interest rate swaps and floors that are intended to hedge the variability in interest receipts or interest payments on some of our variable-rate assets or liabilities. We also enter into foreign currency forward derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to intercompany borrowings denominated in foreign currency.  
                
    Net Investment Hedges:   We use net investment hedges to manage the foreign currency exposure related to our net investments in foreign operations that have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recorded in the translation adjustment component of AOCI, offsetting the translation gain or loss from those foreign operations. We execute net investment hedges using foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the translation exposure of the net investment in our foreign operations. 
                
    Free-Standing Derivatives:   We use free-standing derivatives to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of residential MSRs, mortgage loan origination and purchase commitments and other interests held. We also categorize our customer accommodation derivatives and the related offsetting contracts as free-standing derivatives. Changes in the fair value of free-standing derivatives are recorded in earnings as a component of other non-interest income.

Balance Sheet Presentation 
  The following table summarizes the notional and fair values of our derivative instruments on a gross basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , which are segregated by derivatives that are designated as accounting hedges and those that are not, and are further segregated by type of contract within those two categories. The total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and any associated cash collateral received or paid.

     Offsetting of Financial Assets and Liabilities  
  Derivative contracts and repurchase agreements that we execute bilaterally in the OTC market are governed by enforceable master netting arrangements where we generally have the right to offset exposure with the same counterparty.  Either counterparty can generally request to net settle all contracts through a single payment upon default on, or termination of, any one contract. We elect to offset the derivative assets and liabilities under netting arrangements for balance sheet presentation where a right of setoff exists. Derivative contracts that are cleared with central clearinghouses through our Future Commission Merchants ( FCMs ) are not subject to offsetting due to the uncertainty existing around an end-user s ability to setoff these derivative contracts. Therefore, as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, we did not offset our derivative positions cleared through clearinghouses.

    Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

Table of Contents  

We also maintain collateral agreements with certain derivative counterparties. For bilateral derivatives, we review our collateral positions on a daily basis and exchange collateral with our counterparties in accordance with standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association documentation and other related agreements. Agreements with certain bilateral counterparties require both parties to maintain collateral in the event the fair values of derivative instruments exceed established exposure thresholds. For centrally cleared derivatives, we are subject to initial margin posting and daily variation margin exchange with the central clearinghouses. Acceptable types of collateral are typically in the form of cash or high quality liquid securities.    
  The exchange of collateral is dependent upon the fair value of the derivative instruments as well as the fair value of the pledged collateral. When valuing collateral, an estimate of the variation in price and liquidity over time is subtracted in the form of a  haircut  to discount the value of the collateral pledged.    
  The following table presents as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   the gross and net fair values of our derivative assets and liabilities and repurchase agreements, as well as the related offsetting amounts permitted under U.S. GAAP. The table also includes cash and non-cash collateral received or pledged associated with such arrangements. The collateral amounts shown are limited to the extent of the related net derivative fair values or outstanding balances, thus instances of over-collateralization are not shown.

Credit Risk-Related Contingency Features and Collateral 
  Certain of our derivative contracts include provisions requiring that our debt maintain a credit rating of investment grade or above by each of the major credit rating agencies. In the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating below investment grade, some of our derivative counterparties would have the right to terminate the derivative contract and close out the existing positions, or demand immediate and ongoing full overnight collateralization on derivative instruments in a net liability position. Certain of our derivative contracts may also allow, in the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating of any kind, our derivative counterparties to demand additional collateralization on such derivative instruments in a net liability position.   We posted   $190 million   and   $304 million   of cash collateral as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. If our debt credit rating were to fall below investment grade, we would be required to post   $62 million   and   $55 million   of additional collateral as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The fair value of derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features in a net liability position was less than   $1 million   as of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  Derivatives Counterparty Credit Risk  
  Derivative instruments contain an element of credit risk that arises from the potential failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of the contract. Our exposure to derivative counterparty credit risk, at any point in time, is represented by the fair value of derivatives in a gain position, or derivative asset position, assuming no recoveries of underlying collateral.   We also engage in certain foreign exchange derivatives that may give rise to counterparty settlement risk.   To mitigate the risk of counterparty default, we enter into legally enforceable master netting agreements and also maintain collateral agreements, where possible, with certain derivative counterparties.   We generally enter into these agreements on a bilateral basis with our counterparties.   These bilateral agreements typically provide for the right to offset exposures and require both parties to maintain collateral in the event the fair values of derivative instruments exceed established thresholds.   However, since June 2013 we have begun to clear eligible OTC derivatives through a central clearinghouse in accordance with the requirements under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. We received cash collateral from derivative counterparties totaling   $705 million   and   $544 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. We also received securities from derivative counterparties with a fair value of   $38 million   and   $172 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which we have the ability to re-pledge.  
  The regulatory requirement to clear eligible derivatives with central clearinghouses effectively reduces our overall counterparty credit exposure. It however increases our credit exposure to   CCPs and FCMs.   We are required to execute Cleared Derivatives Execution Agreements with each of our FCMs. The use of FCMs also helps mitigate operational risks. Certain of our agreements governing derivative transactions include provisions that may require us to post more collateral or otherwise change terms in our agreements under certain circumstances. We will be subject to rules governing the collateralization of uncleared, OTC derivatives when they become effective in 2017.     
  We record counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments on our OTC derivative contracts to properly reflect the credit quality of the counterparty. We consider collateral and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate our credit exposure to each counterparty in determining the counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment, which may be adjusted in future periods due to changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts, collateral and creditworthiness of the counterparty.   The cumulative counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as a reduction to the derivative asset balance was   $9 million   and   $4 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. We also adjust the fair value of our derivative liabilities to reflect the impact of our own credit quality. We calculate this adjustment by comparing the spreads on our credit default swaps to the discount benchmark curve. The cumulative credit risk valuation adjustment related to our credit quality recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as a reduction in the derivative liability balance was less than   $1 million   as of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

In the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify to earnings net after-tax gains of   $157 million   currently recorded in AOCI as of   September 30, 2016  . These amounts will offset the cash flows associated with the hedged forecasted transactions. The maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions were hedged was approximately   six   years as of   September 30, 2016  . The amount we expect to reclassify into earnings may change as a result of changes in market conditions and ongoing actions taken as part of our overall risk management strategy.

NOTE 12 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT 

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date (also referred to as an exit price). The fair value accounting guidance provides a three-level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments. This hierarchy is based on the markets in which the assets or liabilities trade and whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable. The fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: 
                   Level 1: 
      
    Valuation is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
      Level 2: 
      
    Valuation is based on observable market-based inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or models using inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data of substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
      Level 3: 
      
    Valuation is generated from techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. Valuation techniques include pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques. 

The accounting guidance for fair value measurements requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in determining fair value. The accounting guidance provides for the irrevocable option to elect, on a contract-by-contract basis, to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value at inception of the contract and record any subsequent changes in fair value in earnings. We have not made any material fair value option elections as of or for the periods disclosed herein. 
  For additional information on the valuation techniques used in estimating the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities on a recurring or nonrecurring basis and for estimating the fair value for financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value, see  Note 19 Fair Value Measurement  in our 2015 Form 10-K. 
  Fair Value Governance and Control 
  We have a governance framework and a number of key controls that are intended to ensure that our fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable. Our governance framework provides for independent oversight and segregation of duties. Our control processes include review and approval of new transaction types, price verification and review of valuation judgments, methods, models, process controls and results.  
  Groups independent of our trading and investing functions, including our Corporate Valuations Group ( CVG ), Fair Value Committee ( FVC ) and Model Validation Group ( MVG ), participate in the review and validation process.  
  The CVG, which is independent of the front office and the valuation providers, performs periodic verification of fair value measurements to determine if assigned fair values are reasonable. Prices based on third party pricing providers are checked against available market information including prices from other market sources. 
  The FVC, which includes representation from business areas, our Risk Management and Finance functions, provides guidance and oversight to ensure an appropriate valuation control environment. The FVC regularly reviews and approves changes in valuation methodologies to ensure that our valuation practices are consistent with industry standards and adhere to regulatory and accounting guidance.  
  We have a model policy, established by an independent Model Risk Office, which governs the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for pricing. The MVG is part of the Model Risk Office and validates all models and provides ongoing monitoring of their performance. 
  The fair valuation governance process is set up in a manner that allows the Chairperson of the FVC to escalate valuation disputes that cannot be resolved by the FVC to a more senior committee called the Valuations Advisory Committee ( VAC ) for resolution. The VAC is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and includes other members of senior management. The VAC is only required to convene to review escalated valuation disputes.

    The balances represent gross derivative amounts and are not reduced by the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to net positive and negative positions and the related payables and receivables for cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparty. The net derivative assets were   $1.9 billion   and   $986 million  , and the net derivative liabilities were   $500 million   and   $377 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. See    Note 9 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities    for further information.

Non-performance risk is reflected in other assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and offset through non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income.  
               (3)   
    Includes consumer MSRs of   $62 million   and   $68 million  , retained interests in securitizations of   $205 million   and   $211 million   and deferred compensation plan assets of   $206 million   and   $183 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Consumer MSRs and retained interests in securitizations are both classified within Level 3. Deferred compensation plan assets, which consist of investments in publicly traded mutual funds, are classified within Level 1. 
     The determination of the classification of financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy is performed at the end of each reporting period. We consider all available information, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs. Based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category, judgments are made regarding the significance of the unobservable inputs to the instruments  fair value measurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. The process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions. During   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we had minimal movements between Levels 1 and 2. 
  Level 3 Recurring Fair Value Rollforward 
  The table below presents a reconciliation for all assets and liabilities measured and recognized at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . When assets and liabilities are transferred between levels, we recognize the transfer as of the end of the period.

    During   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the transfers into Level 3 were primarily driven by less consistency among vendor pricing on individual securities, while the transfers out of Level 3 were primarily driven by greater consistency among multiple pricing sources.

    The amount presented for unrealized gains (losses) for assets still held as of the reporting date primarily represents impairments of securities available for sale, accretion on certain fixed maturity securities, changes in fair value of derivative instruments and mortgage servicing rights transactions. Impairment is reported in total OTTI, which is a component of non-interest income, in our consolidated statements of income. 
               (4)   
    All Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis and are not reduced by the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to net positive and negative positions and the related payables and receivables for cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparty.  
     Significant Level 3 Fair Value Asset and Liability Input Sensitivity 
  Changes in unobservable inputs may have a significant impact on fair value. Certain of these unobservable inputs will, in isolation, have a directionally consistent impact on the fair value of the instrument for a given change in that input. Alternatively, the fair value of the instrument may move in an opposite direction for a given change in another input. In general, an increase in the discount rate, default rates, loss severity and credit spreads, in isolation, would result in a decrease in the fair value measurement. In addition, an increase in default rates would generally be accompanied by a decrease in recovery rates, slower prepayment rates and an increase in liquidity spreads. 
  Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value Measurements 
  The following table presents the significant unobservable inputs relied upon to determine the fair values of our Level 3 financial instruments on a recurring basis. We utilize multiple third-party pricing services to obtain fair value measures for our securities. Several of our third-party pricing services are only able to provide unobservable input information for a limited number of securities due to software licensing restrictions. Other third-party pricing services are able to provide unobservable input information for all securities for which they provide a valuation. As a result, the unobservable input information for the securities available for sale presented below represents a composite summary of all information we are able to obtain for a majority of our securities. The unobservable input information for all other Level 3 financial instruments is based on the assumptions used in our internal valuation models.

    All Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis and are not reduced by the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to net positive and negative positions and the related payables and receivables for cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparty.  
               (2)   
    Due to the nature of the various mortgage securitization structures in which we have retained interests, it is not meaningful to present a consolidated weighted average for the significant unobservable inputs. 
     Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
  We are required to measure and recognize certain other assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on the consolidated balance sheets. These assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, from the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or when we evaluate for impairment). The following table presents the carrying amount of the assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and still held as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , and for which a nonrecurring fair value measurement was recorded during the nine and twelve months then ended:

    Includes foreclosed property and repossessed assets of   $41 million   and long-lived assets held for sale of   $21 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to foreclosed property and repossessed assets of   $54 million   and long-lived assets held for sale of   $38 million   as of   December 31, 2015  . 
     In the above table, loans held for investment primarily include nonperforming loans for which specific reserves or charge-offs have been recognized. These loans are classified as Level 3 as they are valued based in part on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral and the non-recoverable rate, which is considered to be a significant unobservable input. Collateral fair value sources include the appraisal value obtained from independent appraisers, broker pricing opinions or other available market information. The non-recoverable rate ranged from   0%   to   81%  , with a weighted average of   27%  , and from   9%   to   73%  , with a weighted average of   20%  , as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The fair value of the other assets classified as Level 3 is determined based on appraisal value or listing price which involves significant judgment; the significant unobservable inputs and related quantitative information are not meaningful to disclose as they vary significantly across properties and collateral.

NOTE 13 BUSINESS SEGMENTS 

Our principal operations are currently organized into   three   major business segments, which are defined based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group, are included in the Other category. 

Basis of Presentation 
  We report the results of each of our business segments on a continuing operations basis. See    Note 2 Discontinued Operations    for a discussion of our discontinued operations. The results of our individual businesses reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources.  
  Business Segment Reporting Methodology 
  The results of our business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. Our internal management and reporting process used to derive our segment results employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. Our funds transfer pricing process provides a funds credit for sources of funds, such as deposits generated by our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses, and a funds charge for the use of funds by each segment. Due to the integrated nature of our business segments, estimates and judgments have been made in allocating certain revenue and expense items. Transactions between segments are based on specific criteria or approximate third-party rates. We regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods. We provide additional information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in  Note 20 Business Segments  in our 2015 Form 10-K. 
  Segment Results and Reconciliation  
  We may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment. The following tables present our business segment results for   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , selected balance sheet data as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated income from continuing operations, loans held for investment and deposits.

    Some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits. Accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory tax rate of   35%   with offsetting reclassifications to the Other category.

NOTE 14 COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES, GUARANTEES AND OTHERS 

Letters of Credit, Loss Sharing Agreements and Other Obligations 
  We issue letters of credit (financial standby, performance standby and commercial) to meet the financing needs of our customers. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party in a borrowing arrangement. Commercial letters of credit are short-term commitments issued primarily to facilitate trade finance activities for customers and are generally collateralized by the goods being shipped to the client. These collateral requirements are similar to those for funded transactions and are established based on management s credit assessment of the customer. Management conducts regular reviews of all outstanding letters of credit and the results of these reviews are considered in assessing the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses. 
  We had standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit with contractual amounts of   $2.0 billion   and   $1.9 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The carrying value of outstanding letters of credit, which we include in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets was   $4 million   and   $3 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. These financial guarantees had expiration dates ranging from   2016   to   2025   as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  Within our Commercial Banking business, we originate multifamily commercial real estate loans with the intent to sell them to a government-sponsored enterprise ( GSE ). We enter into loss sharing agreements with the GSE upon the sale of the loans. At inception, we record a liability representing the fair value of our obligation which is subsequently amortized as we are released from risk of payment under the loss sharing agreement. If payment under the loss sharing agreement becomes probable and estimable, an additional liability may be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets and a non-interest expense may be recognized in the consolidated statements of income. The amount of liability recognized on our consolidated balance sheets for our loss sharing agreements was   $46 million   and   $40 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
  In certain securitizations in connection with the discontinued manufactured housing operations of GreenPoint Credit, LLC, the third party servicer has an obligation to exercise mandatory clean-up calls. In the event the third party servicer does not fulfill its obligation to exercise these clean-up calls, the obligation reverts to us. The amount of loan receivables and other assets subject to these clean-up calls is approximately   $420 million  . Based on our current projections, we expect these securitizations to reach their individual clean-up call thresholds beginning in 2017 and continuing through 2019. According to current information and estimates, we also expect the fair value of the loan receivables and other assets to be less than the contractual amount required to exercise the clean-up calls. We monitor the underlying assets for trends in delinquencies and related losses and review the third party servicer s financial strength. As of September 30, 2016, our best estimate is that any reasonably possible future losses associated with these clean-up call obligations are not significant to the Company s financial position. 
  U.K. Cross Sell 
  In the U.K., we previously sold payment protection insurance ( PPI ) and other ancillary cross sell products. In response to an elevated level of customer complaints across the industry, heightened media coverage and pressure from consumer advocacy groups, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority ( FCA ), formerly the Financial Services Authority, investigated and raised concerns about the way the industry has handled complaints related to the sale of these insurance policies. For the past several years, the U.K. s Financial Ombudsman Service ( FOS ) has been adjudicating customer complaints relating to PPI, escalated to it by consumers who disagree with the rejection of their complaint by firms, leading to customer remediation payments by us and others within the industry. On October 2, 2015, the FCA issued a Statement on PPI ( FCA Proposal ) announcing it has decided to consult on the introduction of a time bar for PPI complaints and on new rules and guidance about how banks should handle unfair relationship PPI complaints covered by s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act of 1974 ( Consumer Credit Act ). Following feedback on the FCA Proposal, the FCA issued a further Consultation Paper on August 2, 2016, providing additional guidance on how banks should handle unfair relationship PPI complaints and indicating an expectation that the complaint deadline will fall by the end of June 2019. 
  In determining our best estimate of incurred losses for future remediation payments, management considers numerous factors, including (i) the number of customer complaints we expect in the future; (ii) our expectation of upholding those complaints; (iii) the expected number of complaints customers escalate to the FOS; (iv) our expectation of the FOS upholding such escalated complaints; (v) the number of complaints that fall under the s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act; and (vi) the estimated remediation payout to customers. We monitor these factors each quarter and adjust our reserves to reflect the latest data.

Management s best estimate of incurred losses related to U.K. cross sell products, including PPI, totaled   $221 million   and   $176 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. In   the third quarter of 2016  , we added   $63 million   to our reserve in response to the August 2, 2016 Consultation Paper. Other movements to the reserve were a combination of utilization of the reserve through customer refund payments and foreign exchange movements. Our best estimate of reasonably possible future losses beyond our reserve as of   September 30, 2016   is approximately   $250 million  . 
  Mortgage Representation and Warranty Liabilities 
  We acquired   three   subsidiaries that originated residential mortgage loans and sold these loans to various purchasers, including purchasers who created securitization trusts. These subsidiaries are Capital One Home Loans, LLC, which was acquired in February 2005; GreenPoint, which was acquired in December 2006 as part of the North Fork acquisition; and CCB, which was acquired in February 2009 and subsequently merged into CONA (collectively, the  subsidiaries ). 
  In connection with their sales of mortgage loans, the subsidiaries entered into agreements containing varying representations and warranties about, among other things, the ownership of the loan, the validity of the lien securing the loan, the loan s compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the purchaser, including underwriting guidelines and the existence of mortgage insurance, and the loan s compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws. The representations and warranties do not address the credit performance of the mortgage loans, but mortgage loan performance often influences whether a claim for breach of representation and warranty will be asserted and has an effect on the amount of any loss in the event of a breach of a representation or warranty. 
  Each of these subsidiaries may be required to repurchase mortgage loans in the event of certain breaches of these representations and warranties. In the event of a repurchase, the subsidiary is typically required to pay the unpaid principal balance of the loan together with interest and certain expenses (including, in certain cases, legal costs incurred by the purchaser and/or others). The subsidiary then recovers the loan or, if the loan has been foreclosed, the underlying collateral. The subsidiary is exposed to any losses on the repurchased loans, taking into account any recoveries on the collateral. In some instances, rather than repurchase the loans, a subsidiary may agree to make cash payments to make a purchaser whole on losses or to settle repurchase claims, possibly including claims for attorneys  fees and interest. In addition, our subsidiaries may be required to indemnify certain purchasers and others against losses they incur as a result of certain breaches of representations and warranties. 
  These subsidiaries, in total, originated and sold to non-affiliates approximately   $111 billion   original principal balance of mortgage loans between 2005 and 2008, which are the years (or  vintages ) with respect to which our subsidiaries have received the vast majority of the repurchase-related requests and other related claims. 
  The following table presents the original principal balance of mortgage loan originations, by vintage for 2005 through 2008, for the three general categories of purchasers of mortgage loans and the estimated unpaid principal balance as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 
  Table 14.1: Unpaid Principal Balance of Mortgage Loans Originated and Sold to Third Parties Based on Category of Purchaser      

  Of the   $20 billion   in original principal balance of mortgage loans sold directly by our subsidiaries to private-label purchasers who placed the loans into securitizations supported by bond insurance ( Insured Securitizations ), approximately   48%   of the original principal balance was covered by bond insurance. Further, approximately   $16 billion   original principal balance was placed in securitizations as to which the monoline bond insurers have made repurchase-related requests or loan file requests to one of our subsidiaries ( Active Insured Securitizations ) and the remaining approximately   $4 billion   original principal balance was placed in securitizations as to which the monoline bond insurers have not made repurchase-related requests or loan file requests to one of our subsidiaries ( Inactive Insured Securitizations ). Insured Securitizations often allow the monoline bond insurer to act

Table of Contents  

independently of the investors. Bond insurers typically have indemnity agreements directly with both the mortgage originators and the securitizers, and they often have super-majority rights within the trust documentation that allow them to direct trustees to pursue mortgage repurchase-related requests without coordination with other investors. 
  Because we do not service most of the loans our subsidiaries sold to others, we do not have complete information about the current ownership of a portion of the   $80 billion   in original principal balance of mortgage loans not sold directly to GSEs or placed in Insured Securitizations. We have determined based on information obtained from third-party databases that about   $48 billion   original principal balance of these mortgage loans was placed in private-label publicly issued securitizations not supported by bond insurance ( Uninsured Securitizations ). An additional approximately   $22 billion   original principal balance of mortgage loans were initially sold to private investors as whole loans. Various known and unknown investors purchased the remaining   $10 billion   original principal balance of mortgage loans. 
  With respect to the   $111 billion   in original principal balance of mortgage loans originated and sold to others between 2005 and 2008, we estimate that approximately   $18 billion   in unpaid principal balance remains outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  , of which approximately   $3 billion   in unpaid principal balance is at least   90 days   delinquent. Approximately   $22 billion   in losses have been realized by third parties. Because we do not service most of the loans we sold to others, we do not have complete information about the underlying credit performance levels for some of these mortgage loans. These amounts reflect our best estimates, including extrapolations of underlying credit performance where necessary. These estimates could change as we get additional data or refine our analysis. 
  The subsidiaries had open repurchase-related requests with regard to approximately   $1.4 billion   original principal balance of mortgage loans as of   September 30, 2016  , flat from   December 31, 2015  . Currently, repurchase-related demands predominantly relate to the 2006 and 2007 vintages. We have received relatively few repurchase-related demands for vintages after 2007, mostly because GreenPoint ceased originating mortgages in August 2007. 
  The following table presents information on pending repurchase-related requests by counterparty category and timing of initial request. The amounts presented are based on original loan principal balances. 
  Table 14.2: Open Pipeline All Vintages (All Entities)   (1)    
 __________ 
            (1)   
    The open pipeline includes all timely repurchase-related requests ever received by our subsidiaries where the requesting party has not formally rescinded the repurchase-related request or our subsidiary has not agreed to either repurchase the loan at issue or make the requesting party whole with respect to its losses. The demands rescinded in 2015 reflect the ruling from New York s highest court in June 2015 that the statute of limitations for repurchase claims begins when the relevant representations and warranties were made, as opposed to some later date during the life of the loan. Finally, the amounts reflected in this chart are the original principal balance amounts of the mortgage loans at issue and do not correspond to the losses our subsidiary would incur upon the repurchase of these loans.

            (1)   
    Reflects, in billions, the total original principal balance of loans originated by our subsidiaries and sold to third-party investors between 2005 and 2008. 
       
  We established reserves for the   $11 billion   original principal balance of GSE loans, based on open claims and historic repurchase rates. We have entered into and completed repurchase or settlement agreements with respect to the majority of our repurchase exposure within this category.  
  Our reserves could also be impacted by any claims which may be brought by governmental agencies under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act ( FIRREA ), the False Claims Act or other federal or state statutes. For example, GreenPoint and Capital One have received requests for information and/or subpoenas from various governmental regulators and law enforcement authorities, including members of the RMBS Working Group, relating to the origination of loans for sale to the GSEs and to RMBS participants. We are cooperating with these regulators and other authorities in responding to such requests. 
  For the   $16 billion   original principal balance in Active Insured Securitizations, our reserving approach is based upon the expected resolution of litigation with the monoline bond insurers. Accordingly, our representation and warranty reserves for this category are litigation reserves. In establishing litigation reserves for this category, we consider the current and future monoline insurer losses inherent within the securitization and apply legal judgment to the developing factual and legal record to estimate the liability for each securitization. We consider as factors within the analysis our own past monoline settlements in addition to publicly available industry monoline settlements. Our reserves with respect to the U.S. Bank Litigation, referenced below, are contained within the Active Insured Securitization reserve category. Further, to the extent we have litigation reserves with respect to indemnification risks from certain representation and warranty lawsuits brought by monoline bond insurers against third-party securitizations sponsors, where one of our subsidiaries provided some or all of the mortgage collateral within the securitization but is not a defendant in the litigation, such reserves are also contained within this category.

For the   $4 billion   original principal balance of mortgage loans in the Inactive Insured Securitizations category and the   $48 billion   original principal balance of mortgage loans in the Uninsured Securitizations category, we establish reserves based on an assessment of probable and estimable legal liability, if any, utilizing both our own experience and publicly available industry settlement information to estimate lifetime liability. In contrast with the bond insurers in the Insured Securitizations, investors in Uninsured Securitizations often face a number of legal and logistical hurdles before they can force a securitization trustee to pursue mortgage repurchases, including the need to coordinate with a certain percentage of investors holding the securities and to indemnify the trustee for any litigation it undertakes. Accordingly, we only reserve for such exposures when a trustee or investor with standing brings claims and it is probable we have incurred a loss. Some Uninsured Securitization investors from this category are currently suing investment banks and securitization sponsors under federal and/or state securities laws. Although we face some indirect indemnity risks from these litigations, we generally have not established reserves with respect to these indemnity risks because we do not consider them to be both probable and reasonably estimable liabilities. In addition, to the extent we have litigation reserves with respect to indemnification risks from certain representation and warranty lawsuits brought by parties who purchased loans from our subsidiaries and subsequently re-sold the loans into securitizations, such reserves are also contained within this category. 
  For the   $22 billion   original principal balance of mortgage loans sold to private investors as whole loans, we establish reserves based on open claims and historical repurchase rates. 
  The aggregate reserve for all   three   subsidiaries totaled   $632 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $610 million   as of   December 31, 2015  . We recorded a net provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses of   $21 million   (which includes a benefit of   $2 million   before taxes in continuing operations and a provision of   $23 million   before taxes in discontinued operations) in   the first nine months of 2016  . 
  As part of our business planning processes, we have considered various outcomes relating to the future representation and warranty liabilities of our subsidiaries that are possible but do not rise to the level of being both probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying an incremental accrual under applicable accounting standards. Our current best estimate of reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond our reserves as of   September 30, 2016   is approximately   $1.5 billion  , a decrease from our   $1.6 billion   estimate at   December 31, 2015  .   The decrease in this estimate was primarily driven by favorable rulings in representation and warranty-related litigation.   The estimate as of   September 30, 2016   covers all reasonably possible losses relating to representation and warranty claim activity, including those relating to the cases more specifically described below in Mortgage Repurchase Litigation. 
  In estimating reasonably possible future losses in excess of our current reserves, for Active Insured Securitizations, we assume loss rates on the high end of those observed in monoline settlements or court rulings. For our remaining GSE exposures, Uninsured Securitizations and whole loan exposures, our reasonably possible risk estimates assume lifetime loss rates and claims rates at the highest levels of our past experience and also consider the limited instances of observed settlements. We do not assume claim rates or loss rates for these risk categories will be as high as those assumed for the Active Insured Securitizations, however, based on industry precedent. Should the number of claims or the loss rates on these claims increase significantly, our estimate of reasonably possible risk would increase materially. We also assume that repurchase-related requests will be resolved at discounts reflecting the nature of the claims, the vintage of the underlying loans and evolving legal precedents.  
  Notwithstanding our ongoing attempts to estimate a reasonably possible amount of future losses beyond our current accrual levels based on current information, it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and our current estimate of the amount of reasonably possible losses. Our reserve and reasonably possible estimates involve considerable judgment and reflect that there is still significant uncertainty regarding numerous factors that may impact the ultimate loss levels, including, but not limited to: litigation outcomes; court rulings; governmental enforcement decisions; future repurchase and indemnification claim levels; securitization trustees pursuing mortgage repurchase litigation unilaterally or in coordination with investors; investors successfully pursuing repurchase litigation independently and without the involvement of the trustee as a party; ultimate repurchase and indemnification rates; future mortgage loan performance levels; actual recoveries on the collateral; and macroeconomic conditions (including unemployment levels and housing prices). In light of the significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability our subsidiaries may incur from these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period.

Litigation 
  In accordance with the current accounting standards for loss contingencies, we establish reserves for litigation related matters that arise from the ordinary course of our business activities when it is probable that a loss associated with a claim or proceeding has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. None of the amounts we currently have recorded individually or in the aggregate are considered to be material to our financial condition. Litigation claims and proceedings of all types are subject to many uncertain factors that generally cannot be predicted with assurance. Below we provide a description of potentially material legal proceedings and claims. 
  For some of the matters disclosed below, we are able to determine estimates of potential future outcomes that are not probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying either the establishment of a reserve or an incremental reserve build, but which are reasonably possible outcomes. For other disclosed matters, such an estimate is not possible at this time. For those matters below where an estimate is possible (excluding the reasonably possible future losses relating to the U.S. Bank Litigation and the Federal     Housing Finance Agency ( FHFA ) Litigation because reasonably possible losses with respect to those litigations are included within the reasonably possible representation and warranty liabilities discussed above) management currently estimates the reasonably possible future losses beyond our reserves as of   September 30, 2016   is approximately   $200 million  . Notwithstanding our attempt to estimate a reasonably possible range of loss beyond our current accrual levels for some litigation matters based on current information, it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and the range of reasonably possible losses disclosed here. Given the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters, especially those involving governmental agencies, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from these litigation matters and an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period. 
  Interchange Litigation 
  In 2005, a number of entities, each purporting to represent a class of retail merchants, filed antitrust lawsuits against MasterCard and Visa and several member banks, including our subsidiaries and us, alleging among other things, that the defendants conspired to fix the level of interchange fees. The complaints seek injunctive relief and civil monetary damages, which could be trebled. Separately, a number of large merchants have asserted similar claims against Visa and MasterCard only (together with the lawsuits described above,  Interchange Lawsuits ). In October 2005, the class and merchant Interchange Lawsuits were consolidated before the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for certain purposes, including discovery. In July 2012, the parties executed and filed with the court a Memorandum of Understanding agreeing to resolve the litigation on certain terms set forth in a settlement agreement attached to the Memorandum. The class settlement provides for, among other things, (i) payments by defendants to the class and individual plaintiffs totaling approximately   $6.6 billion  ; (ii) a distribution to the class merchants of an amount equal to 10 basis points of certain interchange transactions for a period of   eight months  ; and (iii) modifications to certain Visa and MasterCard rules regarding point of sale practices. In December 2013, the district court granted final approval of the proposed class settlement, which was appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in January 2014. On June 30, 2016, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the district court s certification of the class, reversed approval of the proposed class settlement, and remanded the litigation to the district court for further proceedings, ruling that some of the merchants that were part of the proposed class settlement were not adequately represented. Because the Second Circuit ruling remands the litigation to the district court for further proceedings, the ultimate outcome in this matter is uncertain. Several merchant plaintiffs also opted out of the class settlement before it was overturned, some of which have sued MasterCard, Visa and various member banks, including Capital One. The opt-out cases are consolidated before the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for certain purposes, including discovery. Visa and MasterCard have settled a number of individual opt-out cases, requiring non-material payments from all banks, including Capital One. Separate settlement and judgment sharing agreements between Capital One, MasterCard and Visa allocate the liabilities of any judgment or settlement arising from the Interchange Lawsuits and associated opt-out cases. Visa created a litigation escrow account following its IPO of stock in 2008, which funds any settlements for its member banks, and any settlements related to MasterCard allocated losses are reflected in Capital One s reserves.

Mortgage Repurchase Litigation 
  In February 2009, GreenPoint was named as a defendant in a lawsuit commenced in the New York County Supreme Court, by U.S. Bank, N. A., Syncora Guarantee Inc. and CIFG Assurance North America, Inc. ( U.S. Bank Litigation ). Plaintiffs allege, among other things, that GreenPoint breached certain representations and warranties in   two   contracts pursuant to which GreenPoint sold approximately   30,000   mortgage loans having an aggregate original principal balance of approximately $  1.8 billion   to a purchaser that ultimately transferred most of these mortgage loans to a securitization trust. Some of the securities issued by the trust were insured by Syncora and CIFG. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and an order compelling GreenPoint to repurchase the entire portfolio of   30,000   mortgage loans based on alleged breaches of representations and warranties relating to a limited sampling of loans in the portfolio, or, alternatively, the repurchase of specific mortgage loans to which the alleged breaches of representations and warranties relate. In March 2010, the court granted GreenPoint s motion to dismiss with respect to plaintiffs Syncora and CIFG but denied the motion with respect to U.S. Bank. GreenPoint subsequently answered the complaint with respect to U.S. Bank, denying the allegations, and filed a counterclaim against U.S. Bank alleging breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In February 2012, the court denied plaintiffs  motion for leave to file an amended complaint and dismissed Syncora and CIFG from the case. Syncora and CIFG appealed their dismissal to the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department ( First Department ), which affirmed the dismissal in April 2013. The New York Court of Appeals denied Syncora s and CIFG s motion for leave to appeal the First Department s decision in February 2014. Therefore, the case is now proceeding with U.S. Bank as the sole plaintiff. On May 20, 2015, Lehman Brothers Holding, Inc. ( LBHI ) filed an adversary proceeding in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York against U.S. Bank, Syncora and GreenPoint regarding bankruptcy proofs of claims filed by U.S. Bank and Syncora on the same securitization at issue in the U.S. Bank Litigation. The adversary proceeding filed by LBHI has been resolved and dismissed. 
  In May, June and July 2012, FHFA (acting as conservator for Freddie Mac) filed   three   summonses with notice in the New York state court against GreenPoint, on behalf of the trustees for   three   RMBS trusts backed by loans originated by GreenPoint with an aggregate original principal balance of   $3.4 billion  . In January 2013, the plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint in the name of the three trusts, acting by the respective trustees, alleging breaches of contractual representations and warranties regarding compliance with GreenPoint underwriting guidelines relating to certain loans ( FHFA Litigation ). Plaintiffs seek specific performance of the repurchase obligations with respect to the loans for which they have provided notice of alleged breaches as well as all other allegedly breaching loans, rescissory damages, indemnification, costs and interest. 
  As noted above in the section entitled Mortgage Representation and Warranty Liabilities, the Company s subsidiaries establish reserves with respect to representation and warranty litigation matters, where appropriate, within the Company s overall representation and warranty reserves. Please see above for more details. 
  Anti-Money Laundering  
  Capital One has received subpoenas and requests for testimony from the New York District Attorney s Office ( NYDA ) with respect to certain former check casher clients of the Commercial Banking business and Capital One s anti-money laundering ( AML ) program. In early 2015, we received similar requests from the U.S. Department of Justice ( DOJ ) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ( FinCEN ) of the U.S. Department of Treasury. Capital One is cooperating with all agencies involved in the investigation  .

Intellectual Ventures Corp., et al. 
  In June 2013, Intellectual Ventures I, LLC and Intellectual Ventures II, LLC (collectively  IV ) sued Capital One Financial Corp., Capital One Bank (USA), N.A. and Capital One, N.A. (collectively  Capital One ) for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. In the Complaint, IV alleged infringement of patents related to various business processes across the Capital One enterprise. IV simultaneously filed patent infringement actions against numerous other financial institutions on the same and other patents in several other federal courts. Capital One filed an answer and counterclaim alleging antitrust violations. In December 2013, the court dismissed Capital One s counterclaim and decided the parties  arguments on claim construction. IV agreed to dismiss   two   patents in suit, and following claim construction, asked for a stipulation of non-infringement for   one   patent with an opportunity to appeal the court s decision regarding claim construction. In April 2014, the court granted Capital One s motion for summary judgment and found that the   two   remaining patents were either unpatentable or indefinite. In May 2014, IV appealed to the Federal Circuit, which affirmed the district court s dismissal of all three remaining patents in July 2015.  
  In January 2014, IV filed a second suit against Capital One for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. In the complaint, IV again alleges infringement of patents related to various business practices across the Capital One enterprise. In March 2015, the court granted Capital One s motion for leave to add a counterclaim for antitrust violations. IV voluntarily dismissed   one   of the patents against Capital One and in September 2015, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Capital One on the remaining four patents and dismissed IV s claims. IV has appealed the dismissal of three of its claims to the Federal Circuit. 
  Other Pending and Threatened Litigation 
  In addition, we are commonly subject to various pending and threatened legal actions relating to the conduct of our normal business activities. In the opinion of management, the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out of all such other pending or threatened legal actions will not be material to our consolidated financial position or our results of operations.

  Item 4. Controls and Procedures     
  Overview 
  We are required under applicable laws and regulations to maintain controls and procedures, which include disclosure controls and procedures as well as internal control over financial reporting, as further described below. 
  (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our financial reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding our required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we must apply judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures. 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  As required by Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ), our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of   September 30, 2016  , the end of the period covered by this Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  , at a reasonable level of assurance, in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting information required to be disclosed within the time periods specified by the SEC rules and forms. 
  (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  We regularly review our disclosure controls and procedures and make changes intended to ensure the quality of our financial reporting. There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred in   the third quarter of 2016   that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
