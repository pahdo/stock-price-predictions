      Table of Contents           WorldNet, Inc. of Nevada    Notes to the (Unaudited) Financial Statements   September 30, 2016     NOTE 1   BASIS OF FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION     The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted in accordance with such rules and regulations. The information furnished in the interim condensed financial statements includes normal recurring adjustments and reflects all adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of such financial statements. Although management believes the disclosures and information presented are adequate to make the information not misleading, it is suggested that these interim condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the Company s audited financial statements and notes thereto included in its December 31, 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for year ending December 31, 2016.     NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN     The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has limited assets, has incurred losses since inception, has negative cash flows from operations, and has no revenue-generating activities. Its activities have been limited for the past several years and it is dependent upon financing to continue operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. It is management s plan to acquire or merge with other operating companies.      NOTE 3   RECENT PRONOUNCEMENT     On June 10, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued update ASU 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915). Amongst other things, the amendments in this update removed the definition of development stage entity from Topic 915, thereby removing the distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from US GAAP. In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information on the statements of income, cash flows and shareholders  equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity; (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2014 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, however entities are permitted to early adopt for any annual or interim reporting period for which the financial statements have yet to be issued. The Company has elected to early adopt these amendments and accordingly have not labeled the financial statements as those of a development stage entity and have not presented inception-to-date information on the respective financial statements.      NOTE 4   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS     The Company has evaluated subsequent events from the balance sheet date through the date the financial statements were issued and has determined that there are no such events that would have a material impact on the financial statements.                   7       
      Table of Contents           In this report references to  WorldNet,   the Company,   we,   us,  and  our  refer to WorldNet, Inc. of Nevada.       FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS      The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) encourages reporting companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand future prospects and make informed investment decisions. This report contains these types of statements. Words such as  may,   expect,   believe,   intend,   anticipate,   estimate,   project,  or  continue  or comparable terminology used in connection with any discussion of future operating results or financial performance identify forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. All forward-looking statements reflect our present expectation of future events and are subject to a number of important factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.                   8       
      Table of Contents            ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS         Executive Overview       We have not recorded revenues for the past two fiscal years. We are dependent upon financing to continue basic operations. Management intends to rely upon advances or loans from management, significant stockholders or third parties to meet our cash requirements, but we have not entered into written agreements guaranteeing funds and, therefore, no one is obligated to provide funds to us in the future. These factors raise doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Our plan is to combine with an operating company to generate revenue.      Our management has not had any recent discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a business combination with us. Any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks. In addition, any business combination or transaction will likely result in a significant issuance of shares and substantial dilution to present stockholders of the Company.      We anticipate that the selection of a business opportunity will be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of securities. Potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.     If we obtain a business opportunity, then it may be necessary to raise additional capital. We anticipate that we will sell our common stock to raise this additional capital. We expect that we would issue such stock pursuant to exemptions to the registration requirements provided by federal and state securities laws. The purchasers and manner of issuance will be determined according to our financial needs and the available exemptions to the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. We do not currently intend to make a public offering of our stock. We also note that if we issue more shares of our common stock, then our stockholders may experience dilution in the value per share of their common stock.        Liquidity and Capital Resources       We have not established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover our operating costs and we have relied primarily upon related and third parties to provide loans to fund operations and provide or pay for professional expenses. At September 30, 2016 our cash increased to $2,581 from $481 at December 31, 2015. Our total liabilities increased to $268,966 at September 30, 2016 from $243,419 at December 31, 2015. This increase for the 2016 nine month period primarily represents cash advances of $8,200, accrued interest of $12,047, along with accounts payable of $5,300 for consulting services and administrative and professional services and out-of-pocket costs provided to or paid on behalf of the Company by a shareholder.      We intend to obtain capital from management, significant stockholders or third parties to cover minimal operations; however, there is no assurance that additional funding will be available. Our ability to continue as a going concern during the long term is dependent upon our ability to find a suitable business opportunity and acquire or enter into a merger with such company. The type of business opportunity with which we acquire or merge will affect our profitability for the long term.      During the next 12 months we anticipate incurring additional costs related to the filing of Exchange Act reports. We believe we will be able to meet these costs through funds provided by management, significant stockholders or third parties. We may also rely on the issuance of our common stock in lieu of cash to convert debt or pay for expenses.                   9       
      Table of Contents            Results of Operations       We did not record revenues in 2016 or 2015. General and administrative expense decreased to $11,400 for the 2016 nine month period compared to $13,340 for the 2015 nine month period. General and administrative expense decreased to $2,900 for the 2016 third quarter compared to $3,100 for the 2015 third quarter. The decrease in general and administrative expense for the 2016 nine month period primarily reflects decreased costs for consulting services and fees relied upon for our operations.      Total other expense related to interest expense from notes payable increased to $12,047 for the 2016 nine month period compared to $9,922 for the 2015 nine month period and increased to $4,083 for the 2016 third quarter compared to $3,379 for the 2015 third quarter.      Our net loss increased to $23,447 for the 2016 nine month period compared to $23,262 for the 2015 nine month period, but our net loss increased to $6,983 for the 2016 third quarter compared to $6,479 for the 2015 third quarter. Management expects net losses to continue until we acquire or merge with a business opportunity.       Commitments and Obligations       At September 30, 2016 we recorded notes payable of $205,200 with accrued interest of $49,966. All of the notes payable are non-collateralized, carry interest at 8% and are due on demand. During the 2016 nine month period we borrowed $8,200 from a third party.      During the 2016 nine month period we recorded accounts payable of $5,300 representing administrative and professional services and out-of-pocket costs provided to or paid on behalf of the Company by a more than 5% shareholder, First Equity Holdings Corp.        Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements       We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors.       Critical Accounting Policies       We qualify as an  emerging growth company  under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the  JOBS Act ). As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, among other things, we will not be required to:                    Have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;                        Submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as  say-on-pay  and  say-on-frequency                         Obtain shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved; and                         Disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executives compensation to median employee compensation.                   In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.      We will remain an  emerging growth company  for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion; (ii) the date that we become a  large accelerated filer  as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed third fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.        ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       Not applicable to smaller reporting companies.       ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES         Disclosure Controls and Procedures       We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. This information is accumulated to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our President, who serves as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report and he determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective due to a control deficiency. During the period we did not have additional personnel to allow segregation of duties to ensure the completeness or accuracy of our information. Due to the size and operations of the Company we are unable to remediate this deficiency until we acquire or merge with another company.        Changes to Internal Control over Financial Reporting       Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and determined that there were no changes made in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
