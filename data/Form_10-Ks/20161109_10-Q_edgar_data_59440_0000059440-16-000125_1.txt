1  .  
    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
       
           (a) 
    Basis of Presentation  : 
       
  The condensed consolidated financial statements of Vector Group Ltd. (the  Company  or  Vector ) include the accounts of VGR Holding LLC ( VGR Holding ), Liggett Group LLC ( Liggett ), Vector Tobacco Inc. ( Vector Tobacco ), Liggett Vector Brands LLC ( Liggett Vector Brands ), Zoom E-Cigs LLC ( Zoom ), New Valley LLC ( New Valley ) and other less significant subsidiaries. New Valley includes the accounts of Douglas Elliman Realty, LLC ( Douglas Elliman ) and other less significant subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
  Liggett and Vector Tobacco are engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes in the United States. Zoom is engaged in the sale of electronic cigarettes in the United States. New Valley is engaged in the real estate business. 
  The unaudited, interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information and, in management's opinion, contain all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods presented. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The consolidated results of operations for interim periods should not be regarded as necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year. 
  Revisions to December 31, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet.    In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB") issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-03,  Interest-Imputation of Interest , which requires debt issuance costs to be reported in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the face amount of the note. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. This amendment must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company adopted the provisions of this ASU retrospectively in the first quarter of 2016, and adjusted all prior periods accordingly. The adoption of this ASU will simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs and reduce complexity without decreasing the usefulness of information provided to users of financial statements.

The cumulative impacts of the application of the new ASU are presented in the table below: 

Adoption of Equity Method.    The Company adopted the equity method of accounting for its investments in Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc. ( LTS ) and Castle Brands Inc. ( Castle ) in 2015 because the Company determined that it had significant influence due to the evolution of the relationships with each company. In accordance with ASC 323-35-33, the Company has adjusted its condensed consolidated financial statements, retrospectively, on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect since inception. 
  The cumulative impact of the retrospective application of the equity method of accounting for the two investments are presented in the table below:

(b) 
    Distributions and Dividends on Common Stock  : 
       
  The Company records distributions on its common stock as dividends in its condensed consolidated statement of stockholders' deficiency to the extent of retained earnings and accumulated paid-in capital. Any amounts exceeding retained earnings are recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital  to the extent paid-in-capital is available. The Company s stock dividends are recorded as stock splits and given retroactive effect to earnings per share for all periods presented. 
    
           (c) 
    Revenue Recognition  :  
       
  Tobacco and E-Cigarettes sales:    Revenues from sales are recognized upon the shipment of finished goods when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the sale price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. The Company provides an allowance for expected sales returns, net of any related inventory cost recoveries (e.g. federal excise taxes). Certain sales incentives, including promotional price discounts, are classified as reductions of net sales. The Company includes federal excise taxes on tobacco sales in revenues and cost of goods sold. Since the Company s primary line of business is tobacco, the Company s financial position and its results of operations and cash flows have been and could continue to be materially adversely affected by significant unit sales volume declines at the Company and industry levels, regulation, litigation and defense costs, increased tobacco costs or reductions in the selling price of cigarettes in the near term. 
  Real estate sales:    Revenue is recognized only when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, the transaction has been completed and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Real estate commissions earned by the Company s real estate brokerage businesses are recorded as revenue on a gross basis upon the closing of a real estate transaction as evidenced when the escrow or similar account is closed, the transaction documents have been recorded and funds are distributed to all appropriate parties. Commission expenses are recognized concurrently with related revenues.

Property management fees and rental commissions earned are recorded as revenue when the related services are performed and the earnings process is complete. 
    
           (d) 
    Earnings Per Share ( EPS )  :  
       
  Information concerning the Company's common stock has been adjusted to give retroactive effect to the   5%   stock dividend paid to Company stockholders on   September 29, 2016  . All per share amounts and references to share amounts have been updated to reflect the retrospective effect of the stock dividends.   
    
  Net income for purposes of determining basic and diluted EPS was as follows: 

Basic and diluted EPS were calculated using the following common shares: 

The following were outstanding during the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , but were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the effect was anti-dilutive.

(e) 
    Fair Value of Derivatives Embedded within Convertible Debt  : 
       
  The Company has estimated the fair value of the embedded derivatives based principally on the results of a valuation model. A  readily determinable fair value of the embedded derivatives is not available. The estimated fair value of the derivatives embedded within the convertible debt is based principally on the present value of future dividend payments expected to be received by the convertible debt holders over the term of the debt. The discount rate applied to the future cash flows is estimated based on a spread in the yield of the Company's debt when compared to risk-free securities with the same duration.  The valuation model assumes future dividend payments by the Company and utilizes interest rates and credit spreads for secured to unsecured debt, unsecured to subordinated debt and subordinated debt to preferred stock to determine the fair value of the derivatives embedded within the convertible debt. At   September 30, 2016  , the range of estimated fair values of the Company's embedded derivatives was between   $119,621   and   $121,299  . The Company recorded the fair value of its embedded derivatives at the approximate midpoint of the range at   $120,820   as of   September 30, 2016  . At   December 31, 2015  , the range of estimated fair values of the Company's embedded derivatives was between   $143,422   and   $144,660  . The Company recorded the fair value of its embedded derivatives at the midpoint of the range at   $144,042   as of   December 31, 2015  . The estimated fair value of the Company's embedded derivatives could change significantly based on future market conditions. (See Note   6  .)   
    
           (f) 
    Investment in Real Estate Ventures: 
       
  The Company's investment in real estate ventures are subject to evaluation under ASU No. 2015-02,  Consolidation  which requires all legal entities to be evaluated as either a voting interest entity or a Variable Interest Entities ( VIE ).  The guidance is effective for financial statements of public companies issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015.   The Company has followed the decision tree set forth in ASC 810-10-05-6 in analyzing each of its investments in real estate ventures. The Company examines specific criteria and uses judgment when determining if the real estate venture is a VIE and then if the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Factors considered in the qualification of a VIE include sufficient equity investment at risk, disproportionate voting rights and substantially all of the activities are conducted on behalf of an investor with disproportionately few voting rights, and characteristics of a controlling financial interest. 
  Accounting guidance requires the Company to perform the VIE primary-beneficiary assessment for entities determined to be VIEs. The Company is required to consolidate all VIEs in which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The guidance requires consolidation of VIEs that a reporting entity has a controlling financial interest. A controlling financial interest will have both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly affect the VIE's economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive residual returns of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. 
  The Company's maximum exposure to loss in its investments in unconsolidated VIEs is limited to its investment in the unconsolidated VIEs which is the carrying value. The Company's maximum exposure to loss in its investment in its consolidated VIEs is limited to its investment which is the carrying value of the investment net of the non-controlling interest. Creditors of the consolidated VIEs have no recourse to the general credit of the primary beneficiary.

The agreement extended the lease term from 2018 to 2032. The new agreements increase the Company s lease commitments by   $0   in 2016,   $1,164   in 2017,   $1,412   in 2018,   $3,733   in 2019,   $5,394   in 2020 and   $69,460   thereafter.

    New Accounting Pronouncements  : 
       
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17, Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control ( ASU 2016-17 ).  ASU 2016-17 modifies existing guidance with respect to how a decision maker that holds an indirect interest in a VIE through a common control party determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE as part of the analysis of whether the VIE would need to be consolidated. Under ASU 2016-17, a decision maker would need to consider only its proportionate indirect interest in the VIE held through a common control party. As a result of ASU 2016-17, in certain cases, previous consolidation conclusions may change. ASU 2016-17 is effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2017 with retrospective

application to January 1, 2016.  The Company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-17 will have on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2016,  the FASB issued  ASU  2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ( ASU 2016-15 ).  ASU 2016-15 is intended to reduce diversity in practice on how certain cash receipts and payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The standard provides guidance in a number of situations including, among others, settlement of zero-coupon bonds, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, and distributions received from equity method investees. ASU 2016-15 also provides guidance for classifying cash receipts and payments that have aspects of more than one class of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018.  Early adoption is permitted. The standard requires application using a retrospective transition method. The Company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-15 will have on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 modifies U.S. GAAP by requiring the following, among others: (1) all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies are to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit on the income statement (excess tax benefits are recognized regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period); (2) excess tax benefits are to be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows; (3) in the area of forfeitures, an entity can still follow the current U.S. GAAP practice of making an entity-wide accounting policy election to estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or may instead account for forfeitures when they occur; and (4) classification as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows of cash paid by an employer to the taxing authorities when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes. ASU 2016-09 is effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2017, including interim periods. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-09 will have on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) ( ASU 2016-08 ). ASU 2016-08 does not change the core principle of the guidance stated in ASU 2014-09, instead, the amendments in this ASU are intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations and whether an entity reports revenue on a gross or net basis. ASU 2016-08 will have the same effective date and transition requirements as the new revenue standard issued in ASU 2014-09. The Company is currently evaluating the method and impact the adoption of  ASU 2016-08 and ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07, Investments- Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting ( ASU 2016-07 ). ASU 2016-07 eliminates the requirement to apply the equity method of accounting retrospectively when a reporting entity obtains significant influence over a previously held investment. ASU 2016-07 will be effective for the Company s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2017 and subsequent interim periods. The adoption of ASU 2016-07 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-06,  Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force) ( ASU 2016-06 ).  ASU 2016-06 clarifies the requirement for assessing whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts. An entity performing the assessment under ASU 2016-06 is required to assess the embedded call (put) options solely in accordance with the four-step decision sequence. Consequently, when a call (put) option is contingently exercisable, an entity does not have to assess whether the event that triggers the ability to exercise a call (put) option is related to interest rates or credit risks. The amendments in ASU 2016-06 are effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2017, including interim periods. The Company is currently evaluating the method and impact the adoption of ASU 2016-06 will have on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases ( ASU 2016-02 ), which provides guidance for accounting for leases. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to classify leases as either finance or operating leases and to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term greater than 12 months regardless of the lease classification. The lease classification will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest rate method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. Accounting for lessors remains largely unchanged from current U.S. GAAP. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for the Company s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2019 and subsequent interim periods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( ASU 2016-01 ). ASU 2016-01 modifies how entities measure equity investments and present changes in the fair value of financial liabilities. Under the new guidance, entities will have to measure equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income unless the investments qualify for the new practicality exception. A practicality exception will apply to those equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value and do not qualify for the practical expedient to estimate fair value under ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements, and as such these investments may be measured at cost. ASU 2016-01 will be effective for the Company s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018 and subsequent interim periods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-01 will have on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In May 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-9, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), ( ASU 2014-9 ). ASU 2014-9 outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.

(a) Cost-Method Investments: 
    
  Long-term investments accounted at cost consisted of the following: 

The principal business of the investment partnerships is investing in investment securities and real estate. The estimated fair value of the investment partnerships was provided by the partnerships based on the indicated market values of the underlying assets or investment portfolio. The investments in these investment partnerships are illiquid and the ultimate realization of these investments is subject to the performance of the underlying partnership and its management by the general partners. In the future, the Company may invest in other investments, including limited partnerships, real estate investments, equity securities, debt securities, derivatives and certificates of deposit, depending on risk factors and potential rates of return. 
  If it is determined that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value exists in long-term investments, the Company records an impairment charge with respect to such investment in its consolidated statements of operations. The Company will continue to perform additional assessments to determine the impact, if any, on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. Thus, future impairment charges may occur. 
  The Company has accounted for these investments using the cost method of accounting because the investments did not meet the requirements for equity method accounting. 
   The Company received cash distributions of   $1,000   and   $543   from the Company's investments in long-term investments under the cost method for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

  The long-term investments are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at cost. The fair value determination disclosed above 
  would be classified as Level 3 under fair value hierarchy disclosed in Note   11   if such assets were recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. The fair value determinations disclosed above were based on company assumptions, and information obtained from the partnerships based on the indicated market values of the underlying assets of the investment portfolio.

  The Company has outstanding   $835,000   principal amount of its   7.75%   Senior Secured Notes due   2021   that are guaranteed subject to certain customary automatic release provisions  on a joint and several basis by all of the   100%   owned domestic subsidiaries of the Company that are engaged in the conduct of its tobacco businesses.  
  The indenture contains covenants that restrict the payment of dividends by the Company if the Company s consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( Consolidated EBITDA ), as defined in the indenture, for the most recently ended four full quarters is less than   $75,000  . The indenture also restricts the incurrence of debt if the Company s Leverage Ratio and its Secured Leverage Ratio, as defined in the indenture, exceed   3.0   and   1.5  , respectively. The Company s Leverage Ratio is defined in the indenture as the ratio of the Company s and the guaranteeing subsidiaries  total debt less the fair market value of the Company s cash, investments in marketable securities and long-term investments to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the indenture. The Company s Secured Leverage Ratio is defined in the indenture in the same manner as the Leverage Ratio, except that secured indebtedness is substituted for indebtedness. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , management believed that the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the indentures of the   7.75%   Senior Secured Notes due   2021  . 
  On May 9, 2016, the Company completed the sale of an additional   $235,000   principal amount of its   7.75%   Senior Secured Notes due 2021 for a price of   103.50%   in a private offering to qualified institutional investors in accordance with Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933 (the  Securities Act ). The Company received net proceeds of approximately   $236,900   after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, fees and offering expenses. The net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including for additional investments in real estate and in the Company's cigarette business.  The Company will amortize the deferred costs and debt premium related to the additional Senior Secured Notes over the estimated remaining life of the debt.   
  In August 2016, the Company completed an offer to exchange the   7.75%   Senior Secured Notes issued in May 2016 for an equal amount of newly issued   7.75%   Senior Secured Notes due 2021. The new   7.75%   Senior Secured Notes have substantially the same terms as the original notes, except that the new   7.75%   Senior Secured Notes have been registered under the Securities Act. 
    
  6.75% Variable Interest Senior Convertible Note due 2015 - Vector  : 
    
  On February 3, 2015, the holder of the   6.75%   Variable Interest Senior Convertible Note due 2015, converted the remaining   $25,000   principal balance of the   $50,000   Note into   2,455,877   of the Company's common shares. The debt conversion resulted in a reduction of debt and an increase to equity in the amount of   $25,000  .  
    
  Share Lending Agreement 
    
  In connection with the offering of its 2019 Convertible Notes in November 2012, the Company lent Jefferies   Company ( Jefferies ), the underwriter for the offering, shares of the Company s common stock under the Share Lending Agreement.   3,715,802   shares were outstanding as of   December 31, 2015  . Jefferies is entitled to offer and sell such shares and use the sale to facilitate the establishment of a hedge position by investors in the notes and will receive all proceeds from the common stock offerings and lending transactions under the Share Lending Agreement. The Company received a nominal lending fee of   $0.10   per share for each share of common stock that the Company lent pursuant to the Share Lending Agreement. 
  The Share Lending Agreement requires that the shares borrowed be returned upon the maturity of the related debt, January 2019, or earlier, including the redemption of the notes or the conversion of the notes to shares of common stock pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the notes. Borrowed shares are issued and outstanding for corporate law purposes and, accordingly, the holders of the borrowed shares will have all of the rights of a holder of the Company s outstanding shares. However, because the share borrower must return to the Company all borrowed shares (or identical shares), the borrowed shares are not considered outstanding for purposes of computing and reporting the Company s earnings per share in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Jefferies agreed to pay to the Company an amount equal to any dividends or other distributions that the Company pays on the borrowed shares. 
  The Company received a nominal fee for the loaned shares and determined the fair value of the Share Lending Agreement was   $3,204   at the date of issuance based on the present value of the future cash flows attributed to an estimated reduction in stated interest due to the presence of the Share Lending Agreement. The   $3,204   fair value was recognized as a debt financing charge and amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes. In September 2016,   2,135,923   shares were returned but no cash was

The fair value determinations disclosed above are classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy disclosed in Note   11   if such liabilities were recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheet at fair value. The estimated fair value of the Company's notes payable and long-term debt has been determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies including the evaluation of the Company's credit risk as described in the Company's Form 10-K. The Company used a derived price based upon quoted market prices and trade activity as of   September 30, 2016   to determine the fair value of its publicly-traded notes and debentures. The carrying value of the revolving credit facility and term loan is equal to the fair value. The fair value of the equipment loans and other obligations was determined by calculating the present value of the required future cash flows.

    CONTINGENCIES    
       
  Tobacco-Related Litigation  : 
    
  Overview.    Since 1954, Liggett and other United States cigarette manufacturers have been named as defendants in numerous direct, third-party and purported class actions predicated on the theory that cigarette manufacturers should be liable for damages alleged to have been caused by cigarette smoking or by exposure to secondary smoke from cigarettes. The cases have generally fallen into the following categories: (i) smoking and health cases alleging personal injury brought on behalf of individual plaintiffs ( Individual Actions  (ii) lawsuits by individuals requesting the benefit of the   Engle   ruling (   Engle   progeny cases  (iii) smoking and health cases primarily alleging personal injury or seeking court-supervised programs for ongoing medical monitoring, as well as cases alleging that use of the terms  lights  and/or  ultra lights  constitutes a deceptive and unfair trade practice, common law fraud or violation of federal law, purporting to be brought on behalf of a class of individual plaintiffs ( Class Actions  and (iv) health care cost recovery actions brought by various foreign and domestic governmental plaintiffs and non-governmental plaintiffs seeking reimbursement for health care expenditures allegedly caused by cigarette smoking and/or disgorgement of profits ( Health Care Cost Recovery Actions ).  The future financial impact of the risks and expenses of litigation are not quantifiable. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , Liggett incurred tobacco product liability legal expenses and costs totaling   $1,500   and   $5,355  , respectively.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , Liggett incurred tobacco product liability legal expenses and costs totaling   $7,378   and   $11,068  , respectively.  The tobacco product liability legal expenses and costs are included in the operating, selling, administrative and general expenses and litigation settlement and judgment expense line items in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.      
  Litigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases. With the commencement of new cases, the defense costs and the risks relating to the unpredictability of litigation increase.  Management reviews on a quarterly basis with counsel all pending litigation and evaluates the probability of a loss being incurred and  whether an estimate can be made of the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. An unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco-related litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation. Damages awarded in tobacco-related litigation can be significant. 
  Bonds.    Although Liggett has been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts are on appeal, there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases. This risk has been reduced given that a majority of states now limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all. To obtain stays on judgments pending current appeals of the   Putney  ,   Calloway  ,   Boatright   and   Ward   cases Liggett, as of    September 30, 2016  , had secured   $5,258   in bonds.   
  In June 2009, Florida amended its existing bond cap statute by adding a   $200,000   bond cap that applies to all   Engle   progeny cases in the aggregate and establishes individual bond caps for individual   Engle   progeny cases in amounts that vary depending on the number of judgments in effect at a given time.  The maximum amount of any such bond for an appeal in the Florida state courts will be no greater than   $5,000  .  In several cases, plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of the bond cap statute, but to date the courts have upheld the constitutionality of the statute. It is possible that the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome of such challenges. 
  Accounting Policy  .   The Company and its subsidiaries record provisions in their consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. At the present time, while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, except as disclosed in this Note   7  : (i) management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; or (ii) management is unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of any of the pending tobacco-related cases and, therefore, management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes, if any.  Legal defense costs are expensed as incurred.  
  Cautionary Statement About Engle Progeny Cases  .  Judgments have been entered against Liggett and other industry defendants in more than   100     Engle   progeny cases. A number of the judgments have been affirmed on appeal and satisfied by the defendants.  Many have been overturned on appeal.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   24     Engle   progeny cases where Liggett was a defendant at trial resulted in verdicts.   Fifteen   verdicts were returned in favor of the plaintiffs (although in   two   of these cases

(  Irimi   and   Cohen  ) the court granted defendants' motion for a new trial) and   nine   in favor of Liggett.  In   four   of the cases, punitive damages were awarded against Liggett (although in   Calloway  ,     both the punitive and compensatory damages award were reversed and the case was remanded to the trial court for a new trial).  In certain cases, the judgments were entered jointly and severally with other defendants and Liggett may face the risk that one or more co-defendants decline or otherwise fail to participate in the bonding required for an appeal or to pay their proportionate or jury-allocated share of a judgment.  As a result, under certain circumstances, Liggett may have to pay more than its proportionate share of any bonding or judgment related amounts. Several of the judgments against Liggett remain on appeal.  Except as discussed in this Note   7   regarding the cases where an adverse verdict against Liggett remains on appeal, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss from the remaining   Engle   progeny cases as there are currently multiple defendants in each case and, in most cases, discovery has not occurred or is limited. As a result, the Company lacks information about whether plaintiffs are in fact   Engle   class members (non-class members  claims are generally time-barred), the relevant smoking history, the nature of the alleged injury and the availability of various defenses, among other things. Further, plaintiffs typically do not specify their demand for damages.      
  Although Liggett has generally been successful in managing litigation, litigation is subject to uncertainty and significant challenges remain, including with respect to the remaining   Engle   progeny cases. There can be no assurances that Liggett s past litigation experience will be representative of future results. Judgments have been entered against Liggett in the past, in Individual Actions and   Engle   progeny cases, and several of those judgments were affirmed on appeal and satisfied by Liggett. It is possible that the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of any of the remaining smoking-related litigation. Liggett believes, and has been so advised by counsel, that it has valid defenses to the litigation pending against it, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts.  All such cases are and will continue to be vigorously defended, however, Liggett has entered into settlement discussions in individual cases or groups of cases where Liggett has determined it was in its best interest to do so, and it may continue to do so in the future, including with respect to the remaining   Engle   progeny cases.  In October 2013, Liggett announced a settlement of the claims of over   4,900     Engle   progeny plaintiffs (see   Engle   Progeny Settlement below).  As of   September 30, 2016  , Liggett (and in certain cases the Company) had, on an individual basis, settled   175     Engle   progeny cases for approximately   $6,000   in the aggregate.  There were   no   settlements in the third quarter of 2016. 
  Individual Actions 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   33   Individual Actions pending against Liggett and, in certain cases, the Company, where one or more individual plaintiffs allege injury resulting from cigarette smoking, addiction to cigarette smoking or exposure to secondary smoke and seek compensatory and, in some cases, punitive damages. These cases do not include the remaining   Engle   progeny cases or the individual cases pending in West Virginia state court as part of a consolidated action.

The plaintiffs  allegations of liability in cases in which individuals seek recovery for injuries allegedly caused by cigarette smoking are based on various theories of recovery, including negligence, gross negligence, breach of special duty, strict liability, fraud, concealment, misrepresentation, design defect, failure to warn, breach of express and implied warranties, conspiracy, aiding and abetting, concert of action, unjust enrichment, common law public nuisance, property damage, invasion of privacy, mental anguish, emotional distress, disability, shock, indemnity, violations of deceptive trade practice laws, the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ( RICO ), state RICO statutes and antitrust statutes. In many of these cases, in addition to compensatory damages, plaintiffs also seek other forms of relief including treble/multiple damages, medical monitoring, disgorgement of profits and punitive damages. Although alleged damages often are not determinable from a complaint, and the law governing the pleading and calculation of damages varies from state to state and jurisdiction to jurisdiction, compensatory

and punitive damages have been specifically pleaded in a number of cases, sometimes in amounts ranging into the hundreds of millions and even billions of dollars.  
  Defenses raised in Individual Actions include lack of proximate cause, assumption of the risk, comparative fault and/or contributory negligence, lack of design defect, statute of limitations, equitable defenses such as  unclean hands  and lack of benefit, failure to state a claim and federal preemption. 
    Engle Progeny Cases 
  Engle Case.    In May 1994,   Engle   was filed against Liggett and others in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The class consisted of all Florida residents who, by November 21, 1996,  have suffered, presently suffer or have died from diseases and medical conditions caused by their addiction to cigarette smoking.  In July 1999, after the conclusion of Phase I of the trial, the jury returned a verdict against Liggett and other cigarette manufacturers on certain issues determined by the trial court to be  common  to the causes of action of the plaintiff class. The jury made several findings adverse to the defendants including that defendants  conduct  rose to a level that would permit a potential award or entitlement to punitive damages.  Phase II of the trial was a causation and damages trial for   three   of the class plaintiffs and a punitive damages trial on a class-wide basis before the same jury that returned the verdict in Phase I. In April 2000, the jury awarded compensatory damages of $  12,704   to the   three   class plaintiffs, to be reduced in proportion to the respective plaintiff s fault. In July 2000, the jury awarded approximately   $145,000,000   in punitive damages, including   $790,000   against Liggett. 
  In May 2003, Florida s Third District Court of Appeal reversed the trial court and remanded the case with instructions to decertify the class. The judgment in favor of   one   of the   three   class plaintiffs, in the amount of   $5,831  , was overturned as time barred and the court found that Liggett was not liable to the other   two   class plaintiffs. 
  In July 2006, the Florida Supreme Court affirmed the decision vacating the punitive damages award and held that the class should be decertified prospectively, but determined that the following Phase I findings are entitled to res judicata effect in   Engle   progeny cases: (i) that smoking causes lung cancer, among other diseases; (ii) that nicotine in cigarettes is addictive; (iii) that defendants placed cigarettes on the market that were defective and unreasonably dangerous; (iv) that defendants concealed material information knowing that the information was false or misleading or failed to disclose a material fact concerning the health effects or addictive nature of smoking; (v) that defendants agreed to conceal or omit information regarding the health effects of cigarettes or their addictive nature with the intention that smokers would rely on the information to their detriment; (vi) that defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that were defective; and (vii) that defendants were negligent. The Florida Supreme Court decision also allowed former class members to proceed to trial on individual liability issues (using the above findings) and compensatory and punitive damages issues.  In December 2006, the Florida Supreme Court added the finding that defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that, at the time of sale or supply, did not conform to the representations made by defendants. In October 2007, the United States Supreme Court denied defendants  petition for writ of certiorari.     
  Pursuant to the Florida Supreme Court s July 2006 ruling in   Engle  , which decertified the class on a prospective basis and affirmed the appellate court s reversal of the punitive damages award, former class members had until January 2008 in which to file individual lawsuits. As a result, Liggett and the Company, and other cigarette manufacturers, were sued in thousands of   Engle   progeny cases in both federal and state courts in Florida. Although the Company was not named as a defendant in the   Engle   case, it was named as a defendant in substantially all of the   Engle   progeny cases where Liggett was named as a defendant. 
  Engle Progeny Settlement.    In October 2013, the Company entered into a settlement with approximately   4,900     Engle   progeny plaintiffs and their counsel. Pursuant to the terms of the settlement, Liggett agreed to pay a total of approximately   $110,000  , with approximately   $61,600   paid in a lump sum and the balance to be paid in installments over   14 years  , starting in February 2015. In exchange, the claims of over   4,900   plaintiffs, including  the claims of all plaintiffs with cases pending in federal court, were dismissed with prejudice against the Company and Liggett. Due to the settlement, in 2013, the Company recorded a charge of   $86,213   of which approximately   $25,000   is related to certain payments discounted to their present value using an   11%   annual discount rate. The installment payments total approximately   $48,000   on an undiscounted basis. The Company s future payments will be approximately   $3,400   per annum through 2028, with a cost of living increase beginning in 2021.      
  Notwithstanding the comprehensive nature of the   Engle   Progeny Settlement, approximately   240   plaintiffs  claims remain pending in state court. Therefore, the Company and Liggett may still be subject to periodic adverse judgments which could have a material adverse affect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In February 2015, the jury answered certain questions on the verdict form, but were deadlocked as to others.  The jury returned a verdict of $559 in economic damages.

Through   September 30, 2016  , Liggett paid $  39,773  , including interest and attorneys' fees, to satisfy the judgments in the following   Engle   progeny cases:   Lukacs  ,   Campbell  ,   Douglas  ,   Clay,     Tullo, Ward, Rizzuto, Lambert   and   Buchanan  .  
  The Company s current potential range of loss, related to awarded damages only, is between   $0   and   $3,308   in the aggregate, plus interest and attorneys' fees, however, this is only an estimate and final damages in any case might increase as a result of pending appeals.  In determining the range of loss, the Company considers potential settlements as well as future appellate relief. Except as disclosed elsewhere in this Note   7  , the Company is unable to determine a range of loss related to the remaining   Engle   progeny cases.  As cases proceed through the appellate process, the Company will consider accruals on a case-by-case basis if an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. 
  Appeals of Engle Progeny Judgments.    In December 2010, in the   Martin   case, a state court case against R.J. Reynolds, the First District Court of Appeal held that the trial court correctly construed the Florida Supreme Court s 2006 decision in   Engle   in instructing the jury on the preclusive effect of the Phase I   Engle   findings. In July 2011, the Florida Supreme Court declined to review the First District Court of Appeal s decision. In March 2012, the United States Supreme Court declined to review the   Martin   case, along with the   Campbell   case and   two   other   Engle   progeny cases. The   Martin   decision has led to additional adverse rulings by other state appellate courts. 
  In   Jimmie Lee Brown  , a state court case against R.J. Reynolds, the trial court tried the case in two phases. In the first phase, the jury determined that the smoker was addicted to cigarettes that contained nicotine and that his addiction was a legal cause of his death, thereby establishing he was an   Engle   class member. In the second phase, the jury determined whether the plaintiff established legal cause and damages with regard to each of the underlying claims. The jury found in favor of plaintiff in both phases. In September 2011, the Fourth District Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment entered in plaintiff s favor and approved the trial court s procedure of bifurcating the trial. The Fourth District Court of Appeal agreed with   Martin   that individual post-  Engle   plaintiffs need not prove conduct elements as part of their burden of proof, but disagreed with   Martin   to the extent that the First District Court of Appeal only required a finding that the smoker was a class member to establish legal causation as to addiction and the underlying claims. The Fourth District Court of Appeal held that in addition to establishing class membership,   Engle   progeny plaintiffs must also establish legal causation and damages as to each claim asserted.  In so finding, the Fourth District Court of Appeal s decision in   Jimmie Lee Brown   is in conflict with   Martin  .   
  In   Rey,   a state court case, the trial court entered final summary judgment on all claims in favor of the Company, Liggett and Lorillard based on what has been referred to in the   Engle   progeny litigation as the  Liggett Rule.  The Liggett Rule stands for the proposition that a manufacturer cannot have liability to a smoker under any asserted claim if the smoker did not use a product manufactured by that particular defendant. The Liggett Rule is based on the entry of final judgment in favor of Liggett/Brooke Group in   Engle   on all of the claims asserted against them by class representatives Mary Farnan and Angie Della Vecchia, even though the Florida Supreme Court upheld, as res judicata, the generic finding that Liggett/Brooke Group engaged in a conspiracy to commit fraud by concealment. In September 2011, the Third District Court of Appeal affirmed in part and reversed in part holding that the defendants were entitled to summary judgment on all claims asserted against them other than the claim for civil conspiracy. Defendants  further appellate efforts were unsuccessful. 
  In   Douglas  , a state court case, the Second District Court of Appeal issued a decision affirming the judgment of the trial court in favor of the plaintiff and upholding the use of the   Engle   jury findings, but certified to the Florida Supreme Court the question of whether granting   res judicata   effect to the   Engle   jury findings violates defendants  federal due process rights. In March 2013, the Florida Supreme Court affirmed the use of   Engle   jury findings and determined that there is no violation of the

defendants  due process rights. This was the first time the Florida Supreme Court addressed the merits of an   Engle   progeny case. In October 2013, the United States Supreme Court declined to review the decision and Liggett satisfied the judgment. To date, the United States Supreme Court has declined to review any   Engle   progeny decisions. 
  In   Hess  , a state court case, in April 2015, the Florida Supreme Court held that   Engle   defendants cannot raise a statute of repose defense to claims for concealment or conspiracy.  
  In April 2015, in   Graham  , a federal case,     the Eleventh Circuit held that federal law impliedly preempts use of the   res judicata     Engle   findings to establish claims for strict liability or negligence.  In January 2016, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals granted the plaintiff s motion for rehearing   en banc   and vacated the panel's decision.  Defendants filed a motion requesting that the court enter a briefing order directing the parties to address both implied preemption and whether the application of the   Engle   findings violates federal due process.  Oral argument on rehearing occurred in June 2016 and a decision is pending. 
  In January 2016, in   Marotta  , the Fourth District Court of Appeal disagreed with the   Graham   panel's decision.  The Florida Supreme Court has accepted jurisdiction in   Marrota.    Oral argument occurred on November 1, 2016.  
  In March 2016, the Florida Supreme Court held that   Engle   progeny plaintiffs may seek punitive damages on their claims for non-intentional torts, rejecting the argument that plaintiffs are precluded from doing so because the   Engle   class did not pursue such damages on those claims. 
    
  Maryland Cases 
       
  Liggett is currently a defendant in   13   multi-defendant personal injury cases in Maryland that allege claims arising from asbestos and tobacco exposure.  The tobacco defendants, including Liggett, moved (or are in the process of moving) to dismiss the cases.  In the past, motions to dismiss have generally been successful, typically resulting in the dismissal without prejudice of the tobacco company defendants, including Liggett.  Recently, however, a Maryland intermediate appellate court ruled, in   Stidham, et al. v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, et al.,   that dismissal of tobacco company defendants may not be appropriate where the asserted injury is based on both asbestos and tobacco exposure ("synergy cases").  On May 9, 2016, the Court of Appeals for Maryland (Maryland's highest court) heard oral argument on the appeal of the intermediate appellate court's decision.  On July 5, 2016, the Court of Appeals ruled that joinder of tobacco and asbestos cases may be possible in certain circumstances, but plaintiffs must demonstrate at the trial court level how such cases may be joined while providing appropriate safeguards to prevent embarrassment, delay, expense or prejudice to defendants and "the extent to which, if at all, the special procedures applicable to asbestos cases should extend to tobacco companies."  Other than providing guidance, the Court of Appeals remanded these issues to be determined at the trial court level.  It is possible that Liggett and other tobacco company defendants will not be dismissed from pending synergy cases, and may be named as defendants in asbestos-related personal injury actions in Maryland going forward, including approximately   20   additional synergy cases currently pending in Maryland state court. 
    
  Liggett Only Cases     
    
  There are currently   four   cases pending where Liggett is the only remaining defendant.    Three   of these cases are Individual Actions and   one   is an   Engle   progeny case.  In November 2015, in   Hausrath   (NY state court), the court entered a case management order providing discovery deadlines.  There has been no further activity in the other   three   cases.  It is possible that cases where Liggett is the only defendant could increase as a result of the remaining   Engle   progeny cases.  
    
  Class Actions 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   three   actions were pending for which either a class had been certified or plaintiffs were seeking class certification where Liggett is a named defendant. Other cigarette manufacturers are also named in these actions.  
  Plaintiffs  allegations of liability in class action cases are based on various theories of recovery, including negligence, gross negligence, strict liability, fraud, misrepresentation, design defect, failure to warn, nuisance, breach of express and implied warranties, breach of special duty, conspiracy, concert of action, violation of deceptive trade practice laws and consumer protection statutes and claims under the federal and state anti-racketeering statutes. Plaintiffs in the class actions seek various forms of relief, including compensatory and punitive damages, treble/multiple damages and other statutory damages and penalties, creation of medical monitoring and smoking cessation funds, disgorgement of profits, and injunctive and equitable relief.

Defenses raised in these cases include, among others, lack of proximate cause, individual issues predominate, assumption of the risk, comparative fault and/or contributory negligence, statute of limitations and federal preemption.  
  In November 1997, in   Young v. American Tobacco Co.,   a purported personal injury class action was commenced on behalf of plaintiff and all similarly situated residents in Louisiana who, though not themselves cigarette smokers, allege they were exposed to secondhand smoke from cigarettes that were manufactured by the defendants, including Liggett, and suffered injury as a result of that exposure. The plaintiffs seek to recover an unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages. No class certification hearing has been held. The case has been stayed for a number of years, with the stay renewed every few years.  The last stay was entered on March 16, 2016 and stays the case, including all discovery, pending the completion of the smoking cessation program ordered by the court in   Scott v. The American Tobacco Co  . 
    In February 1998, in   Parsons v. AC   S Inc.  , a purported class action was commenced on behalf of all West Virginia residents who allegedly have personal injury claims arising from exposure to cigarette smoke and asbestos fibers. The complaint seeks to recover   $1,000   in compensatory and punitive damages individually and unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for the class. The case is stayed due to the December 2000 bankruptcy of   three   of the defendants.   
  Although not technically a class action, in   In Re: Tobacco Litigation (Personal Injury Cases)  , a West Virginia state court  consolidated approximately   750   individual smoker actions that were pending prior to 2001 for trial of certain "common" issues.  Liggett was severed from trial of the consolidated action.  After   two   mistrials, in May 2013, the jury rejected all but   one   of the plaintiffs' claims, finding in favor of plaintiffs on the claim that ventilated filter cigarettes between 1964 and July 1, 1969 should have included instructions on how to use them. The issue of damages was reserved for further proceedings.  The court entered judgment in October  2013, dismissing all claims except the ventilated filter claim.  The judgment was affirmed on appeal and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.  In April 2015, the plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court which subsequently declined review.  In July 2015, the trial court ruled on the scope of the ventilated filter claim and determined that only   30   plaintiffs have potentially viable claims against the non-Liggett defendants, which may be pursued in a second phase of the trial.  The court intends to try the claims of these plaintiffs in   six   consolidated trials, each with   five   plaintiffs.  The trial court set the first date for the consolidated trials for January 9, 2017.  With respect to Liggett, the trial court requested that Liggett and plaintiffs brief whether any claims against Liggett survive given the outcome of the first phase of the trial. On May 23, 2016  ,   the trial court ruled that the case may proceed against Liggett.  Liggett requested that the trial court certify the matter to the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals for review, but the trial court refused.       It is estimated that Liggett could be a defendant in approximately   75   individual cases. 
  In addition to the cases described above, numerous class actions remain certified against other cigarette manufacturers including cases alleging, among other things, that use of the terms  lights  and  ultra lights  constitutes unfair and deceptive trade practices.  Adverse decisions in these cases could have a material adverse affect on Liggett s sales volume, operating income and cash flows. 
  Health Care Cost Recovery Actions 
    As of   September 30, 2016  ,   one   Health Care Cost Recovery Action was pending against Liggett,   Crow Creek Sioux Tribe v. American Tobacco Company  , a South Dakota case filed in 1997, where the plaintiff seeks to recover damages based on various theories of recovery as a result of alleged sales of tobacco products to minors. The case is inactive. Other cigarette manufacturers are also named as defendants.    
  The claims asserted in health care cost recovery actions vary, but can include the equitable claim of indemnity, common law claims of negligence, strict liability, breach of express and implied warranty, breach of special duty, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, conspiracy, public nuisance, claims under state and federal statutes governing consumer fraud, antitrust, deceptive trade practices and false advertising, and claims under RICO. Although no specific damage amounts are typically pleaded, it is possible that requested damages might be in the billions of dollars. In these cases, plaintiffs typically assert equitable claims that the tobacco industry was  unjustly enriched  by their payment of health care costs allegedly attributable to smoking and seek reimbursement of those costs. Relief sought by some, but not all, plaintiffs include punitive damages, multiple damages and other statutory damages and penalties, injunctions prohibiting alleged marketing and sales to minors, disclosure of research, disgorgement of profits, funding of anti-smoking programs, additional disclosure of nicotine yields, and payment of attorney and expert witness fees. 
  Department of Justice Lawsuit     
  In September 1999, the United States government commenced litigation against Liggett and other cigarette manufacturers

in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The action sought to recover an unspecified amount of health care costs paid and to be paid by the federal government for lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema and other smoking-related illnesses allegedly caused by the fraudulent and tortious conduct of defendants, to restrain defendants and co-conspirators from engaging in alleged fraud and other allegedly unlawful conduct in the future, and to compel defendants to disgorge the proceeds of their unlawful conduct. Claims were asserted under RICO.  
  In August 2006, the trial court entered a Final Judgment against each of the cigarette manufacturing defendants, except Liggett.  In May 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia affirmed most of the district court s decision. The United States Supreme Court denied review. As a result, the cigarette manufacturing defendants, other than Liggett, are now subject to the trial court s Final Judgment which ordered the following relief: (i) an injunction against  committing any act of racketeering  relating to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion, health consequences or sale of cigarettes in the United States; (ii) an injunction against participating directly or indirectly in the management or control of the Council for Tobacco Research, the Tobacco Institute, or the Center for Indoor Air Research, or any successor or affiliated entities of each; (iii) an injunction against  making, or causing to be made in any way, any material false, misleading, or deceptive statement or representation or engaging in any public relations or marketing endeavor that is disseminated to the United States  public and that misrepresents or suppresses information concerning cigarettes  (iv) an injunction against conveying any express or implied health message through use of descriptors on cigarette packaging or in cigarette advertising or promotional material, including  lights,   ultra lights,  and  low tar,  which the court found could cause consumers to believe one cigarette brand is less hazardous than another brand; (v) the issuance of  corrective statements  in various media regarding the adverse health effects of smoking, the addictiveness of smoking and nicotine, the lack of any significant health benefit from smoking  low tar  or  lights  cigarettes, defendants  manipulation of cigarette design to ensure optimum nicotine delivery and the adverse health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; (vi) the disclosure of defendants  public document websites and the production of all documents produced to the government or produced in any future court or administrative action concerning smoking and health; (vii) the disclosure of disaggregated marketing data to the government in the same form and on the same schedules as defendants now follow in disclosing such data to the Federal Trade Commission for a period of   ten years  ; (viii) certain restrictions on the sale or transfer by defendants of any cigarette brands, brand names, formulas or cigarette business within the United States; and (ix) payment of the government s costs in bringing the action. In June 2014, the court approved a consent agreement between the defendants and the Department of Justice regarding the  corrective statements  to be issued by the defendants.  In May 2015, the court of appeals issued an opinion on the legality of the "corrective statements," affirming them in part and reversing them in part.  The implementation of the  corrective statements  is uncertain as proceedings are ongoing. 
  It is unclear what impact, if any, the Final Judgment will have on the cigarette industry as a whole. To the extent that the Final Judgment leads to a decline in industry-wide shipments of cigarettes in the United States or otherwise results in restrictions that adversely affect the industry, Liggett s sales volume, operating income and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. 
  Upcoming Trials 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   17   Engle   progeny cases and   one   Individual Action scheduled for trial through September 30, 2017, where Liggett (and/or the Company) is a named defendant.  Trial dates are, however, subject to change.   
  MSA and Other State Settlement Agreements 
  In March 1996, March 1997 and March 1998, Liggett entered into settlements of smoking-related litigation with   45   states and territories. The settlements released Liggett from all smoking-related claims made by those states and territories, including claims for health care cost reimbursement and claims concerning sales of cigarettes to minors. 
  In November 1998, Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds and two other companies (the  Original Participating Manufacturers  or  OPMs ) and Liggett and Vector Tobacco (together with any other tobacco product manufacturer that becomes a signatory, the  Subsequent Participating Manufacturers  or  SPMs ) (the OPMs and SPMs are hereinafter referred to jointly as the  Participating Manufacturers ) entered into the Master Settlement Agreement (the  MSA ) with   46   states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the United States Virgin Islands, American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands (collectively, the  Settling States ) to settle the asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and certain other claims of the Settling States. The MSA received final judicial approval in each Settling State.

As a result of the MSA, the Settling States released Liggett and Vector Tobacco from: 
             
    all claims of the Settling States and their respective political subdivisions and other recipients of state health care funds, relating to: (i) past conduct arising out of the use, sale, distribution, manufacture, development, advertising and marketing of tobacco products; (ii) the health effects of, the exposure to, or research, statements or warnings about, tobacco products; and  
                
    all monetary claims of the Settling States and their respective subdivisions and other recipients of state health care funds relating to future conduct arising out of the use of, or exposure to, tobacco products that have been manufactured in the ordinary course of business. 
     The MSA restricts tobacco product advertising and marketing within the Settling States and otherwise restricts the activities of Participating Manufacturers. Among other things, the MSA prohibits the targeting of youth in the advertising, promotion or marketing of tobacco products; bans the use of cartoon characters in all tobacco advertising and promotion; limits each Participating Manufacturer to   one   tobacco brand name sponsorship during any   12  -month period; bans all outdoor advertising, with certain limited exceptions; prohibits payments for tobacco product placement in various media; bans gift offers based on the purchase of tobacco products without sufficient proof that the intended recipient is an adult; prohibits Participating Manufacturers from licensing third parties to advertise tobacco brand names in any manner prohibited under the MSA; and prohibits Participating Manufacturers from using as a tobacco product brand name any nationally recognized non-tobacco brand or trade name or the names of sports teams, entertainment groups or individual celebrities. 
  The MSA also requires Participating Manufacturers to affirm corporate principles to comply with the MSA and to reduce underage use of tobacco products and imposes restrictions on lobbying activities conducted on behalf of Participating Manufacturers. In addition, the MSA provides for the appointment of an independent auditor to calculate and determine the amounts of payments owed pursuant to the MSA. 
  Under the payment provisions of the MSA, the Participating Manufacturers are required to make annual payments of $  9,000,000   (subject to applicable adjustments, offsets and reductions including a "Non-Participating Manufacturers Adjustment" or "NPM Adjustment"). These annual payments are allocated based on unit volume of domestic cigarette shipments. The payment obligations under the MSA are the several, and not joint, obligation of each Participating Manufacturer and are not the responsibility of any parent or affiliate of a Participating Manufacturer.   
  Liggett has   no   payment obligations under the MSA except to the extent its market share exceeds a market share exemption of approximately   1.65%   of total cigarettes sold in the United States. Vector Tobacco has   no   payment obligations under the MSA except to the extent its market share exceeds a market share exemption of approximately   0.28%   of total cigarettes sold in the United States. Liggett and Vector Tobacco s domestic shipments accounted for   3.3%   of the total cigarettes sold in the United States in 2015. If Liggett s or Vector Tobacco s market share exceeds their respective market share exemption in a given year, then on April 15 of the following year, Liggett and/or Vector Tobacco, as the case may be, must pay on each excess unit an amount equal (on a per-unit basis) to that due from the OPMs for that year.  On December 30, 2015, Liggett and Vector Tobacco pre-paid   $100,000   of their approximate     $115,000   2015 MSA obligation, the balance of which was paid in April 2016.  
  Certain MSA Disputes 
  NPM Adjustment.    Liggett and Vector Tobacco contend that they are entitled to an NPM Adjustment for each year from 2003 - 2015.  The NPM Adjustment is a potential adjustment to annual MSA payments, available when the Participating Manufacturers suffer a market share loss to NPMs for a particular year and an economic consulting firm selected pursuant to the MSA determines that the MSA was a  significant factor contributing to  that loss.  A Settling State that has  diligently enforced  its qualifying escrow statute in the year in question may be able to avoid its allocable share of the NPM Adjustment.  For 2003 - 2015, Liggett and Vector Tobacco, as applicable, disputed that they owed the Settling States the NPM Adjustments as calculated by the Independent Auditor. As permitted by the MSA, Liggett and Vector Tobacco either paid subject to dispute, withheld payment or paid into a disputed payment account, the amounts associated with these NPM Adjustments. 
  The two requirements for application of the NPM Adjustment, a market share loss and a finding or agreement that the MSA was a significant factor in that loss, have been satisfied, and the Participating Manufacturers are engaged in disputes with certain of the Settling States over whether they diligently enforced their respective escrow statutes in each of the years from 2003 - 2014.  After several years  of litigation over whether the MSA s arbitration clause required a multistate arbitration of the NPM Adjustment dispute,   48   of   49   state courts ultimately compelled the states to participate in a single, multistate arbitration of the 2003 NPM Adjustment.  Notwithstanding, many states continued to refuse to arbitrate and agreed to do so only after the Participating Manufacturers agreed to a   20%   reduction in their 2003 NPM Adjustment claims.

The arbitration for the 2003 NPM Adjustment began in June 2010.  During the proceedings, the Participating Manufacturers decided not to contest the diligent enforcement of   16   states, with a combined allocable share of approximately   14%  .   
  While the 2003 arbitration was underway, the Participating Manufacturers entered into a term sheet with   22   states settling the NPM Adjustment for 2003 - 2012 and agreed to terms to address the NPM Adjustment with respect to those states for future years. The parties have been working towards converting the term sheet into a final settlement agreement.  
  The Participating Manufacturers continued to contest the diligence of   15   states relating to the 2003 NPM Adjustment.  In September 2013, the panel found that   six   of those states did not diligently enforce their MSA escrow statutes in 2003.  
    Two   of the states found non-diligent, Kentucky and Indiana, agreed to settle the dispute and enter into the term sheet described above.  The remaining   four   non-diligent states pursued motions in their respective state courts seeking to vacate or reduce the amount of the arbitration award. The Pennsylvania and Maryland courts refused to vacate the award but reduced the recovery by approximately   50%  .  In October 2016, the United States Supreme Court denied the Participating Manufacturers' petitions for certiorari.  The remaining   two   challenges to the 2003 arbitration award, in Missouri and New Mexico, remain pending in state court.  In Missouri, the appellate court reversed the trial court, which had reduced the arbitration award, and reinstated the full award. The Missouri Supreme Court granted a discretionary appeal of that decision.  Oral argument is set for November 8, 2016.  On September 27, 2013, the New Mexico trial court refused to vacate the award but reduced the recovery. Notice of appeal from that decision was due by October 27, 2016.      
  In October 2015, substantially all of the Participating Manufacturers settled the NPM Adjustment dispute with the state of New York for 2004 - 2014 and agreed to a mechanism for potential future credits against the Participating Manufacturers' MSA payments for 2015 forward.  
  As a result of the settlements and arbitration award described above, Liggett and Vector Tobacco reduced cost of sales in the aggregate by   $22,356   for years 2013 - 2015.  Liggett and Vector Tobacco may be entitled to further adjustments for 2015 forward.  The remaining NPM Adjustment accrual of approximately   $20,000   at   September 30, 2016   relates to the disputed amounts Liggett withheld from the non-settling states for 2004 - 2010, which may be subject to payment, with interest, if Liggett loses the disputes for those years.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there remains approximately   $28,600   in the disputed payments account relating to Liggett's 2011 - 2015 NPM Adjustment disputes with the non-settling states. 
       Disputes over the NPM Adjustments for 2004-2014 remain to be arbitrated with the states that have not joined the settlement.   The dispute over the NPM Adjustment for 2015 remains to be arbitrated with all the states.   
  The arbitration for the 2004 NPM Adjustment dispute has commenced.  Courts in   two   states, Pennsylvania and Maryland, rejected arguments that those states  claims of diligent enforcement should be addressed by a separate state-specific panel and they are participating in the multistate arbitration.  New Mexico has refused to participate, and a motion to compel is pending.  The Missouri court of appeals ruled that Missouri was entitled to a state-specific arbitration, and that issue is pending in the Missouri Supreme Court, with oral argument set for November 8, 2016.   Discovery is underway in the 2004 NPM Adjustment proceeding and evidentiary hearings are possible in 2017. 
     Gross      v.      Net      Calculations.    In October 2004, the independent auditor notified all Participating Manufacturers that their payment obligations under the MSA, dating from the agreement s execution in late 1998, had been recalculated using  net  units, rather than  gross  units (which had been used since 1999). Liggett objected to this retroactive change and disputed the change in methodology. 
  In December 2012, the parties arbitrated the dispute. In February 2013, the arbitrators ruled that the independent auditor was precluded from recalculating Liggett s grandfathered market share ( GFMS ) exemption. The arbitrators further ruled that, for purposes of calculating Liggett s payment obligations, Liggett s market share, calculated on a net basis, should be increased by a factor of   1.25%  . Liggett filed a motion seeking correction of the part of the arbitrators  decision that would require the   1.25%   increase in Liggett s market share. The states opposed Liggett s motion.  
  In October 2014, the panel issued a Corrected Final Award that eliminated the   1.25%   adjustment increase. The panel further determined that the independent auditor shall compute Liggett s market share for all years after 2000 on a  net  basis, but adjust that computation to approximate  gross  market share by using actual returned product data for each year.  In July 2015, the independent auditor issued calculations, purportedly based on the Corrected Final Award, which indicated that Liggett owed approximately   $16,000   for years 2001 - 2013. In June 2016, the independent auditor issued revised calculations indicating that Liggett owed approximately   $8,100   for years 2001 - 2013. In September 2016, Liggett paid   $8,100   and reduced cost of sales by   $370   but continued to dispute certain aspects of the independent auditor's calculation.

Other State Settlements.    The MSA replaced Liggett s prior settlements with all states and territories except for Florida, Mississippi, Texas and Minnesota. Each of these   four   states, prior to the effective date of the MSA, negotiated and executed settlement agreements with each of the other major tobacco companies, separate from those settlements reached previously with Liggett. Except as described below, Liggett s agreements with these states remain in full force and effect. These states  settlement agreements with Liggett contained most favored nation provisions which could reduce Liggett s payment obligations based on subsequent settlements or resolutions by those states with certain other tobacco companies. Beginning in 1999, Liggett determined that, based on settlements or resolutions with United States Tobacco Company, Liggett s payment obligations to those   four   states were eliminated. With respect to all non-economic obligations under the previous settlements, Liggett believes it is entitled to the most favorable provisions as between the MSA and each state s respective settlement with the other major tobacco companies. Therefore, Liggett s non-economic obligations to all states and territories are now defined by the MSA.  
  In 2003, as a result of a dispute with Minnesota regarding its settlement agreement, Liggett agreed to pay   $100   a year in any year cigarettes manufactured by Liggett are sold in that state. Further, the Attorneys General for Florida, Mississippi and Texas advised Liggett that they believed Liggett had failed to make payments under the respective settlement agreements with those states. In 2010, Liggett settled with Florida and agreed to pay   $1,200   and to make further annual payments of   $250   for a period of   21   years, starting in March 2011, with the payments from year   12   forward being subject to an inflation adjustment. These payments are in lieu of any other payments allegedly due to Florida.  
  On January 12, 2016, the Attorney General for Mississippi filed a motion in state court in Jackson County, Mississippi (Chancery Division) to enforce the March 1996 settlement agreement alleging that Liggett owes Mississippi at least   $26,000   (including interest) plus attorneys' fees and punitive damages.  Discovery is underway.   
  Liggett may be required to make additional payments to Texas and Mississippi which could adversely affect the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Cautionary Statement     
  Management is not able to reasonably predict the outcome of the litigation pending or threatened against Liggett or the Company. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties. Liggett has been found liable in multiple   Engle   progeny cases and Individual Actions, several of which were affirmed on appeal and satisfied by Liggett. It is possible that other cases could be decided unfavorably against Liggett and that Liggett will be unsuccessful on appeal. Liggett may attempt to settle particular cases if it believes it is in its best interest to do so.   
  Management cannot predict the cash requirements related to any future defense costs, settlements or judgments, including cash required to bond any appeals, and there is a risk that those requirements will not be able to be met. An unfavorable outcome of a pending smoking-related case could encourage the commencement of additional litigation. Except as discussed in this Note   7  , management is unable to estimate the loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the cases pending against Liggett or the costs of defending such cases and as a result has not provided any amounts in its consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes.  
  The tobacco industry is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations regarding the marketing, sale, taxation and use of tobacco products imposed by local, state and federal governments. There have been a number of restrictive regulatory actions, adverse legislative and political decisions and other unfavorable developments concerning cigarette smoking and the tobacco industry. These developments may negatively affect the perception of potential triers of fact with respect to the tobacco industry, possibly to the detriment of certain pending litigation, and may prompt the commencement of additional litigation or legislation. 
  It is possible that the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome in any of the smoking-related litigation.  
  The activity in the Company's accruals for the MSA and tobacco litigation for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were as follows:

The activity in the Company's accruals for the MSA and tobacco litigation for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   were as follows: 

Other Matters  : 
  Liggett s and Vector Tobacco s management are unaware of any material environmental conditions affecting their existing facilities. Liggett s and Vector Tobacco s management believe that current operations are conducted in material compliance with all environmental laws and regulations and other laws and regulations governing cigarette manufacturers. Compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has not had a material affect on the capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position of Liggett or Vector Tobacco.  
  Liggett Vector Brands entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of the Convenience Distribution Association to support a program to permit certain tobacco distributors to secure, on reasonable terms, tax stamp bonds required by state and local governments for the distribution of cigarettes. Under the agreement, Liggett Vector Brands has agreed to pay a portion of losses incurred by the surety under the bond program, with a maximum loss exposure of   $500  .  The Company believes the fair value of Liggett Vector Brands  obligation under the agreement was immaterial at   September 30, 2016  .

In addition to the foregoing, Douglas Elliman Realty, LLC and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous proceedings, lawsuits and claims in connection with their ordinary business activities.  Many of these matters are covered by insurance. 
    
  Liggett was contacted in October 2015, by one of its software vendors, who suggested that Liggett needed to purchase additional software licenses from it.  Liggett believes that its use of the vendor's software is in compliance with the licenses  previously purchased by Liggett.  In January 2016, the software vendor requested to audit Liggett s use of the relevant software.   Liggett has provided details of its use of the software and is continuing to cooperate with requests for information.  
  Management is of the opinion that the liabilities, if any, resulting from other proceedings, lawsuits and claims pending against the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries,  unrelated to tobacco product liability, should not materially affect the Company s condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The fair value of the Level 2 certificates of deposit is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate is the rate offered by the financial institution. The fair value of investment securities available for sale included in Level 1 are based on quoted market prices from various stock exchanges. The Level 2 investment securities available for sale are based on quoted market prices of securities that are thinly traded.  
  The fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt was derived using a valuation model. These derivatives have been classified as Level 3. The valuation model assumes future dividend payments by the Company and utilizes interest rates and credit spreads based upon the implied credit spread of the   5.50%   Convertible Notes due 2020 to determine the fair value of the derivatives embedded within the convertible debt. The changes in fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt are presented on the consolidated statements of operations.   
  The value of the embedded derivatives is contingent on changes in implied interest rates of the convertible debt, the Company's stock price, stock volatility as well as projections of future cash and stock dividends over the term of the debt. The interest rate component of the value of the embedded derivative is computed by calculating an equivalent non-convertible, unsecured and subordinated borrowing cost. This rate is determined by calculating the implied rate on the Company's 2020 Convertible Notes when removing the embedded option value within the convertible security. This rate is based upon market observable inputs and influenced by the Company's stock price, convertible bond trading price, risk free interest rates and stock volatility.  
  The unobservable inputs related to the valuations of the Level 3 assets and liabilities were as follows at   September 30, 2016  :

ITEM 2.        MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION        AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    
    
  (  Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts  ) 

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) is designed to provide a reader of Vector Group Ltd. s financial statements with a narrative from our management's perspective. Our MD A is divided into the following sections: 
     Overview and Recent Developments 
     Results of Operations 
     Summary of Real Estate Investments 
     Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Please read this discussion along with our MD A and audited financial statements as of and for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and Notes thereto, included in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and related Notes as of and for the quarterly period   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Overview 
  We are a holding company and are engaged principally in: 
             
    the manufacture and sale of cigarettes in the United States through our Liggett Group LLC and Vector Tobacco Inc. subsidiaries,  
                
    the sale of electronic cigarettes in the United States through our Zoom E-Cigs LLC subsidiary, and 
                
    the real estate business through our New Valley LLC subsidiary, which is seeking to acquire or invest in additional real estate properties or projects. New Valley owns 70.59% of Douglas Elliman, which operates the largest residential brokerage company in the New York metropolitan area. 
     Zoom entered the United States e-cigarette market in limited retail distribution outlets in  2013. Zoom s operations are included in our  E-Cigarettes  reporting segment. We have seen significant changes in the e-cigarette market since entering the market with declines in the sales of disposable and rechargeable e-cigarettes while open-system vapor products that feature refillable tanks and use low-cost flavored liquids have demonstrated mixed results. Additionally, we believe uncertainties exist related to the impact of recent regulation of e-cigarettes, including open-system vapor products. Given the current market situation, our primary focus on e-cigarettes is to pursue opportunities if they occur. 

Recent Developments 
    
  Investments in Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services ( LTS ) and Castle Brands Inc. ( Castle ).   We adopted the equity method of accounting for our investments in LTS and Castle in 2015 because we determined that we had significant influence due to the evolution of the relationships with each company. We have adjusted our condensed consolidated financial statements, retrospectively, as if the equity method had been in effect since inception.  On October 26, 2016, we exercised warrants to purchase 1,000,000 LTS shares at $1.68 per share.  Our ownership percentage increased to 7.8%. 
    
    Issuance of Senior Secured Notes due 2021  .  On May 9, 2016, we completed the sale of an additional $235,000 principal amount of our 7.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2021 for a price of 103.50% in a private offering to qualified institutional investors in accordance with Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933 (the  Securities Act ). We received net proceeds of approximately $236,900. The net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including for additional investments in real estate and in our tobacco business. In August 2016, we completed an offer to exchange the   7.75%   senior secured notes issued in May 2016 for an equal amount of newly issued   7.75%   senior secured notes due 2021. The new   7.75%   senior secured notes have substantially the same terms as the original notes, except that the new   7.75%   senior secured notes have been registered under the Securities Act.

Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
  Revenues  .    Total revenues were   $459,104   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $449,934   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   $9,170   (  2.0%  )   increase   in revenues was due to a   $9,994     increase   in Tobacco revenues offset by a   $627     decline   in Real Estate revenues primarily related to Douglas Elliman's brokerage revenues and a   $197     decline   in E-Cigarettes revenues.   
  Cost of sales  .    Total cost of sales were   $303,442   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $295,917   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   $7,525   (  2.5%  )   increase   in cost of sales was due to an   $11,925     increase   in Tobacco cost of sales primarily related to an increased sales volume and the   $5,715   of income from MSA settlements realized in the third quarter. This was offset by a   $3,989     decline   in Real Estate cost of sales primarily related to a   decline   of real estate commission expense at Douglas Elliman as well as a   $411     decline   in E-Cigarettes cost of sales. The calculation of our benefit from the MSA is an estimate based upon taxable unit shipments of cigarettes in the U.S. As of   September 30, 2016  , we estimated taxable shipments in the U.S. will decline by 3.5% in 2016. Our annual MSA expense changes by approximately $1,800 for each percentage change in the estimated shipment volumes in the U.S. market. 
  Expenses  .    Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses were   $86,298   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $79,352   for the same period last year. The   $6,946   (  8.8%  )   increase   in operating, selling and administrative expenses was due to an   $6,745     increase   in Real Estate operating, selling, general and administrative expenses primarily at Douglas Elliman and a   $1,945     increase   in Corporate and Other expense primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense, executive pension expense and increased professional fees. This was offset by a   $1,767     decline   in E-Cigarettes operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. 
  Operating income  .    Operating income was   $69,364   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $69,367   for the same period last year. Tobacco operating income   increased   by   $3,344  , E-Cigarettes operating losses   declined   by   $1,981   and this was offset by a   $3,383     decline   in Real Estate operating income and   an increase   of   $1,945   in Corporate and Other expenses.  
  Other income (expenses)  .    Other   expenses were     $30,341   and   $39,563   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , other   expenses   primarily consisted of interest expense of   $37,365  , equity in losses from investments of   $1,526   and impairment of investment securities available for sale of   $54  . This was offset by income of   $6,112   from changes in fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt, other income of   $1,328  , equity in earnings from real estate ventures of   $1,022  , and gain on sale of investment securities available for sale of   $142  . For the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , other   expenses   primarily consisted of interest expense of $32,898, impairment of investment securities available for sale of $12,211, equity in losses from investments of $1,103, equity in losses from real estate ventures of $916, and a loss on sale of investment securities available for sale of $821. This was offset by income of $7,044 from changes in fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt and other income of $1,342.  
  Income before provision for income taxes  .    Income before income taxes was   $39,023   and   $29,804   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Income tax expense  .    Income tax expense was   $13,316   and   $13,694   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Our provision for income taxes in interim periods is based on an estimated annual effective income tax rate derived, in part, from estimated annual income before provision for income taxes in accordance with guidance on accounting for income taxes on interim periods. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , our income tax expense was   decreased   by   $1,149   due primarily to a change in the estimated annual effective income tax rate. 
  Tobacco.

The change primarily related to higher payments of tobacco litigation settlements and judgments and income taxes in the 2016 period, as well as increases in the payments of prior year promotional and excise tax liabilities in the tobacco segment in the 2016.  These were offset by an increase of operating income. 
  Cash   used in   investing activities was   $2,721   and   $62,082   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

  Our investment philosophy is to maximize return on investments using a reasonable expectation for return. For example, we expect our investment returns to exceed the comparable return on cash or short-term U.S. Treasury Bills when investing in equity and debt securities and more than our weighted average cost of capital when investing in non-consolidated real estate businesses and capital expenditures. 
  Cash   provided by   financing activities was   $86,784   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to cash   used in   financing activities of   $157,954   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . In the first   nine   months of   2016  , cash provided by financing activities was from proceeds of debt issuance of   $243,620  , proceeds from net   borrowings   of debt under the revolver of   $10,182  , tax benefit of options exercised of   $412  , proceeds from the exercise of Vector options of   $398   and contributions from non-controlling interest of   $248  . This was offset by cash used for the dividends and distributions on common stock of   $147,270  , repayments of debt of   $4,698  , distributions to non-controlling interest of   $9,508   and payment of deferred financing costs of   $6,600  . In the first   nine   months of   2015  , cash was used for dividends and distributions on common stock of $139,430, net repayments of debt under the revolver of $15,964, repayment of debt of $4,968, payment of deferred financing costs of $624 and distributions to non-controlling interest of $564. This was offset by proceeds from issuance of debt of $1,519, proceeds from the exercise of Vector options of $1,321 and the tax benefit of options exercised of $756. 
  In recent years, we have taken advantage of historically low interest rates and lowered our weighted average cost of capital by issuing debt at lower interest rates than our historical borrowing levels and on May 9, 2016, we issued $235,000 of our 7.75% Senior Secured Notes for a price of 103.5%. We will continue to evaluate current market conditions related to our capital structure. For example, based on quoted market prices, our 7.75% Senior Secured Notes were yielding approximately   6.0%   on a  yield to worst  basis, or approximately   5.1%   more than the comparable U.S. Treasury Bond at   September 30, 2016  . The Company is presently able to redeem such bonds at price of 105.813% and the redemption price declines to 103.875% on February 15, 2017, 101.938% on February 15, 2018 and 100% on February 15, 2019. There can be no assurance that we would be able to continue to issue debt at a lower interest rate than our historical borrowing levels in the future and, in the event we pursue any capital markets activities, our ability to complete any offering would be subject to market conditions. 
  Liggett     Credit Facility and Liggett Term Loan Under Credit Facility.    As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $16,664   was outstanding under the revolving and term loan portions of the credit facility.

  Vector.   The indenture of our 7.75% senior secured notes due 2021 contains covenants that restrict the payment of dividends if our consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( Consolidated EBITDA ), as defined in the indenture, for the most recently ended four full quarters is less than $75,000. The indenture also restricts the incurrence of debt if our Leverage Ratio and our Secured Leverage Ratio, as defined in the indenture, exceed 3.0 and 1.5, respectively. Our Leverage  
  
    62 

Ratio is defined in the indenture as the ratio of our guaranteeing subsidiaries  total debt less the fair market value of our cash, investments in marketable securities and long-term investments to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the indenture. Our Secured Leverage Ratio is defined in the indenture in the same manner as the Leverage Ratio, except that secured indebtedness is substituted for indebtedness. The following table summarizes the requirements of financial covenants and the results of the calculation, as defined by the indenture. 

We and our subsidiaries have significant indebtedness and debt service obligations. At   September 30, 2016  , we and our subsidiaries had total outstanding indebtedness of   $1,346,191  , of which   $230,000   of our 7.5% convertible notes mature in 2019,   $258,750   of our 5.5% variable interest senior convertible notes mature in 2020, and   $835,000   of our 7.75% senior secured notes mature in 2021. In addition, subject to the terms of any future agreements, we and our subsidiaries will be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future. There is a risk that we will not be able to generate sufficient funds to repay our debt. If we cannot service our fixed charges, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
  We believe that our cigarette and real estate operations are positive cash-flow-generating units and will continue to be able to sustain their operations without any significant liquidity concerns.   
  In order to meet the above liquidity requirements as well as other anticipated liquidity needs in the normal course of business, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately   $445,900  , investment securities available for sale of approximately   $175,700  , long-term investments with an estimated value of approximately   $58,300   and availability under Liggett's credit facility of approximately   $40,200   at   September 30, 2016  . Management currently anticipates that these amounts, as well as expected cash flows from our operations, management fees and other payments from subsidiaries should be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs over the next 12 months. We may acquire or seek to acquire additional operating businesses through merger, purchase of assets, stock acquisition or other means, or to make other investments, which may limit our liquidity otherwise available.   
  On a quarterly basis, we evaluate our investments to determine whether an impairment has occurred. If so, we also make a determination if such impairment is considered temporary or other-than-temporary. We believe that the assessment of temporary or other-than-temporary impairment is facts and circumstances driven. However, among the matters that are considered in making such a determination are the period of time the investment has remained below its cost or carrying value, the likelihood of recovery given the reason for the decrease in market value and our original expected holding period of the investment. 

Market Risk 
    
  We are exposed to market risks principally from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices. We seek to minimize these risks through our regular operating and financing activities and our long-term investment strategy.  Our market risk management procedures cover all market risk sensitive financial instruments.   
  As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $16,700   of our outstanding debt at face value had variable interest rates determined by various interest rate indices, which increases the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our variable rate borrowings, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no interest rate caps or swaps. Based on a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates (1%), our annual interest expense could increase or decrease by approximately   $167  . 
  In addition, as of   September 30, 2016  ,   $298,118   (  $488,750   principal amount) of outstanding debt had a variable interest rate determined by the amount of the dividends on our common stock. The difference between the stated value of the debt and carrying value is due principally to certain embedded derivatives, which were separately valued and recorded upon issuance, and debt issuance costs. Changes to the estimated fair value of these embedded derivatives are reflected within our statements of operations as  Changes in fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt.  The value of the embedded derivative is contingent on changes in interest rates of debt instruments maturing over the duration of the convertible debt as well as projections of future cash and stock dividends over the term of the debt and changes in the closing stock price at the end of each quarterly period. Based on a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates (1%), our annual  Changes in fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt  could increase or decrease by approximately   $1,703   with approximately   $639   resulting from the embedded derivative associated with the 7.5% variable interest senior convertible notes, and the remaining   $1,064   resulting  
  
    63 

from the embedded derivative associated with our 5.5% variable interest senior convertible debentures due 2020. An increase in our quarterly dividend rate by $0.10 per share would increase interest expense by approximately   $10,400   per year. 
  We have estimated the fair market value of the embedded derivatives based principally on the results of a valuation model. The value of the embedded derivatives is contingent on changes in interest rates of debt instruments maturing over the duration of the convertible debt, our stock price as well as projections of future cash and stock dividends over the term of the debt. The interest rate component of the value of the embedded derivative is computed by calculating an equivalent non-convertible, unsecured and subordinated borrowing cost. This rate is determined by calculating the implied rate on our 7.5% Convertible Notes when removing the embedded option value within the convertible security. This rate is based upon market observable inputs and influenced by our stock price, convertible bond trading price, risk-free interest rates and stock volatility. The range of estimated fair market values of our embedded derivatives was between   $121,299   and   $119,621  . We recorded the fair market value of our embedded derivatives at the approximate midpoint of the range at   $120,820   as of   September 30, 2016  . The estimated fair market value of our embedded derivatives could change significantly based on future market conditions.  
    
  We and New Valley also hold long-term investments in various investment partnerships. These investments are illiquid, and their ultimate realization is subject to the performance of the underlying entities.

Legislation and Regulation 
    
  There are no material changes other than those set forth below from the Legislation and Regulation section set forth in Item 7,  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . Please refer to that section and the information below for disclosures regarding the critical accounting policies related to our business. 
  On May 5, 2016, the United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) issued a final  deeming  regulation that extends the agency s authority under the Tobacco Control Act to other tobacco products not currently regulated by the agency, such as e-cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco and hookah. With respect to these newly-regulated tobacco products, the deeming regulation, among other things: 
     establishes a minimum age of 18 years to purchase the products; 
     establishes identification restrictions to prevent underage sales of the products; 
     requires specific health warnings on product packages and advertisements;  
     requires registration with FDA and reporting of product and ingredient listings; 
     prohibits distribution of free samples of the products; 
             
    prohibits the sale of modified risk tobacco products (including those described as  light,   low,  or  mild ) unless authorized by FDA; 
        prohibits vending machine sales (unless in an adult-only facility); and 
             
    requires FDA review to market new tobacco products introduced after the proposed grandfathered date of February 15, 2007.  
          
  Under the new  deeming  rule, manufacturers of the newly-regulated products, including e-cigarettes, will be subject to the same Tobacco Control Act provisions and relevant regulatory requirements that already apply to cigarettes.  As of August 8, 2016, domestic manufacturers must register and list the tobacco products with FDA and obtain premarket market authorization for any product introduced after this date. For products introduced between February 15, 2007 and August 8, 2016, the premarket authorization requirements are subject to certain staggered compliance periods. Requests for exemption from the substantial equivalence requirement must be submitted by August 8, 2017. Substantial equivalence reports must be submitted by February 8, 2018. Premarket tobacco product applications must be submitted by August 8, 2018. Unless FDA issues an order denying or refusing to accept an application, FDA will not take enforcement action against the product for one year after the application deadline. However, at the end of that period, even if FDA has not completed its review, the product will be subject to enforcement action unless FDA determines that  substantial progress  is being made towards completion and decides to defer enforcement for a reasonable time period. FDA has not set deadlines for its own review.

ITEM 3.        QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

ITEM 4.        CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
       
  The Company has established disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation under the supervision of and with the participation of the Company s management, including the CEO and CFO, as of   September 30, 2016  , of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described in Part II, Item 9A of the 2015 Form 10-K. Management has concluded that the material weaknesses that were present at   December 31, 2015   continued to exist as of   September 30, 2016  , as discussed below. 
  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
  These material weaknesses did not result in any material misstatements to the financial statements in any accounting periods ending prior to January 1, 2016 or for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . However, these material weaknesses could result in misstatement of the aforementioned account balances or disclosures that would result in material misstatements to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 
  Status of Remediation 
  The Company identified five material weaknesses related to its Douglas Elliman subsidiary as of December 31, 2014 and two material weaknesses related to its Douglas Elliman subsidiary as of December 31, 2015.  Beginning in 2015, at the direction of the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors, as well as the Company s CEO and CFO, the Company has made and continues to make substantial progress in remediating these material weakness including: 
             
    In June 2015, Douglas Elliman employed a new Chief Financial Officer, who is a licensed Certified Public Accountant ( CPA ) with more than 30 years of experience in the financial departments of publicly-traded companies. In addition, in 2015, Douglas Elliman also added a Director of Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 Compliance, a corporate controller, who is licensed as a CPA and previously served as a senior manager at a Big Four accounting firm, two regional controllers who are both licensed as CPAs, and two accounting managers who are both licensed as CPAs. 
                
    In August 2015, Douglas Elliman employed a new Chief Technology Officer ( CTO ) who was previously a technology executive with a large U.S. financial institution. Douglas Elliman s new CTO oversees, among other things, security of the accuracy and completeness of the Company s financial reporting. 
                
    During 2015, Douglas Elliman improved its documentation of internal controls into a more robust format that has been designed to detect errors that could lead to material misstatements in the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
                
    During 2015, the Company redesigned and implemented a series of newly-created internal controls related to previously improper internal controls related to segregation of duties by accounting and finance personnel at Douglas Elliman. 
     The result of these efforts led to the remediation of the following material weaknesses as of December 31, 2015: 
           (i) 
    Douglas Elliman s previous failure to monitor controls in certain areas relating to the period-end financial reporting process,  
              (ii) 
    Douglas Elliman s previous failure to maintain effective controls over period-end financial reporting processes, including controls over the preparation, analysis and review of certain significant account reconciliations required to assess the appropriateness of account balances at period-end, as well as controls over the preparation and review of the interim and annual financial statements; and, 
              (iii) 
    Douglas Elliman s previous ineffective controls over the processing and recording of recurring and non-recurring journal entries. 

66 

Further, with the enhancements and focus described above, the Company is vigorously continuing its remediation efforts in 2016 related to the following material weaknesses: 
           (i) 
    Certain controls at Douglas Elliman related to segregation of duties with accounting and finance personnel were designed, but not operating, properly at December 31, 2015; and,  
              (ii) 
    Douglas Elliman did not maintain effective controls over access to its information technology system for finance and accounting ( IT System ). Specifically, root level access to Douglas Elliman s IT System was shared with the third party software provider that allowed unrestricted and unmonitored access to the application and it database. Further, the Company did not have an effective change management process to reasonably assure that changes to the IT System were properly documented, tracked, reviewed, tested and approved. 
     The Company s management, Audit Committee and Board of Directors are committed to maintaining a strong and sustainable internal control environment and believe that these remediation efforts represent significant improvements in the Company s control environment as well as its internal controls over the financial reporting of Douglas Elliman. Nonetheless, the Company continues to address the two remaining material weaknesses and evaluate the effectiveness of its new internal controls to confirm that a sustainable, controlled process is fully in place. In 2016, the Company has continued to introduce processes to help ensure that Douglas Elliman s financial reporting is complete and accurate. Further, the identified material weaknesses in internal controls will not be considered fully addressed until the internal controls over these areas have been in operation for a sufficient period of time for management to conclude that the material weaknesses have been fully remediated. Management continues to work on implementing and testing the new controls in order to make this final determination. 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  The Company s Board of Directors and its management, including the CEO and CFO, evaluated the changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   and concluded there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.

    Post-Trial Engle Progeny Cases. 
       
  Boatright,     et al.     v. R.J. Reynolds,     et al.  , Case No. 53-2011-CA-000158-000-WH, Circuit Court of the 10   th    Judicial Circuit, Polk County (case filed 01/12/11).  This was a personal injury action filed by a smoker and his spouse that proceeded to jury trial in October 2014.  At the close of plaintiff s case, the court granted directed verdict to Liggett on all claims other than the claim for conspiracy to conceal.  In November 2014, the jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiffs and awarded compensatory damages in the amount of $15,000,000.  The jury apportioned fault as follows:  Plaintiff - 15%, Philip Morris - 85%.  While the jury determined that Liggett s participation in an agreement to conceal was a legal cause of injury to plaintiffs, the court refused to allow the jury to consider apportioning fault to Liggett.  The jury assessed punitive damages against Philip Morris for $19,700,000 and Liggett for $300,000.  Post-trial motions were denied.  In January 2015, a joint and several judgment was entered against the defendants for $12,750,000 for the compensatory damages and $300,000 in punitive damages was awarded against Liggett.  The defendants appealed to the Second District Court of Appeal.  In March 2015, plaintiffs' motion for attorneys' fees was denied by the court.  Plaintiffs appealed that ruling. Oral argument occurred on October 18, 2016.  A decision is pending. 
    
  Calloway v. R.J. Reynolds,     et al.  , Case No. 08-21770, Circuit Court of the 17   th    Judicial Circuit, Broward County (case filed 05/15/08). This was a wrongful death action that proceeded to jury trial in April 2012.  In May 2012, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff and awarded compensatory damages in the amount of $20,500,000, which the court subsequently reduced to $16,100,000.  The jury apportioned fault as follows: Decedent - 20.5%, R.J. Reynolds - 27%, Philip Morris - 25%, Lorillard - 18% and Liggett - 9.5% ($1,529,500).   In August 2012, the trial court entered a joint and several judgment for compensatory damages in that amount.  In addition, the judgment awarded plaintiff $7,600,000 in punitive damages against Liggett. In September 2016, the Fourth District Court of Appeal reversed the judgment in its entirety and remanded the case for a new trial.  Plaintiff filed a notice to invoke the discretionary jurisdiction of the Florida Supreme Court.  Jurisdictional briefing is underway.

This was a personal injury action that proceeded to jury trial in February 2015. At trial, the court directed verdict in Liggett s favor on all of plaintiff s claims other than conspiracy. The jury returned a partial verdict in favor of plaintiff and against Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, Lorillard and Liggett  and awarded economic damages in the amount of $559,172.  In May 2015, over defendants' objections, the court entered a partial verdict on class membership, product use causation, and economic damages and ordered a new trial on the remaining issues, including comparative fault and punitive damages.  Defendants' post-trial motions were denied. Defendants appealed to the  Fourth District Court of Appeal.  Briefing is complete.  Oral argument is set for January 24, 2017.  
    
  Cohen, D. v. R.J. Reynolds,     et al.  , Case No. 09-004042, Circuit Court of the 15   th    Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County (case filed 02/04/09).  This was a wrongful death action that proceeded to jury trial in April 2013.  In May 2013, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff on the negligence and strict liability claims and awarded compensatory damages in the amount of $2,055,000.  The jury apportioned fault as follows: Decedent - 40%, RJR - 30%, Lorillard - 20% and Liggett - 10% ($205,500).  In July 2013, the trial court granted defendants' motion for a new trial due to plaintiff's improper arguments during closing.  Plaintiff appealed and the defendants cross appealed to the Fourth District Court of Appeal. In September 2016, the Fourth District Court of Appeal affirmed the granting of a new trial.  Plaintiff filed a notice to invoke the discretionary jurisdiction of the Florida Supreme Court.  Jurisdictional briefing is underway. 
    
  Irimi v. R.J. Reynolds,     et al.  , Case No. 08-26337 19, Circuit Court of the 17   th    Judicial Circuit, Broward County (case filed 06/30/08).  This was a wrongful death action that proceeded to jury trial in July 2014.  In August  2014, the jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff and awarded compensatory damages in the amount of $3,123,426.  The jury apportioned fault as follows:  Decedent - 70%, R.J. Reynolds - 14.5%, Lorillard - 14.5% and Liggett - 1% ($31,234).  In January 2015, the court granted defendants' motion for a new trial. Plaintiff appealed to the Fourth District Court of Appeal and the defendants cross appealed.  Briefing is underway. 
    
  Putney v. R.J. Reynolds,     et al.  , Case No. 07-36668, Circuit Court of the 17   th    Judicial Circuit, Broward County (case filed 12/28/07). This was a wrongful death action that proceeded to jury trial in March 2010.  In April  2010, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff and awarded compensatory damages in the amount of $15,000,000.  The jury apportioned fault as follows: Decedent - 35%, R.J. Reynolds - 30%, Liggett - 20% ($3,008,138) and Philip Morris - 15%. No punitive damages were awarded against Liggett.  In December 2010, the trial court entered an amended final judgment to provide that interest would run from April 26, 2010.  In June 2013, the Fourth District Court of Appeal held that the trial court erred in entering summary judgment against defendants on their statute of repose defense and in denying the defendant's motion for remittitur of the compensatory damages.  As a result, the Fourth District Court of Appeal reversed and remanded for further proceedings.  In February 2016, the Florida Supreme Court reinstated the jury's verdict.  The Florida Supreme Court, on motion by defendants, clarified that its decision only reversed that part of the Fourth District Court of Appeal s decision relating to the statute of repose.   On remand from the Florida Supreme Court, the Fourth District Court of Appeal concluded that plaintiff need not prevail on her claim for fraudulent concealment in order to prevail on her claim for conspiracy to fraudulently conceal, holding that in the   Engle   progeny litigation, a plaintiff can prevail on an independent tort for conspiracy.  The Fourth District Court of Appeal further affirmed the trial court s granting of summary judgment on defendants  statute of repose defenses.  In light of that ruling, the Fourth District Court of Appeal directed the trial court on remand to reinstate the jury s punitive damages award against Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds. The Fourth District Court of Appeal reiterated that the trial court erred in not granting defendants  motions for remittitur of the consortium award to decedent s adult children.  Accordingly, on remand, the trial court will enter an order remitting the amount.  Either party may elect to reject the trial court s remittitur.  If the remittitur is rejected, the trial court will conduct a new trial on non-economic compensatory damages.      Plaintiff moved for an award of attorneys' fees against Liggett pursuant to the fee shifting provisions of Florida's proposal for settlement statute based on a settlement offer that was not accepted by Liggett.  The court granted the attorneys' fee motion with the amount to be determined in a future proceeding.  
    
  Ward v. R.J. Reynolds,     et al.  , Case No. 2008-CA-2135, Circuit Court of the 1   st    Judicial Circuit, Escambia County (case filed 12/13/07).  This was a wrongful death action that proceeded to jury trial in January 2012.  In January 2012, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff and awarded compensatory damages in the amount of $1,000,000.  The jury apportioned fault as follows: Decedent - 50%, R.J. Reynolds - 30%, Philip Morris - 10%, Lorillard - 9.9% and Liggett - 0.1% ($1,000).  No punitive damages were awarded against Liggett. Two of the  
  
   3 

defendants settled before trial.  A joint and several judgment was entered against Liggett and the other defendant for $487,000.  In September 2013, the First District Court of Appeal affirmed.  Liggett satisfied the merits judgment in January 2014.  In November 2015, the trial court awarded plaintiff $981,116 in attorneys  fees and costs and entered final judgment jointly and severally against Liggett and the other defendant.  Defendants appealed that final judgment and briefing is underway.  Other than the issue regarding attorneys' fees, this matter is concluded.

II.     CLASS ACTION CASES 
    
  In Re: Tobacco Litigation (Personal Injury Cases)  , Case No. 00-C-5000, Circuit Court, West Virginia, Ohio County (case filed 01/18/00).  Although not technically a class action, the court consolidated approximately 750 individual smoker actions that were pending prior to 2001 for trial of certain "common" issues.  Liggett was severed from trial of the consolidated action.  After two mistrials, in May 2013, the jury rejected all but one of the plaintiffs' claims, finding in favor of plaintiffs on the claim that ventilated filter cigarettes between 1964 and July 1, 1969 should have included instructions on how to use them. The issue of damages was reserved for further proceedings.  The court entered judgment in October  2013, dismissing all claims except the ventilated filter claim.  The judgment was affirmed on appeal and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.  In April 2015, the plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court which subsequently declined review.  In July 2015, the trial court ruled on the scope of the ventilated filter claim and determined that only 30 plaintiffs have potentially viable claims against the non-Liggett defendants, which may be pursued in a second phase of the trial.  The court intends to try the claims of these plaintiffs in six consolidated trials, each with five plaintiffs.  The trial court set the first date for the consolidated trials for January 9, 2017.  With respect to Liggett, the trial court requested that Liggett and plaintiffs brief whether any claims against Liggett survive given the outcome of the first phase of the trial.  On May 23, 2016, the trial court ruled that the case could proceed against Liggett.  Liggett requested that the trial court certify the matter to the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, for review, but the trial court refused.    I  t is estimated that Liggett could be a defendant in approximately 75 individual cases.  The parties are in the process of preparing a scheduling order to govern the Phase I common issues pre-trial proceedings. 
    
  Parsons,     et al.     v. A C   S Inc.,     et al.  , Case No. 98-C-388, Circuit Court, West Virginia, Ohio County (case filed 02/09/98).  This purported class action is brought on behalf of plaintiff's decedent and all West Virginia residents who allegedly have personal injury claims arising from their exposure to cigarette smoke and asbestos fibers.  The complaint seeks to recover unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for all potential members of the class.  The case is stayed as a result of the December 2000 bankruptcy petitions filed by three defendants (Nitral Liquidators, Inc., Desseaux Corporation of North America and Armstrong World Industries) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.

Young,     et al.     v. American Brands Inc.,     et al.  , Case No. 97-19984cv, Civil District Court, Louisiana, Orleans Parish (case filed 11/12/97).  This purported personal injury class action is brought on behalf of plaintiff and all similarly situated residents in Louisiana who, though not themselves cigarette smokers, were exposed to secondhand smoke from cigarettes that were manufactured by the defendants, including  Liggett, and suffered injury as a result of that exposure. The plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages.  No class certification hearing has been held. The case has been stayed for a number of years, with the stay renewed every few years.  The last stay was entered on March 16, 2016 and stays the case, including all discovery, pending the completion of the smoking cessation program ordered by the court in   Scott v. The American Tobacco Co  .
