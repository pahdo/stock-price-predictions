TELEDYNE TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 
  October 2, 2016    

Note 1. General 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by Teledyne Technologies Incorporated ( Teledyne  or the  Company ) pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and disclosures normally included in notes to consolidated financial statements have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, but resultant disclosures are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States as they apply to interim reporting. The condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes in Teledyne s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 3, 2016   (   2015   Form 10-K ). 
  In the opinion of Teledyne s management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly, in all material respects, Teledyne s consolidated financial position as of   October 2, 2016   and the consolidated results of operations and consolidated comprehensive income for the three and nine months then ended and cash flows for the nine months then ended.  The results of operations and cash flows for the periods ended   October 2, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations or cash flows to be expected for any subsequent quarter or the full fiscal year.  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.   
  In the third quarter of 2016, Teledyne sold assets of the Printed Circuit Technology ( PCT ) business for $  9.3 million   in cash.  As a result, these financial statements reflect the classification of our PCT business as a discontinued operation.  See Note 14 to these condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information.  
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  The ASU is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period.  Teledyne elected to adopt early this ASU in the third quarter of 2016, therefore Teledyne is required to report the material impacts of this standard as though the ASU had been adopted at the beginning of the fiscal year.  Accordingly, Teledyne recognized additional income tax benefits as an increase to net income of $  4.0 million   and $  5.8 million   during the third quarter and nine months ended October 2, 2016. The adjustments for the third quarter included only the quarterly impacts, whereas the adjustments for the first nine months of 2016 include the first and second quarter additional income tax benefits of $  0.6 million   and $  1.2 million  , respectively and the immaterial impact for reclassification of amounts from financing activities to operating activities in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.  Teledyne has elected to record forfeitures as they occur, which did not have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial results.  The new guidance did not impact any periods prior to our 2016 fiscal year, as the changes were applied on a prospective basis. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date by one year, but will allow early adoption as of the original adoption date.  This new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, and can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company is currently in the process of determining its implementation approach and evaluating the impact this guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The new guidance will require lessees to recognize almost all leases on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, other than leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease.  For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance.  The new guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim

periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The new guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition, requiring application at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.

Note 3. Business Combinations, Dispositions, Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets 
  On May 3, 2016, Teledyne DALSA, Inc., a Canadian-based subsidiary, acquired the assets and business of CARIS, Inc. ( CARIS ) for an initial cash payment of $  26.6 million  , net of cash acquired.  Teledyne received a $  0.4 million   purchase price adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2016.  Based in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, CARIS is a leading developer of geospatial software designed for the hydrographic and marine community and is part of the Digital Imaging segment.  
  On April 15, 2016, Teledyne LeCroy, Inc., a U.S.-based subsidiary, acquired assets of Quantum Data, Inc. ( Quantum Data ) for $  17.3 million   in cash.  Based in Elgin, Illinois, Quantum Data provides electronic test and measurement instrumentation and is a market leader in video protocol analysis test tools.  On April 6, 2016, Teledyne LeCroy, Inc. also acquired Frontline Test Equipment, Inc. ( Frontline ) for $  13.7 million   in cash.  Based in Charlottesville, Virginia, Frontline provides electronic test and measurement instrumentation and is a market leader in wireless protocol analysis test tools.  Quantum Data and Frontline are part of the Instrumentation segment.

Teledyne spent $  66.7 million   on acquisitions and other investments in 2015, of which $  63.7 million   was spent in the first nine months of 2015.  In June 2015, Teledyne DALSA BV, a Netherlands-based subsidiary, acquired Industrial Control Machines SA.  In April 2015, Teledyne DALSA, Inc. acquired the remaining   49%   noncontrolling interest in the parent company of Optech Incorporated.  On February 2015, Teledyne acquired Bowtech Products Limited through a U.K.-based subsidiary.  Also in 2016 and 2015, Teledyne made additional investments in Ocean Aero, Inc. 
  Teledyne funded the purchases from borrowings under its credit facility and cash on hand.  The results of the acquisitions have been included in Teledyne s results since the dates of the respective acquisition.  
  For a further description of the Company s acquisition activity for the fiscal year ended   January 3, 2016  , please refer to Note 3 of our   2015   Form 10-K.     
  Teledyne s goodwill was   $1,183.5 million   at   October 2, 2016   and   $1,140.2 million   at   January 3, 2016  . The increase in the balance of goodwill in   2016   included $  40.5 million   in goodwill from recent acquisitions and also the impact of exchange rate changes.  Goodwill from the 2016 acquisitions will be deductible for tax purposes.  Teledyne s net acquired intangible assets were   $237.7 million   at   October 2, 2016   and   $243.3 million   at   January 3, 2016  .  The decrease in the balance of acquired intangible assets in   2016   reflected $  21.5 million   of amortization, partially offset by $  15.6 million   of intangible assets from recent acquisitions.  The Company is in the process of specifically identifying the amount to be assigned to certain assets, including acquired intangible assets, and liabilities and the related impact on taxes and goodwill for the 2016 acquisitions.  The Company made preliminary estimates as of October 2, 2016 since there was insufficient time between the acquisition dates and the end of the period to finalize the analysis. 
  See Note 14 to these condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on the sale of the PCT business. 
  In the second quarter of 2016, Teledyne sold a former operating facility in California for net proceeds of $  19.5 million  . The gain on the sale of $  17.9 million   is included in other income.  In conjunction with the sale of this former operating facility, Teledyne entered into a like-kind exchange agreement under Section 1031 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code with a qualified intermediary.  Pursuant to the like-kind exchange agreement, the net proceeds of $  19.5 million   were placed into an escrow account administered by a qualified intermediary.  Accordingly, the net proceeds of $  19.5 million   were classified as restricted cash on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of October 2, 2016.  On October 14, 2016, Teledyne completed the Section 1031 like-kind real estate exchange and the restricted cash was used in the transaction. 
   
  Note 4. Derivative Instruments 
  Teledyne transacts business in various foreign currencies and has international sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, subjecting the Company to foreign currency risk. The Company s primary foreign currency risk management objective is to protect the United States dollar value of future cash flows and minimize the volatility of reported earnings.  All derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. As discussed below, the accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting.  The Company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenues and expenses denominated in Canadian dollars for our Canadian companies, including DALSA.  These contracts are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges.  
  Cash Flow Hedging Activities 
  The effectiveness of the cash flow hedge contracts, excluding time value, is assessed prospectively and retrospectively on a monthly basis using regression analysis, as well as using other timing and probability criteria. To receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedges and must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions. The effective portion of the cash flow hedge contracts  gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is initially reported, net of tax, as a component of AOCI in stockholders  equity until the underlying hedged item is reflected in our consolidated statements of income, at which time the effective amount in AOCI is reclassified to cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI, net of tax, for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total   $0.1 million  . These gains are expected to be offset by anticipated losses in the value of the forecasted underlying hedged item.  
  In the event that the gains or losses in AOCI are deemed to be ineffective, the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value, if any, is reclassified to other income and expense. In the event that the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur, or it becomes remote that they will occur, within the defined hedge period, the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges will be reclassified from AOCI to other income and expense. During the current reporting period, all forecasted transactions occurred and, therefore, there were no such gains or losses reclassified to other income and expense. As of   October 2, 2016  , Teledyne had foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy Canadian dollars  
  
   9 

     Table of Contents  

and to sell U.S. dollars totaling   $62.7 million  .   These foreign currency forward contracts have maturities ranging from December 2016 to February 2018. 
  The effect of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges in the condensed consolidated financial statements for the   third quarter   and nine months ended   October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015   was as follows (in millions):   

     a)    Effective portion, pre-tax 
     b)     Amount excluded from effectiveness testing 
  Non-Designated Hedging Activities 
  In addition, the Company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign exchange rate risk associated with foreign-currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities, including intercompany receivables and payables.  As of   October 2, 2016  , Teledyne had foreign currency contracts of this type in the following pairs (in millions): 

The above table includes non-designated hedges derived from terms contained in triggered or previously designated cash flow hedges. The gains and losses on these derivatives which are not designated as hedging instruments are intended to, at a minimum, partially offset the transaction gains and losses recognized in earnings. Teledyne does not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. 
  The effect of derivative instruments not designated as cash flow hedges recognized in other income and expense for the   third quarter   and nine months ended   October 2, 2016   was expense of   $1.3 million   and   $0.9 million  , respectively. The effect of derivative instruments not designated as cash flow hedges in other income and expense for the third quarter and nine months ended September 27, 2015 was expense of   $4.6 million   and   $7.1 million  , respectively.

Note 5. Earnings Per Share 
  Basic and diluted earnings per share were computed based on net earnings. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period was used in the calculation of basic earnings per share.  The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding increased by contingent dilutive shares that could be issued under:  1) various compensation plans, including the dilutive effect of stock options based on the treasury stock method, and 2) the forward contract feature of the accelerated repurchase program.    
  On February 2, 2015, the Company entered into a $  142.0 million   accelerated share repurchase ( ASR ) agreement with a financial institution ( ASR Counterparty ) in a privately negotiated transaction for   1,500,000   shares of the Company's common stock.  Pursuant to the ASR agreement, in February 2015, the Company advanced $  142.0 million   to the ASR counterparty and received   1,425,000   shares of common stock, which used $  134.9 million   of the $  142.0 million   advanced.  In November 2015, the February 2015 ASR was settled with the Company making a payment of $  1.2 million  .  In November 2015, the Company entered into a $  100.5 million   ASR agreement with a financial institution in a privately negotiated transaction for   1,100,000   shares of the Company's common stock.  Pursuant to the ASR agreement, the Company advanced $  100.5 million   to the ASR Counterparty and received   1,045,000   shares of common stock.  On February 19, 2016, the November 2015 ASR was settled and Teledyne received   135,374   shares of common stock. In 2015, the Company spent a total of $  243.8 million   to repurchase a total of   2,561,815   shares of its common stock.  
  On January 26, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors authorized an additional stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to an additional   3,000,000   shares of its common stock.  The 2015 and 2016 stock repurchase authorizations are expected to remain open continuously, with respect to the shares remaining thereunder, and the number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, such as share price, levels of cash and borrowing capacity available, alternative investment opportunities available immediately or longer-term, and other regulatory, market or economic conditions.  Future repurchases are expected to be funded with cash on hand and borrowings under the Company's credit facility.   No   repurchases have been made under this authorization in 2016. For a further description of the Company s stock repurchase program, please refer to Note 8 of the 2015 Form 10-K. 
  For the third quarter of 2016,   no   stock options were excluded in the computation of diluted earnings per share.  For the first nine months of   2016  ,   336,457   stock options were excluded in the computation of diluted earnings per share because they had exercise prices that were greater than the weighted average market price of the Company s common stock during the period. For the third quarter and the first nine months of   2015  ,   no   stock options were excluded in the computation of diluted earnings per share.

Note 6. Stock-Based Compensation Plans 
  Teledyne has long-term incentive plans pursuant to which it has granted non-qualified stock options, restricted stock and performance shares to certain employees. The Company also has non-employee director stock compensation plans, pursuant to which non-qualified stock options and common stock, and beginning in 2015 restricted stock units, have been issued to its directors.  After 2014, non-employee directors no longer receive non-qualified stock options.  
  Stock Incentive Plan 
  The following disclosures are based on stock options granted to Teledyne s employees and directors. Stock option compensation expense was   $2.5 million   and $  8.8 million   for the   third quarter   and first nine months of   2016  , respectively.   Stock option compensation expense was   $2.6 million   and $  9.7 million   for the   third quarter   and first nine months of 2015.  Employee stock option grants are charged to expense evenly over the   three   year vesting period.  For   2016  , the Company currently expects approximately   $11.5 million   in stock option compensation expense based on stock options currently outstanding.  This amount can be impacted by employee retirements and terminations or stock options granted during the remainder of the year.  The Company issues shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock options.   No   stock options were granted in 2015.  
  The following assumptions were used in the valuation of stock options granted in 2016:

Performance Share Plan and Restricted Stock Award Program 
  In the first quarter of 2016, the Company issued   864   shares of Teledyne common stock under the 2012 to 2014 Performance Share Plan.  A maximum of   1,883   shares remain to be issued in 2017 under the plan. 
  The following table shows the restricted stock activity for fiscal year 2016:   

Note 7. Inventories 
  Inventories are stated at current cost net of reserves for excess, slow moving and obsolete inventory, less progress payments. Inventories are valued under the FIFO method, LIFO method and average cost method. Inventories at cost determined on the average cost or the FIFO methods were   $235.8 million   at   October 2, 2016   and   $239.0 million   at   January 3, 2016  .  The remainder of the inventories using the LIFO method were   $110.0 million   at   October 2, 2016   and   $91.6 million   at   January 3, 2016  .  Interim LIFO calculations are based on the Company s estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs since an actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method can be made only at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Because these are subject to many factors beyond the Company s control, interim results are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory valuation.    

Note 8. Supplemental Balance Sheet Information 
  The following table presents the balance of selected components of Teledyne s balance sheet:

     Table of Contents  

Some of the Company s products are subject to specified warranties, and the Company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties. The adequacy of the warranty reserve is assessed regularly, and the reserve is adjusted as necessary based on a review of historic warranty experience with respect to the applicable business or products, as well as the length and actual terms of the warranties. The warranty reserve is included in current and long-term accrued liabilities on the balance sheet.   

Note 9. Income Taxes 
  The income tax provision is calculated using an estimated annual effective tax rate, based upon expected annual income, permanent items, statutory rates and planned tax strategies in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. However, losses in certain jurisdictions and discrete items, such as the resolution of uncertain tax positions, are treated separately. 
  The Company s effective income tax rate for the   third quarter   and first nine months of   2016   was   17.2%   and   24.1%  , respectively.  The Company s effective income tax rate for the   third quarter   and first nine months of 2015 was   21.8%   and   26.4%  , respectively.  The   third quarter   of   2016   included net discrete income tax benefits of   $6.6 million   compared with net discrete income tax benefits of   $7.4 million   for the   third quarter   of   2015  .  The first nine months of 2016 included $  1.5 million   in net discrete income tax benefits, compared with net discrete income tax benefits of $  8.5 million   for the first nine months of 2015.  The net discrete income tax benefit for the first nine months of 2016 includes $  6.7 million   in income tax expense related to the $  17.9 million   gain on the sale of the former operating facility.  In addition, in the third quarter of 2016, Teledyne elected to adopt ASU 2016-09, which is in advance of the mandatory 2017 effective date and includes a change in accounting for income taxes associated with share-based compensation.  Teledyne is required to report the impacts as though the ASU had been adopted at the beginning of its 2016 fiscal year.  As a result of the early adoption, in the third quarter of 2016, Teledyne recorded a $  4.0 million   income tax benefit.  The tax benefit related to the adoption for the first and second quarters of 2016, was $  0.6 million   and $  1.2 million  , respectively. 
  Excluding net discrete income tax items in both periods, and the gain and related taxes on the facility sale in 2016, the effective tax rates would have been   27.5%   for the   third quarter   and   27.6%   for the first nine months of 2016 and   33.5%   for the   third quarter   and   30.9%   for the first nine months of 2015.  
   
  Note 10. Long-Term Debt, Capital Lease and Letters of Credit   

  (a)  Includes debt issue costs associated with the term loans and senior notes of $  1.2 million   at October 2, 2016 and $  1.4 million   at January 3, 2016.

Available borrowing capacity under the   $750.0 million   credit facility, which is reduced by borrowings and certain outstanding letters of credit, was   $738.8 million   at   October 2, 2016  . The credit agreements require the Company to comply with various financial and operating covenants and at   October 2, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with these covenants.      
  Teledyne estimates the fair value of its long-term debt based on debt of similar type, rating and maturity and at comparable interest rates. The Company s long-term debt is considered a level 2 fair value hierarchy and is valued based on observable market data.  The estimated fair value of Teledyne s long-term debt at   October 2, 2016   and   January 3, 2016  , approximated the carrying value.  
  At   October 2, 2016  , the Company had   $6.7 million   in capital leases, of which   $0.9 million   is current.  At   January 3, 2016  , the Company had   $8.6 million   in capital leases, of which   $1.2 million   was current.  At   October 2, 2016  , Teledyne had   $12.1 million   in outstanding letters of credit.   
   
  Note 11. Lawsuits, Claims, Commitments, Contingencies and Related Matters 
  For a further description of the Company s commitments and contingencies, reference is made to Note 14 of the Company s financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended   January 3, 2016  , included in the   2015   Form 10-K. 
  At   October 2, 2016  , the Company s reserves for environmental remediation obligations totaled   $7.8 million  , of which   $4.6 million   is included in current accrued liabilities.  The Company periodically evaluates whether it may be able to recover a portion of future costs for environmental liabilities from its insurance carriers and from third parties. The timing of expenditures depends on a number of factors that vary by site, including the nature and extent of contamination, the number of potentially responsible parties, the timing of regulatory approvals, the complexity of the investigation and remediation, and the standards for remediation. The Company expects that it will expend present accruals over many years and will complete remediation of all sites with which it has been identified in up to   30 years  . 
  A number of other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against the Company, including those pertaining to product liability, acquisitions, patent infringement, contracts, environmental, employment and employee benefits matters. While the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and some of these lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be determined adversely to the Company, management does not believe that the disposition of any such pending matters is likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial statements.  
   
  Note 12. Pension Plans and Postretirement Benefits 
  In the first quarter of 2015, Teledyne froze its non-qualified pension plan for top executives which resulted in a one-time gain of   $1.2 million   in the first quarter of 2015.  For the domestic pension plan, the discount rate increased to   4.91   percent in   2016   compared with a   4.5   percent discount rate used in   2015  .   Pension expense allocated to contracts pursuant to U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards ( CAS ) was   $3.5 million   and $  10.4 million   for the   third   quarter and first nine months of   2016  , respectively.  Pension expense allocated to contracts pursuant to CAS was $  3.4 million   and $  10.3 million   for the third quarter and first nine months of 2015, respectively.  Pension expense determined under CAS can generally be recovered through the pricing of products and services sold to the U.S. Government. Teledyne did not make any cash pension contributions to its domestic pension plan in   2016   or 2015.    No   cash pension contributions are planned for   2016   for the domestic pension plan.

Note 14. Discontinued Operations 
  In the third quarter of 2016, Teledyne completed the disposition of the net assets of its PCT business for $  9.3 million   in cash, resulting in no gain or loss.  The sale represented a disposition of a component that was outside the Company s current strategy and met the criteria to be classified as held for sale in the second quarter.  As such, the PCT component met the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations during the second quarter of 2016. Prior to being classified within discontinued operations, PCT was included in the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment. In connection with the sale, the Company entered into a transition services agreement, effective July 8, 2016, to provide certain services to facilitate the orderly transfer of the business operations to the buyer, with the transition services agreement expected to continue through the first quarter of 2017.

Item 2.    Management     s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
   
  Teledyne Technologies Incorporated provides enabling technologies for industrial growth markets. We have evolved from a company that was primarily focused on aerospace and defense to one that serves multiple markets that require advanced technology and high reliability. These markets include deepwater oil and gas exploration and production, oceanographic research, air and water quality environmental monitoring, factory automation and medical imaging. Our products include monitoring instrumentation for marine and environmental applications, harsh environment interconnects, electronic test and measurement equipment, digital imaging sensors and cameras, aircraft information management systems, and defense electronics and satellite communication subsystems. We also supply engineered systems for defense, space, environmental and energy applications. We differentiate ourselves from many of our direct competitors by having a customer and company sponsored applied research center that augments our product development expertise. 
  Strategy/Overview 
  Our strategy continues to emphasize growth in our core markets of instrumentation, digital imaging, aerospace and defense electronics and engineered systems. Our core markets are characterized by high barriers to entry and include specialized products and services not likely to be commoditized. We intend to strengthen and expand our core businesses with targeted acquisitions and through product development.  We continue to focus on balanced and disciplined capital deployment among capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases.  We aggressively pursue operational excellence to continually improve our margins and earnings. At Teledyne, operational excellence includes the rapid integration of the businesses we acquire. Using complementary technology across our businesses and internal research and development, we seek to create new products to grow our company and expand our addressable markets. We continue to evaluate our businesses to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy. 
  During 2016, as part of a continuing effort to reduce costs and improve operating performance we took actions to consolidate and relocate certain facilities and reduce headcount across various businesses, reducing our exposure to weak end markets and high cost locations.  In connection with these efforts, in the first nine months of 2016, we incurred pretax charges totaling $12.7 million for severance and facility consolidation expense.  The charges were comprised of $7.6 million in severance related expenses and $5.1 million in facility closure and relocation expenses.  The first nine months of 2016 also included $1.0 million in asset impairment expense.  While substantially all of these actions have been completed, Teledyne will continue to incur severance and facility consolidation expenses during the remainder of 2016.  We incurred $5.9 million of severance related expenses in the first nine months of 2015, partially offset by the reversal of reserves of $1.7 million that were no longer needed.  In addition, in the second quarter of 2016, we completed the sale of a former operating facility located in California as those operations were consolidated with another facility.  The pretax gain on this sale was $17.9 million and is included in other income.  In the first nine months of 2015, other income included a second quarter gain on a legal settlement of $3.0 million.  Also in the first nine months of 2016, we completed the acquisitions of two test and measurement instrumentation companies and one imaging software company. 
  In connection with our strategy, in the third quarter of 2016, Teledyne completed the disposition of the net assets of its Printed Circuit Technology ( PCT ) business for $9.3 million in cash.  The sale represented a disposition of a component that was outside the Company s current strategy and met the criteria to be classified as held for sale in the second quarter.  As such, the PCT component met the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations during the second quarter of 2016. Prior to being classified within discontinued operations, PCT was included in the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment. In connection with the sale, the Company entered into a transition services agreement, effective July 8, 2016, to provide certain administrative services to facilitate the orderly transfer of the business operations to the buyer, with the transition services agreement expected to continue through the first quarter of 2017. 
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  The ASU is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period.  Teledyne elected to adopt early this ASU in the third quarter of 2016, therefore Teledyne is required to report the material impacts of this standard as though the ASU had been adopted at the beginning of the fiscal year.  Accordingly, Teledyne recognized additional income tax benefits as an increase to net income of $4.0 million and $5.8 million during the third quarter and nine months ended October 2, 2016. The adjustments for the third quarter included only the quarterly impacts, whereas the adjustments for the first nine months of 2016 include the first and second quarter additional income tax benefits of $0.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively and the immaterial impact for reclassification of amounts from financing activities to operating activities in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.  Teledyne has elected to record forfeitures as they occur, which did not have a material impact on the

     Table of Contents  

condensed consolidated financial results.  The new guidance did not impact any periods prior our 2016 fiscal year, as the changes were applied on a prospective basis.

Third   quarter of   2016   compared with the   third   quarter of   2015    
  Our   third   quarter   2016   sales were   $526.8 million  , compared with sales  of   $551.7 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015  , a decrease of   4.5%  .  Net income from continuing operations was   $53.1 million   for the third quarter of 2016, compared with   $49.8 million   for the third quarter of 2015, an increase of 6.6%.  Net income from continuing operations per diluted share was   $1.49   for the third quarter of 2016, compared with net income from continuing operations per diluted share of   $1.38   for the third quarter of 2015.  Net income attributable to Teledyne was   $52.0 million   (  $1.46   per diluted share) for the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared with net income attributable to Teledyne of   $48.3 million   (  $1.34   per diluted share) for the   third   quarter of   2015  , an increase of   7.7%  .   
  Sales 
  The   third   quarter of   2016   sales, compared with the   third   quarter of   2015   sales, reflected lower sales in the Instrumentation segment, partially offset by higher sales in each of the other three segments.    Third   quarter 2016 sales included $7.7 million from recent acquisitions.  
  Cost of Sales 
  Cost of sales decreased   $23.3 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared with the   third   quarter of   2015  , which primarily reflected the impact of lower sales.  Cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the   third   quarter of   2016   decreased to   60.2%   from 61.7% for the third quarter of 2015.   
  Certain contracts are accounted for under the percentage of completion ( POC ) method and related contract cost and revenue estimates for significant contracts are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. The aggregate effects of these changes in estimates on contracts accounted for under the POC accounting method, in the   third   quarter of   2016   and   2015  , were   $7.9 million   and   $7.0 million   of favorable operating income and   $8.8 million   and   $10.1 million   of unfavorable operating income, respectively.  None of the effects of changes in estimates on any individual contract were material to the condensed consolidated statements of income for any period presented.  
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses, including research and development and bid and proposal expense, decreased   $0.3 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared with the   third   quarter of   2015  .  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the   third   quarter of   2016  , as a percentage of sales increased to   26.4%   compared with 25.3% for the third quarter of 2015.  Corporate expense was   $11.1 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared with   $8.9 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015   and reflected higher compensation and professional fees expense.  In the   third   quarter of   2016   and   2015  , we recorded a total of   $2.5 million   and   $2.6 million  , respectively, in stock option compensation expense.  
  Pension Income/Expense 
  Pension income or expense is included in both cost of sales and selling general and administrative expense.  The   third   quarter of   2016   included pension income of   $0.5 million  , compared with pension expense of   $1.0 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .   For   2016  , the discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation for the domestic plan was   4.91   percent compared with   4.5   percent in   2015  .  Pension expense allocated to contracts pursuant to U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards ( CAS ) was   $3.5 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016   and was $3.4 million for the   third   quarter of   2015  .  Pension expense determined allowable under CAS can generally be recovered through the pricing of products and services sold to the U.S. Government. 
  Operating Income 
  Operating income was   $70.5 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared with   $71.8 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015  , a decrease of   1.8%  .  The   third   quarter of   2016  , compared with the   third   quarter of   2015  , reflected lower operating income in the Instrumentation segment, partially offset by higher operating income in each of the other three segments.  
  Interest Expense and Other Income/Expense 
  Interest expense, net of interest income, was   $5.6 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared with   $6.0 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015  .  Other income and expense was expense of   $0.7 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared with $2.1 million of expense for the   third   quarter of   2015  .

Income Taxes  
  The income tax provision is calculated using an estimated annual effective tax rate, based upon estimates of annual income, permanent items, statutory tax rates and planned tax strategies in the various jurisdictions in which we operate except that certain loss jurisdictions and discrete items, such as the resolution of uncertain tax positions, are treated separately.

In February 2015, the Company entered into a $142.0 million accelerated share repurchase ( ASR ) agreement.  Pursuant to the ASR agreement, in February 2015, the Company advanced $142.0 million to the ASR counterparty and received 1,425,000 shares of common stock, which used $134.9 million of the $142.0 million advanced, representing 95% of the estimated shares to be repurchased under the ASR agreement.  On January 26, 2016, Teledyne s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program for up to an additional 3,000,000 shares of Teledyne common stock.  No repurchases have been made under this authorization in 2016.      
  Our principal cash and capital requirements are to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, income tax payments, pension contributions, debt service requirements and the stock repurchase program, as well as acquisitions. It is anticipated that operating cash flow, together with available borrowings under the credit facility described below, will be sufficient to meet these requirements over the next twelve months. We may raise other forms of debt capital, depending on financial, market and economic conditions.  We may need to raise additional capital to support acquisitions.  Excluding the recent facility purchase with restricted cash, we currently expect to spend up to $60.0 million for capital expenditures in   2016  , of which   $44.9 million   has been spent in the first   nine   months of   2016  .  No cash pension contributions have been made in 2016 or are planned for the remainder of 2016 for the domestic pension plan. 
  Total debt, including capital lease obligations, at   October 2, 2016   was   $613.0 million  .   At October 2, 2016, no amounts are outstanding under the   $750.0 million   credit facility.  At   October 2, 2016  , Teledyne had   $12.1 million   in outstanding letters of credit. Available borrowing capacity under the $750.0 million credit facility, which is reduced by borrowings and certain outstanding letters of credit, was   $738.8 million   at   October 2, 2016  . The credit agreements require the Company to comply with various financial and operating covenants and at   October 2, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with these covenants.

     Table of Contents  

As of   October 2, 2016  , the Company had a significant amount of margin between required financial covenant ratios and our actual ratios. At   October 2, 2016  , the required financial ratios and the actual ratios were as follows:   

            a) 
    The Consolidated Leverage Ratio is equal to Net Debt/EBITDA as defined in our private placement note purchase agreement and our $750.0 million credit agreement. 
               b) 
    The Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio is equal to EBITDA/Interest as defined in our private placement note purchase agreement and our $750.0 million credit agreement. 
     Our liquidity is not dependent upon the use of off-balance sheet financial arrangements. We have no off-balance sheet financing arrangements that incorporate the use of special purpose entities or unconsolidated entities. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  Our critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Our critical accounting policies are the following: revenue recognition; accounting for pension plans; accounting for business combinations, goodwill, acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets; and accounting for income taxes.  
  For additional discussion of the application of the critical accounting policies and other accounting policies, see Note 1 to these condensed consolidated financial statements and also Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Critical Accounting Policies and Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Teledyne s   2015   Form 10-K. 
   
  Safe Harbor Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information 
  From time to time we make, and this report contains, forward looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, relating to earnings, growth opportunities, acquisitions and divestitures, product sales, capital expenditures, pension matters, stock option compensation expense, the credit facility, interest expense, severance and relocation and facility consolidation costs, environmental remediation costs, stock repurchases, taxes, exchange rates and strategic plans.  Forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as  estimate ,  project ,  predict ,  believes  or  expect , that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. All statements made in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in other sections of this Form 10-Q that are not historical in nature should be considered forward-looking. 
  Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements.  Many factors could change the anticipated results, including: disruptions in the global economy; changes in demand for products sold to the defense electronics, instrumentation, digital imaging, energy exploration and production, commercial aviation, semiconductor and communications markets; funding, continuation and award of government programs; cuts to defense spending resulting from existing and future deficit reduction measures; impacts from the United Kingdom's decision to exit the European Union; and threats to the security of our confidential and proprietary information, including cyber security threats. Lower oil and natural gas prices, as well as instability in the Middle East or other oil producing regions, and new regulations or restrictions relating to energy production, including with respect to hydraulic fracturing, could negatively affect the Company s businesses that supply the oil and gas industry. Increasing fuel costs could negatively affect the markets of our commercial aviation businesses.  In addition, financial market fluctuations affect the value of the Company s pension assets.  Changes in the policies of U.S. and foreign governments, could result, over time, in reductions and realignment in defense or other government spending and further changes in programs in which the company participates. 
  While the company s growth strategy includes possible acquisitions, we cannot provide any assurance as to when, if or on what terms any acquisitions will be made. Acquisitions involve various inherent risks, such as, among others, our ability to integrate acquired businesses, retain customers and achieve identified financial and operating synergies. There are additional risks  
  
   30 

     Table of Contents  

associated with acquiring, owning and operating businesses outside of the United States, including those arising from U.S. and foreign government policy changes or actions and exchange rate fluctuations. 
  While we believe our internal and disclosure control systems are effective, there are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
  Readers are urged to read our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a more complete description of our Company, its businesses, its strategies and the various risks that we face. Various risks are identified in Teledyne s   2015   Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Q's. 
  We assume no duty to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or otherwise. 
   
  Item 3.      Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  Except as set forth below, there were no material changes to the information provided under  Item 7A, Quantitative and    Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk  included in our   2015   Form 10-K. 
   
  Market Risk 
  We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Foreign currency forward contracts are used primarily to hedge anticipated exposures. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
   
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
  Notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate portions of our foreign currency exchange rate risks, there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. A hypothetical 10 percent price change in the U.S. dollar from its value at   October 2, 2016   would result in a decrease or increase in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy Canadian dollars and to sell U.S. dollars by approximately   $6.3 million  .  For additional information please see Derivative Instruments discussed in Note 4 to these condensed consolidated financial statements. 
   
  Interest Rate Exposure 
  We are exposed to market risk through the interest rate on our borrowings under our $750.0 million credit facility and our   $182.5 million   in term loans.  Borrowings under our credit facility and our term loans are at variable rates which are, at our option, tied to a Eurocurrency rate equal to LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus an applicable rate or a base rate as defined in our credit agreements.  Eurocurrency rate loans may be denominated in U.S. dollars or an alternative currency as defined in the credit agreements.  Eurocurrency or LIBOR based loans under the credit facility typically have terms of one, two, three or nine months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date.  The Company has not drawn any loans with a term longer than three months under the credit facility.  Base rate loans have interest rates that primarily fluctuate with changes in the prime rate.  Interest rates are also subject to change based on our consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreements.  As of   October 2, 2016  , we had   $182.5 million   in outstanding indebtedness under our term loans and no amounts outstanding under our credit facility.  A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately   $1.8 million  , assuming the   $182.5 million   in debt was outstanding for the full year. 
   
                 Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures 
   
 Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, with the participation and assistance of other members of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures, as of   October 2, 2016  , are effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
  In connection with our evaluation during the quarterly period ended   October 2, 2016  , we have made no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.

                 Item 2. 
    Unregistered sales of equity securities and use of proceeds 

The Teledyne Technologies Incorporated 401(k) Plan (the  Plan ) includes shares of Teledyne common stock as an investment choice for participants. The Plan trustee purchases shares of Teledyne common stock on the open market, and then allocates the shares to participants  Plan accounts at the election of participants. In July 2016, we determined that since April 5, 2001, participants in the Plan may have purchased more shares of Teledyne common stock than were registered under the Securities Act of 1933. We did not receive any consideration in connection with such purchases, which were funded with participants  contributions to the Plan. On August 17, 2016, we filed a Form S-8 registration statement to register up to 1,000,000 shares of Teledyne Common Stock for future purchases by the Plan.
