Forward
Looking Statements  

This
report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the  Exchange Act ). Forward-looking statements are typically identified by the words  believe,   expect, 
 intend,   estimate  and similar expressions. Those statements appear in a number of places in this report
and include statements regarding our intent, belief or current expectations or those of our directors or officers with respect
to, among other things, trends affecting our financial condition and results of operations and our business and growth strategies.
These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results
may differ materially from those projected, expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors
(such factors are referred to herein as  Cautionary Statements ), including but not limited to the following: (i)
we have limited operating history as a REIT; (ii) our loan origination activities, revenues and profits are limited by available
funds (iii)we operate in a highly competitive market and competition may limit our ability to originate loans with favorable interest
rates; (iv) our chief executive officer is critical to our business and our future success may depend on our ability to retain
him; (v) if we overestimate the yields on our loans or incorrectly value the collateral securing the loan, we may experience losses;
(vi) we may be subject to  lender liability  claims; (vii) our loan portfolio is illiquid; (viii) our due diligence
may not uncover all of a borrower s liabilities or other risks to its business; (ix) borrower concentration could lead to
significant losses; (x) our management has no experience managing a REIT; and (xi) we may choose to make distributions in our
own stock, in which case you may be required to pay income taxes in excess of the cash dividends you receive. The accompanying
information contained in this report, including the information set forth under  Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , identifies important factors that could cause such differences. These
forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report, and we caution potential investors not to place undue reliance
on such statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. All subsequent written or oral
forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the
Cautionary Statements.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
  September 30, 2016    

1. THE
COMPANY  

The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Manhattan Bridge Capital, Inc. ( MBC ), a New York corporation
founded in 1989, and its consolidated subsidiaries, DAG Funding Solutions, Inc. ( DAG Funding ), a New York corporation
formed in May 2007 (dissolved in September 2016), and MBC Funding II Corp. ( MBC Funding II ), a New York corporation
formed in December 2015 (collectively referred to herein as the  Company ) have been prepared by the Company in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with instructions
to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.
However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair
presentation have been included. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with
the Company s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the notes thereto included
in the Company s Form 10-K. Results of consolidated operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of
the operating results to be attained in the entire fiscal year.  

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could differ
from those estimates.  

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MBC, DAG Funding and MBC Funding II. All significant intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

The
Company offers short-term, secured, non banking loans to real estate investors (also known as hard money) to fund their
acquisition and construction of properties located in the New York Metropolitan area.  

The
Company recognizes revenues in accordance with ASC 605, which provides guidance on the recognition, presentation and disclosure
of revenue in financial statements. ASC 605 outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance
for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies. In general, the Company recognizes revenue when (i) persuasive evidence
of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery of the product has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the sales price charged
is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.  

Interest
income from commercial loans is recognized, as earned, over the loan period.  

Origination
fee revenue on commercial loans is amortized over the term of the respective note.  

Costs
incurred in connection with the Company s line of credit (see Note 8) are being amortized over three years, using the straight-line
method. Costs incurred in connection with the senior secured note issued by MBC Funding II (see Note 9) are being amortized over
ten years, using the straight-line method.  

2. RECENT
TECHNICAL ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes .
The ASU simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified
as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This Update will align the presentation of deferred income tax
assets and liabilities with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). For public business entities, the ASU is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the
ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2018. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial
statements.  

In
January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement
of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities . The ASU intends to provide users of financial statements with more useful
information on the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. For public business entities,
the ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
For all other entities, the ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and for interim periods within
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for certain provisions. The adoption of this guidance
is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,    Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee
Share-Based Payment Accounting  .  The ASU simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment
transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements, and classification
in the statement of cash flows. For public companies, the ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016,
and interim periods within those fiscal years. For private companies, the ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2017, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption
of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses
on Financial Instruments . The ASU requires an organization to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held
at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts. For
public companies who file with the SEC, the ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim
periods within those fiscal years. For public business entities that are not SEC filers, the ASU is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For privately held companies, ASU 2016-13
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2021. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial
statements.  

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts
and Cash Payments - a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force.  The ASU is to amend ASC 230 to add or clarify guidance
on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. For public business entities, the
standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods
within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is
permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to
have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

Management
does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effected, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a
material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

3. CASH
- RESTRICTED  

Restricted
cash mainly represents collections received, pending clearance, from the Company s commercial loans and is primarily dedicated
to the reduction of the Webster Credit Line (see Note 8).  

4. COMMERCIAL
LOANS  

Short
Term Loans Receivable   

The
Company offers short-term secured non banking loans to real estate investors (also known as hard money) to fund their acquisition
and construction of properties located in the New York Metropolitan area. The loans are principally secured by collateral consisting
of real estate and, generally, accompanied by personal guarantees from the principals of the businesses. The loans are generally
for a term of one year. The short term loans are initially recorded, and carried thereafter, in the financial statements at cost.
Most of the loans provide for receipt of interest only during the term of the loan and a balloon payment at the end of the term.  

At
September 30, 2016, we were committed to an additional $4,595,000 in construction loans that can be drawn by the borrower when
certain conditions are met.  

At
September 30, 2016, no one entity has loans outstanding representing more than 10% of the total balance of the loans outstanding.  

The
Company generally grants loans for a term of one year. When a performing loan reaches its maturity and the borrower requests an
extension we may extend the term of the loan beyond one year and reclassify it as part of long term loans receivable. Prior to
granting an extension of any loan, we reevaluate the underlying collateral.  

Long
Term Loans Receivable   

Long
term loans receivable is comprised of the loans that were extended beyond the original maturity dates, unless it is clear that
the loan will be paid back by September 30, 2017. At September 30, 2016, the Company s loan portfolio consists of $23,314,500
short term loans receivable and $8,217,320 long term loans receivable.  

Credit
Risk   

Credit
risk profile based on loan activity as of September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

At
September 30, 2016, the Company s long term loans receivable includes loans in the amount of $225,000, $725,000 and $3,197,320
originally due in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. In all instances the borrowers are currently paying their interest and, generally,
the Company receives a fee in connection with the extension of the loans. Accordingly, at September 30, 2016, no loan impairments
exist and there are no provisions for impairments of loans or recoveries thereof included in operations. Subsequent to September
30, 2016, $1,867,500 of the Company s long term loans receivable were paid off.  

5.  Investment
in Privately Held Company   

The
Company had an original investment in a privately held Israeli-based company in the amount of $100,000. The privately held company
offers surgeons and radiologists the ability to detect cancer in real time. Due to the fact that the privately held company has
experienced delays in executing its business plan, the Company determined to write down the value of its investment to $65,000
at December 31, 2013 and to $50,000 at June 30, 2015. The Company further wrote down the value of its investment to $40,000 at
June 30, 2016, resulting in a charge to the statement of operations of $10,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016.  

6. EARNINGS
PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK  

Basic
and diluted earnings per share are calculated in accordance with ASC 260  Earnings Per Share . Under ASC 260, basic
earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding for the period. The computation of diluted earnings per share is similar to basic earnings per share, except that
the denominator is increased to include the potential dilution from the exercise of stock options and warrants for common shares
using the treasury stock method. The numerator in calculating both basic and diluted earnings per common share for each period
is the reported net income.  

The
denominator is based on the following weighted average number of common shares:  

For
the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, 47,309 and 53,940, exercisable stock options and warrants were not
included in the diluted earnings per share calculation, respectively, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.  

For
the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015, 103,745 and 103,951, exercisable stock options and warrants were not
included in the diluted earnings per share calculation, respectively, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.  

7. STOCK
  BASED COMPENSATION  

The
Company measures and recognizes compensation awards for all stock option grants made to employees and directors, based on their
fair value in accordance with ASC 718  Compensation - Stock Compensation , which establishes standards for the accounting
for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. A key provision of this statement
is to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments (including stock options)
based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The cost will be recognized over the service period during which an employee
is required to provide service in exchange for the award (i.e., the requisite service period or vesting period). The Company accounts
for equity instruments issued to non-employees in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718 and ASC 505-50,  Equity Based
Payment to Non-Employees . All transactions with non-employees, in which goods or services are the consideration received
for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value
of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more appropriately measurable.  

The
share based compensation expense includes the amortization of the fair value of 1,000,000 restricted shares granted to the Company s
CEO, Assaf Ran, on September 9, 2011 of $195,968, after adjusting for the effect on the fair value of the stock options related
to this transaction. The fair value will be amortized over 15 years.  

Share
based compensation expense recognized under ASC 718 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $3,397 and $10,192,
respectively. Share based compensation expense recognized under ASC 718 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015
were $3,416 and $10,248, respectively.  

The
exercise price of options granted under the Company s stock option plan (the  Plan ) may not be less than the
fair market value on the date of grant. Stock options under the Plan may be awarded to officers, key-employees, consultants and
non-employee directors of the Company. Historically, until the year ended December 31, 2014, each non-employee director of the
Company was granted an option for 7,000 common shares upon first taking office, and received an annual option grant for an additional
7,000 common shares for each additional year in office. Generally, options outstanding vest over periods not exceeding four years
and are exercisable for up to five years from the grant date.  

The
objectives of the Plan include attracting and retaining key personnel, providing for additional performance incentives and promoting
the success of the Company by increasing the efforts of such officers, employees, consultants and directors. The Plan is the only
plan that the Company has adopted with stock options available for grant.  

The
following summarizes the Company s stock option activity for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016:  

On
July 31, 2014, in connection with the Company s public offering in July 2014, the Company issued warrants to purchase up
to 87,719 common shares, with an exercise price of $3.5625 per common share, to the representative of the underwriters of the
offering (the  July 2014 Rep Warrants ). These warrants are exercisable at any time, and from time to time, in whole
or in part, commencing on July 28, 2015 and expire on July 28, 2019. The fair value of these warrants, using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model, on the date of issuance was $42,224. At September 30, 2016, July 2014 Rep Warrants to purchase up to 10,250
common shares were outstanding.  

On
May 29, 2015, in connection with the Company s public offering in May 2015, the Company issued warrants to purchase up to
50,750 common shares, with an exercise price of $5.4875 per common share, to the representative of the underwriters of the offering
(the  May 2015 Rep Warrants ). These warrants are exercisable at any time, and from time to time, in whole or in part,
commencing on May 22, 2016 and expire on May 22, 2020. The fair value of these warrants, using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model, on the date of issuance was $54,928. At September 30, 2016, May 2015 Rep Warrants to purchase up to 34,068 common shares
were outstanding.  

On
August 15, 2016, in connection with the Shelf Takedown (defined below), the Company issued warrants to purchase up to 33,612 common
shares, with an exercise price of $7.4375 per common share, to the representative of the underwriters of the offering (the  August
2016 Rep Warrants ). The warrants are exercisable at any time, and from time to time, in whole or in part, commencing on
August 9, 2017 and expire on August 9, 2021. The fair value of these warrants, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, on
the date of issuance was $47,020. At September 30, 2016, all of the August 2016 Rep Warrants were outstanding.  

8. LOANS
AND LINE OF CREDIT  

Short
Term Loans   

As
of April 2016, all of the Company s short-term loans were repaid in full.  

Line
of Credit   

On
February 27, 2015, the Company entered into a Line of Credit Agreement with Webster Business Credit Corporation ( Webster )
pursuant to which it may borrow up to $14 million until February 27, 2018 (the  Webster Credit Line ) against assignments
of mortgages and other collateral. The Webster Credit Line provides for an interest rate of either LIBOR plus 4.75% or the base
commercial lending rate of Webster plus 3.25% as chosen by the Company for each drawdown. The Webster Credit Line contains various
covenants and restrictions including, among other covenants and restrictions, limiting the amount that the Company can borrow
relative to the value of the underlying collateral, maintaining various financial ratios and limitations on the terms of loans
the Company makes to its customers, limiting the Company s ability to pay dividends under certain circumstances, and limiting
the Company s ability to repurchase its common shares, sell assets, engage in mergers or consolidations, grant liens, and
enter into transactions with affiliates. Mr. Ran has personally guaranteed all of the Company s obligations to Webster.
Total costs to establish the Webster Credit Line were approximately $144,000. These costs are being amortized over three years,
using the straight-line method. The amortization costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $36,124 and
$27,501, respectively.  

The
Webster Credit Line replaced the $7.7 million credit facility (the  Sterling Credit Line ) with Sterling National
Bank ( Sterling ). The Company paid off the entire balance due to Sterling with proceeds from the Webster Credit Line
and terminated the Sterling Credit Line on February 27, 2015. In addition, the Company utilized the Webster Credit Line to repay
in full loans from Mr. Ran in the aggregate amount of $1,100,000, as well as two short-term loans, outstanding at December 31,
2014, in the aggregate amount of $1,000,000, which bore interest at the rate of 12% per annum. At September 30, 2016, the outstanding
amount under the Webster Credit Line was $4,263,055. The interest rate on the amount outstanding fluctuates daily. The rate for
September 30, 2016 was 5.27438%.  

9. PUBLIC
OFFERINGS  

On
April 25, 2016, MBC Funding II completed a firm commitment underwritten public offering of 6% senior secured notes due April 22,
2026 (the  Notes ). The Company guaranteed MBC Funding II s obligations under the Notes, which are secured by
a pledge by the Company of 100% of the outstanding common shares of MBC Funding II it owns. The gross proceeds to MBC Funding
II from this offering were $6,000,000, and the net proceeds were approximately $5,200,000, after deducting the underwriting discounts
and commissions and other offering expenses. MBC Funding II utilized the proceeds to purchase a pool of mortgage loans from MBC,
which the Company in turn used to pay down the Webster Credit Line (see Note 8).  

On
August 15, 2016, the Company completed a public offering of 672,269 common shares at an offering price of $5.95 per share (the
 Shelf Takedown ). The gross proceeds raised by the Company from the Shelf Takedown were approximately $4,600,000
(including approximately $600,000 from the sale of 100,840 additional common shares upon the exercise of the over-allotment option
by the underwriter) before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses. The total net
proceeds from the Shelf Takedown were approximately $4,200,000.

                                         AND CONTINGENCIES  

Operating
Lease    

On
June 9, 2011, the Company entered into a new lease agreement (the  Lease ) to relocate its corporate headquarters
to 60 Cutter Mill Road, Great Neck, New York. The Lease was for a term of five years and two months commencing June 2011 and ending

five-years, through September 30, 2021. Among other things, the Lease Amendment provides for gradual rent increases annually from
approximately $3,500 per month during the first year to $3,900 per month during the fifth year of the extension term.  

Item
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our
unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The discussion and
analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results
and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from those projected in such forward-looking statements .

We
are a New York-based real estate finance company that specializes in originating, servicing and managing a portfolio of first
mortgage loans. We offer short-term, secured, non-banking loans (sometimes referred to as  hard money  loans), which
we may renew or extend on, before or after their initial term expires, to real estate investors to fund their acquisition, renovation,
rehabilitation or development of residential or commercial properties located in the New York metropolitan area. We are organized
and conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. We elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with
our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our shareholders
on an annual basis.  

The
properties securing our loans are generally classified as residential or commercial real estate and, typically, are held for resale
or investment and typically, are not income producing. Each loan is secured by a first mortgage lien on real estate. In addition,
each loan is personally guaranteed by the principal(s) of the borrower guaranty, which guaranty may be collaterally secured by
a pledge of the guarantor s interest in the borrower. The face amounts of the loans we originate historically have ranged
from $14,000 to a maximum of $1,475,000. Our Board established a policy limiting the maximum amount of any loan to the lower of
(i) 9.9% of the aggregate amount of our loan portfolio (not including the loan under consideration) and (ii) $2 million. Our loans
typically have a maximum initial term of 12 months and bear interest at a fixed rate of 12% to 14% per year. In addition, we usually
receive origination fees, or  points,  ranging from 0% to 3% of the original principal amount of the loan as well
as other fees relating to underwriting, funding and managing the loan. Interest is always payable monthly, in arrears. In the
case of acquisition financing, the principal amount of the loan usually does not exceed 75% of the value of the property (as determined
by an independent appraiser), and in the case of construction financing, up to 80% of construction costs.  

Since
commencing this business in 2007, we have made over 470 loans, have never foreclosed on a property and none of our loans have
ever gone into default although sometimes we have renewed or extended our loans to enable the borrower to avoid premature sale
or refinancing of the property. When we renew or extend a loan we receive additional  points  and other fees.  

Our
primary business objective is to grow our loan portfolio while protecting and preserving capital in a manner that provides for
attractive risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders over the long term through dividends. We intend to achieve this objective
by continuing to selectively originate loans and carefully manage our portfolio of first mortgage real estate loans in a manner
designed to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns across a variety of market conditions and economic cycles. We believe that
the demand for relatively small loans secured by residential and commercial real estate held for investment in the New York metropolitan
market is significant and growing and that traditional lenders, including banks and other financial institutions, that usually
address this market are unable to satisfy this demand. This demand/supply imbalance has created an opportunity for non-bank  hard
money  real estate lenders like us to selectively originate high-quality first mortgage loans on attractive terms and that
this condition should persist for a number of years. We have built our business on a foundation of intimate knowledge of the New
York metropolitan area real estate market combined with a disciplined credit and due diligence culture that is designed to protect
and preserve capital. We believe that our flexibility in terms of meeting the needs of borrowers without compromising our standards
on credit risk, our expertise, our intimate knowledge of the New York metropolitan area real estate market and our focus on newly
originated first mortgage loans, has defined our success until now and should enable us to continue to achieve our objectives.  

A
principal source of new transactions has been repeat business from prior customers and their referral of new business. We also
receive leads for new business from banks, brokers and a limited amount of newspaper advertising and direct mail. Finally, our
chief executive officer also spends a significant portion of his time on new business development. We rely on our own employees,
independent legal counsel, and other independent professionals to verify titles and ownership, to file liens and to consummate
the transactions. Outside appraisers are used to assist us in evaluating the worth of collateral, when deemed necessary by management.  

For
the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the total amounts of $24,299,500 and $15,346,500 have been lent, respectively,
offset by collections received from borrowers, under our commercial loans in the amount of $23,671,720 and $10,234,936, respectively.  

At
September 30, 2016, we were committed to an additional $4,595,000 in construction loans that can be drawn by the borrower when
certain conditions are met.  

In
July 2014, we completed a public offering of 1,754,386 common shares. The gross proceeds from the offering were $5.0 million and
the net proceeds were approximately $4.3 million, after deducting our underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.
As a result of this offering, we satisfied all of the requirements to be taxed as a REIT. We elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing
with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT and avoid any excise tax on our
net taxable income, we are required to distribute each year at least 90% of our taxable income. If we distribute less than 100%
of our taxable income (but more than 90%), the undistributed portion will be taxed at the regular corporate income tax rates.
As a REIT, we may also be subject to federal excise taxes and minimum state taxes.  

On
February 27, 2015, we repaid and terminated our Sterling Credit Line, as described in  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
below, and replaced it with the Webster Credit Line, as described in  Liquidity and Capital Resources  below, pursuant
to which we may borrow up to $14 million during the next three years. The Webster Credit Line provides for an interest rate of
either LIBOR plus 4.75% or Webster s base commercial lending rate plus 3.25%, as chosen by us for each drawdown, and expires
on February 27, 2018. The Webster Credit Line is secured by assignment of mortgages and other collateral and is guaranteed by
Assaf Ran, our chief executive officer.  

On
May 29, 2015, we completed another public offering of 1,015,000 common shares. In June 2015, the underwriter partially exercised
its over-allotment option for an additional 105,000 common shares. The gross proceeds from the offering, including the partial
exercise of the over-allotment option, were approximately $4.9 million and the net proceeds were approximately $4.2 million, after
deducting our underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.  

On
April 25, 2016, MBC Funding II Corp., a New York corporation ( MBC Funding II ), our wholly owned subsidiary, completed
a firm commitment underwritten public offering of 6% senior secured notes due April 22, 2026 (the  Notes ). We guaranteed
MBC Funding II s obligations under the Notes, which are secured by our pledge of 100% of the outstanding common shares of
MBC Funding II we own. The gross proceeds to MBC Funding II from this offering were $6.0 million, and the net proceeds were approximately
$5.2 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. MBC Funding II utilized
the proceeds to purchase a pool of mortgage loans from us, which we in turn used to pay down the Webster Credit Line.  

On
August 15, 2016, we completed another public offering of 672,269 common shares. In addition, the underwriter fully exercised its
over-allotment option for an additional 100,840 common shares. The gross proceeds from the offering, including the exercise of
the over-allotment option, were approximately $4.6 million and the net proceeds were approximately $4.2 million, after deducting
our underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.  

To
date, we have not experienced any defaults and none of the loans previously made have been non-collectable, although no assurances
can be given that existing or future loans may not go into default or prove to be non-collectible in the future.

of Operations   

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   

Revenue  

Total
revenues for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $1,169,000 compared to approximately $1,032,000
for the three month period ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $137,000, or 13.3%. The increase in revenue represents an
increase in lending operations. For the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, approximately $960,000 and $871,000,
respectively, of our revenues were attributable to interest income on the secured commercial loans that we offer to small businesses,
and approximately $209,000 and $160,000, respectively, of our revenues were attributable to origination fees on such loans. Our
loans are principally secured by collateral consisting of real property and, generally, accompanied by personal guarantees.  

Interest
and amortization of debt service costs  

Interest
and amortization of debt service costs for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $205,000 compared
to approximately $160,000 for the three month period ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $45,000, or 28.1%. The increase
in interest and amortization of debt service costs was primarily attributable to the issuance of the Notes (See Note 9 to the
financial statements included elsewhere in this report).  

General
and administrative expenses  

General
and administrative expenses for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $237,000 compared to approximately
$230,000 for the three month period ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $7,000, or 3.0%. The increase is primarily attributable
to an increase in payroll expenses, offset by a decrease in consulting fees.  

Net
income  

Net
income for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $725,000 compared to approximately $639,000 for the
three month period ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $86,000, or 13.5%. The increase is primarily attributable to the increase
in revenue, offset by the increase in interest and amortization of debt service costs.  

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   

Revenue  

Total
revenues for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $3,440,000 compared to approximately $2,855,000
for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $585,000, or 20.5%. The increase in revenue represents an increase
in lending operations. For the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, revenues of approximately $2,849,000 and
$2,392,000, respectively, were attributable to interest income on the secured commercial loans that we offer to small businesses,
and approximately $591,000 and $463,000, respectively, were attributable to origination fees on such loans. Our loans are principally
secured by collateral consisting of real property and, generally, accompanied by personal guarantees.  

Interest
and amortization of debt service costs  

Interest
and amortization of debt service costs for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $594,000 compared
to approximately $494,000 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $100,000, or 20.2%. The increase
in interest and amortization of debt service costs was primarily attributable to the establishment and use of the Webster Credit
Line, and the issuance of the Notes (See Notes 8 and 9 to the financial statements included elsewhere in this report) in order
to increase our ability to make loans.  

General
and administrative expenses  

General
and administrative expenses for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $698,000 compared to approximately
$696,000 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $2,000. The increase is primarily attributable to
increases in bank fees and legal fees, offset by a decrease in consulting fees.  

Write-down
of investment in privately held company  

Write-down
of investment in privately held company for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $10,000 and $15,000,
respectively. We wrote down the value of our investment in a privately held company due to the fact that it has experienced delays
in executing its business plan. (See Note 5 to the financial statements included elsewhere in this report).  

Net
Income  

Net
income for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $2,130,000 compared to approximately $1,645,000 for
the nine month period ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $485,000, or 29.5%. The increase is primarily attributable to the
increase in revenue, offset by the increase in interest and amortization of debt service costs.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

At
September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $159,000 and working capital of approximately $20,067,000
as compared to cash and cash equivalents of approximately $107,000 and working capital of $6,808,000 at December 31, 2015. The
increase in working capital is primarily attributable to decreases in the line of credit and short term loans, mainly resulting
from the issuance of the Notes and the proceeds from the August 2016 public stock offering (as described above), and no dividends
accrual at September 30, 2016.  

For
the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net cash provided by operating activities were approximately $2,303,000
and $1,497,000, respectively. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities primarily results from increases in net
income and in deferred origination fees, and a decrease in interest receivable on loans.  

Net
cash used in investing activities for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $631,000 as compared to
approximately $5,115,000 for the period ended September 30, 2015. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine month period
ended September 30, 2016 consisted of the issuance of our short term commercial loans in the amount of approximately $24,300,000
and the purchase of fixed assets of approximately $3,000, offset by collection of these loans in the amount of approximately $23,672,000.
In the period ended September 30, 2015 net cash used in investing activities consisted of the issuance of our short term commercial
loans in the amount of approximately $15,347,000 and the purchase of fixed assets of approximately $3,000, offset by collection
of these loans in the amount of approximately $10,235,000.  

Net
cash used in financing activities for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $1,620,000 as compared
to approximately $3,632,000 provided by financing activities for the period ended September 30, 2015. Net cash used in financing
activities for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 reflects the repayments of the line of credit and short term loans
in the net amount of approximately $8,654,000, cash restricted for reduction of line of credit of approximately $919,000 and the
dividend payment of approximately $1,892,000, offset by the net proceeds from the public offerings of approximately $9,539,000
(including pertinent expenses of approximately $60,000 paid during 2015) and the proceeds from the exercise of warrants of approximately
$305,000. In the period ended September 30, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities reflects the net proceeds from the
public offering of approximately $4,237,000, the proceeds from lines of credit and short-term loans in the net amount of approximately
$1,024,000 and the proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants of approximately $33,000, offset by the dividend payment
of approximately $1,551,000, and the deferred financing costs on the establishment of the Webster Credit Line (as described below)
in the amount of approximately $111,000.  

On
February 27, 2015, we entered into a Credit and Security Agreement with Webster Business Credit Corporation ( Webster )
pursuant to which we may borrow up to $14 million until February 27, 2018 (the  Webster Credit Line ) against assignments
of mortgages and other collateral. The Webster Credit Line provides for an interest rate of either LIBOR plus 4.75% or the base
commercial lending rate of Webster plus 3.25% as chosen by us for each drawdown. The Webster Credit Line contains various covenants
and restrictions, including limiting the amount that we can borrow relative to the value of the underlying collateral, maintaining
various financial ratios and limitations on the terms of loans we make to our customers. Mr. Ran, has personally guaranteed all
of our obligations to Webster.  

The
Webster Credit Line replaced the $7.7 million credit facility (the  Sterling Credit Line ) with Sterling National
Bank ( Sterling ). We paid off the entire balance due to Sterling with proceeds from the Webster Credit Line and terminated
the Sterling Credit Line on February 27, 2015. In addition, we utilized the Webster Credit Line to repay in full loans from Mr.
Ran in the aggregate amount of $1,100,000, as well as two short-term loans, outstanding at December 31, 2014, in the aggregate
amount of $1,000,000, bearing interest at the rate of 12% per annum. At September 30, 2016, the outstanding amount under the Webster
Credit Line was $4,263,055 and the interest rate was 5.27438%. The interest rate on the amount outstanding fluctuates daily.  

Until
our initial public offering in 1999, our principal source of funds was cash flow from operations, which funded both our working
capital needs and capital expenditures. In May 1999 we completed our initial public offering in which we raised net proceeds of
approximately $6.4 million.  

In
July 2014, we completed a public offering of 1,754,386 common shares, which raised gross proceeds of $5.0 million and the net
proceeds of approximately $4.3 million, after deducting our underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. As a
result of this offering, we satisfied all of the requirements to be taxed as a REIT and elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing
with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014.  

In
order to maintain our qualification as a REIT and avoid any excise tax on our net taxable income, we are required to distribute
each year at least 90% of our taxable income. If we distribute less than 100% of our taxable income (but more than 90%), the undistributed
portion will be taxed at the regular corporate income tax rates. As a REIT, we may also be subject to federal excise taxes and
minimum state taxes.  

On
May 29, 2015, we completed another public offering of 1,015,000 common shares. In June 2015, the underwriter partially exercised
its over-allotment option for an additional 105,000 common shares. The gross proceeds from the offering, including the partial
exercise of the over-allotment option, were approximately $4.9 million and the net proceeds were approximately $4.2 million, after
deducting our underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.  

On
April 25, 2016, MBC Funding II completed an underwritten public offering of the Notes. We guaranteed MBC Funding II s obligations
under the Notes, which are secured by our pledge of 100% of the outstanding common shares of MBC Funding II we own. The gross
proceeds to MBC Funding II from this offering were $6.0 million, and the net proceeds were approximately $5.2 million, after deducting
the underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. MBC Funding II utilized the proceeds to purchase a pool
of mortgage loans from us, which we in turn used to pay down the Webster Credit Line.  

On
August 15, 2016, we completed another public offering of 672,269 common shares. In addition, the underwriter fully exercised its
over-allotment option for an additional 100,840 common shares. The gross proceeds from the offering, including the exercise of
the over-allotment option, were approximately $4.6 million and the net proceeds were approximately $4.2 million, after deducting
our underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.  

We
anticipate that our current cash balances and the Webster Credit Line, as described above, together with our cash flows from operations
will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next 12 months. However, we expect our working capital requirements to increase
over the next 12 months as we continue to strive for growth.

a)  
      Designed
    such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,

    us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;   

b)  
      Designed
    such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under

    affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting;
    and

The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control
over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors
(or persons performing the equivalent functions):  

a)  
      All
    significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
    are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
    information; and   

b)  
      Any
    fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s
    internal control over financial reporting.
