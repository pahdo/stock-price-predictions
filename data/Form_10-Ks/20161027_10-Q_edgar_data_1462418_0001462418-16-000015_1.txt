  NOTE 1       ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
  Description of Business 
  Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A., together with its subsidiaries (which may be referred to as  Altisource,  the  Company,   we,   us  or  our ), is a premier marketplace and transaction solutions provider for the real estate, mortgage and consumer debt industries.  Altisource s proprietary business processes, vendor and electronic payment management software and behavioral science-based analytics improve outcomes for marketplace participants. 
  We were formed under the laws of Luxembourg and are publicly traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol  ASPS.  
  We conduct our operations through   three   reportable segments: Mortgage Services, Financial Services and Technology Services.  In addition, we report our corporate related expenditures and eliminations separately (see   Note 23   for a description of our business segments). 
  Basis of Accounting and Presentation 
  The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, these financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete consolidated financial statements.  In the opinion of management, the interim data includes all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary to fairly state the results for the interim periods presented.  The preparation of interim condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our interim condensed consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. 
  Altisource consolidates two cooperative entities which are managed by The Mortgage Partnership of America, L.L.C. ( MPA ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Altisource: Best Partners Mortgage Cooperative, Inc., a mortgage cooperative doing business as Lenders One        ( Lenders One ) and Best Partners Mortgage Brokers Cooperative, Inc., a mortgage cooperative doing business as Wholesale One        ( Wholesale One ).  MPA provides services to Lenders One under a management agreement that ends on December 31, 2025 (with renewals for three successive five-year periods at MPA s option) and to Wholesale One under a management agreement that ends on July 8, 2039 (with automatic renewals for three successive five-year periods). 
  The management agreements between MPA and Lenders One and between MPA and Wholesale One, pursuant to which MPA is the management company, represent variable interests in variable interest entities.  MPA is the primary beneficiary of Lenders One and Wholesale One as it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact each of these cooperatives  economic performance and the right to receive benefits from each of these cooperatives.  As a result, Lenders One and Wholesale One are presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements on a consolidated basis and the interests of the members are reflected as non-controlling interests.  As of   September 30, 2016  , Lenders One had total assets of   $4.0 million   and total liabilities of   $1.9 million  .  As of   December 31, 2015  , Lenders One had total assets of   $4.9 million   and total liabilities of   $3.7 million  .  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , Wholesale One had less than   $0.1 million   in total assets and less than   $0.1 million   in total liabilities. 
  These interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as filed with the SEC on March 15, 2016.

Fair Value Measurements 
  Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  The three-tier hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value, which prioritizes the inputs used in the methodologies of measuring fair value for assets and liabilities, is as follows: 
  Level 1       Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities 
  Level 2       Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 
  Level 3       Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of assets or liabilities. 
  Financial assets and financial liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements.  Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities being measured and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. 
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement 
  On January 1, 2016, Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-03,   Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,   became effective.  As a result of this accounting change, the Company now presents debt issuance costs, net as a direct deduction from the related debt (see   Note 12  ).  Prior to January 1, 2016, debt issuance costs, net were included in other assets.  We adopted the standard retrospectively.  Accordingly, prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to the current presentation. 
  Future Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  .  This standard establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance.  The core principle of this standard is an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  This standard will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.  Early adoption is permitted, although not prior to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance may have on its results of operations and financial position. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  .  This standard will require equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  The standard also simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment.  When a qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists, an entity is required to measure the investment at fair value.  It also amends certain financial statement presentation and disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments.  This standard will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 31, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.  Early adoption is not permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance may have on its results of operations and financial position. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  .  This standard introduces a new lessee model that brings substantially all leases on the balance sheet.  The standard will require companies to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on their balance sheets and disclose key information about leasing arrangements in their financial statements.  This standard will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period.  Early application of this standard is permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance may have on its results of operations and financial position. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  .  This standard clarifies guidance on principal versus agent considerations in connection with revenue recognition.  When another party is involved in providing goods or services to a customer, an entity is required to determine whether the nature of its promise is to provide the specified good or service itself (that is, the entity is a principal) or to arrange for that good or service to be provided by the other party (that is, the entity is an agent).  An entity is a principal if it controls the specified good or service before that good or service is transferred to a customer.  The guidance includes indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customer.  This standard will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting

period.  Early adoption is permitted, although not prior to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance may have on its results of operations and financial position. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  .  This standard simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The standard will require companies to recognize all award-related excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in their income statements, classify any excess tax benefits as an operating activity in their statements of cash flows, provide companies with the option of estimating forfeitures or recognizing forfeitures as they occur, modify the statutory tax withholding requirements and classify cash paid by employers when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes as an investing activity in their statements of cash flows.  This standard will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period.  Early application of this standard is permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance may have on its results of operations and financial position. 
  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  .  This standard provides guidance on identifying performance obligations in a contract with a customer and clarifying several licensing considerations, including whether an entity s promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied at a point in time) or a right to access the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied over time) and guidance on sales-based and usage-based royalties.  This standard will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.  Early adoption is permitted, although not prior to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance may have on its results of operations and financial position. 
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  .  This standard addresses collectability, sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers, non-cash consideration, contract modifications at transition and completed contracts at transition.  This standard will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.  Early adoption is permitted, although not prior to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance may have on its results of operations and financial position. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  .  This standard addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice.  This standard will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.  Early adoption of this standard is permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance may have on its statement of cash flows. 
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16,   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.    This standard will require that companies recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset (other than inventory) when the transfer occurs.  Current guidance prohibits companies from recognizing current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party.  This standard will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.  Early adoption of this standard is permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance may have on its results of operations and financial position. 

NOTE 2       CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION 
  Ocwen Financial Corporation together with its subsidiaries ( Ocwen ) is our largest customer.  Ocwen purchases certain mortgage services and technology services from us under the terms of master services agreements and amendments thereto (collectively, the  Service Agreements ) with terms extending through August 2025.  Certain of the Service Agreements, among other things, contain a  most favored nation  provision and the parties to the Service Agreements have the right to renegotiate pricing.  Certain of the Service Agreements also prohibit Ocwen from establishing fee-based businesses that would directly or indirectly compete with Altisource s services with respect to the Homeward Residential, Inc. and Residential Capital, LLC servicing portfolios acquired by Ocwen in December 2012 and February 2013, respectively.  In addition, Ocwen purchases certain origination services from Altisource under an agreement that extends through January 2017.

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (  Continued  ) 

Revenue from Ocwen primarily consists of revenue earned directly from Ocwen and revenue earned from the loans serviced by Ocwen when Ocwen designates us as the service provider.  Revenue from Ocwen as a percentage of segment and consolidated revenue was as follows: 

For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we generated revenue from Ocwen of   $422.2 million   and   $464.8 million  , respectively (  $141.6 million   and   $163.8 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016   and   2015  , respectively).  Services provided to Ocwen during such periods and reported in the Mortgage Services segment included real estate asset management and sales, residential property valuation, trustee management services, property inspection and preservation services and insurance services.  Services provided to Ocwen and reported in the Financial Services segment included mortgage charge-off collections.  Services provided to Ocwen and reported in the Technology Services segment included information technology infrastructure management and software applications.  As of   September 30, 2016  , accounts receivable from Ocwen totaled   $32.6 million  ,   $21.8 million   of which was billed and   $10.8 million   of which was unbilled.  As of   December 31, 2015  , accounts receivable from Ocwen totaled   $38.2 million  ,   $20.4 million   of which was billed and   $17.8 million   of which was unbilled. 
  We earn additional revenue related to the portfolios serviced by Ocwen when a party other than Ocwen selects Altisource as the service provider.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recognized revenue of   $146.0 million   and   $164.7 million  , respectively (  $48.0 million   and   $56.7 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016   and   2015  , respectively), related to the portfolios serviced by Ocwen when a party other than Ocwen selected Altisource as the service provider.  These amounts are not included in deriving revenue from Ocwen as a percentage of revenue in the table above. 
   
  NOTE 3       TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES 
  Through January 16, 2015, William C. Erbey served as our Chairman as well as the Executive Chairman of Ocwen and Chairman of each of Home Loan Servicing Solutions, Ltd. ( HLSS ), Altisource Residential Corporation ( Residential ) and Altisource Asset Management Corporation ( AAMC ).  Effective January 16, 2015, Mr. Erbey stepped down as the Executive Chairman of Ocwen and Chairman of each of Altisource, HLSS, Residential and AAMC and is no longer a member of the Board of Directors of any of these companies.  Consequently, these companies are no longer related parties of Altisource, as defined by FASB ASC Topic 850,   Related Party Disclosures  .  The disclosures in this note are limited to the periods that each of Ocwen, HLSS, Residential and AAMC were related parties of Altisource and are not necessarily reflective of current activities with these former related parties. 
  Ocwen 
  Revenue 
  For the period from January 1, 2015 through January 16, 2015, we estimated that we generated revenue from Ocwen of   $22.9 million  .  Services provided to Ocwen during such period included real estate asset management and sales, residential property valuation, trustee management services, property inspection and preservation, insurance services, charge-off mortgage collections, information technology infrastructure management and software applications. 
  We record revenue we earn from Ocwen under the Service Agreements at rates we believe to be comparable market rates as we believe they are consistent with the fees we charge to other customers and/or fees charged by our competitors for comparable services. 
  Cost of Revenue and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
  At times, we have used Ocwen s contractors and/or employees to support Altisource related services.  Ocwen generally billed us for these contractors and/or employees based on their fully-allocated cost.  Additionally, through March 31, 2015, we purchased certain data relating to Ocwen s servicing portfolio in connection with a Data Access and Services Agreement.  Based upon our previously provided notice, the Data Access and Services Agreement was terminated effective March 31, 2015.  For the period from January 1, 2015 through January 16, 2015, we estimated that we incurred   $1.9 million   of expenses related to these items.

These amounts are reflected as a component of cost of revenue in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. 
  We provided certain other services to Ocwen and Ocwen provided certain other services to us in connection with Support Services Agreements.  These services primarily included such areas as vendor management, corporate services and facilities related services.  Billings for these services were generally based on the fully-allocated cost of providing the service based on an estimate of the time and expense of providing the service or estimates thereof.  Of the January 2015 billings to Ocwen, we estimated that   $0.1 million   related to the period from January 1, 2015 through January 16, 2015.  Of the January 2015 billings from Ocwen, we estimated that   $0.3 million   related to the period from January 1, 2015 through January 16, 2015.  These amounts are reflected as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. 
  HLSS 
  Prior to April 2015, HLSS was a publicly traded company whose primary objective was the acquisition of mortgage servicing rights and related servicing advances, loans held for investment and other residential mortgage related assets.  We provided HLSS certain finance, human resources, tax and facilities services and sold information technology services to HLSS under a support services agreement.  For the period from January 1, 2015 through January 16, 2015, our billings to HLSS were immaterial. 
  Residential and AAMC 
  Residential is focused on providing quality, affordable rental homes to families throughout the United States.  AAMC is an asset management company that provides portfolio management and corporate governance services to investment vehicles that own real estate related assets.  Its initial client is Residential. 
  We have agreements and amendments thereto, which extend through 2027, to provide Residential with renovation management, lease management, property management, real estate owned asset management, title insurance, settlement and valuation services.  In addition, we have agreements with Residential and AAMC pursuant to which we may provide services such as finance, human resources, facilities, technology and insurance risk management.  Further, we have separate agreements for certain services related to income tax matters, trademark licenses and technology products and services. 
  For the period from January 1, 2015 through January 16, 2015, we estimated that we generated revenue from Residential of   $1.0 million  .  This amount is reflected in revenue in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.  This excludes revenue from services we provide to Residential s loans serviced by Ocwen or other loan servicers where we were retained by Ocwen or Residential s other loan servicers. 
  For the period from January 1, 2015 through January 16, 2015, our billings to AAMC were immaterial. 
   
  NOTE 4         ACQUISITIONS 
  Granite Acquisition 
  On   July 29, 2016  , we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of   Granite Loan Management of Delaware, LLC   ( Granite ) for   $9.6 million   in cash at closing.  Granite provides residential and commercial loan disbursement processing, risk mitigation and construction inspection services to lenders.      The Granite acquisition is not material in relation to the Company s results of operations or financial position. 
  The preliminary allocation of the purchase price is as follows:

RentRange, Investability and Onit Solutions Acquisitions 
  On October 9, 2015, we acquired GoldenGator, LLC (doing business as RentRange       ) ( RentRange ), REIsmart, LLC (doing business as Investability       ) ( Investability ) and Onit Solutions, LLC, a support company for RentRange and Investability (collectively  RentRange and Investability ) for   $24.8 million  .  RentRange is a leading provider of rental home data and information to the financial services and real estate industries, delivering a wide assortment of address and geography level data, analytics and rent-based valuation solutions for single and multi-family properties.  Investability is an online residential real estate search and acquisition platform that utilizes data and analytics to allow real estate investors to access the estimated cash flow, capitalization rate, net yield and market value of properties for sale in the United States.  The purchase price was composed of   $17.5 million   in cash and   247 thousand   shares of restricted common stock of the Company with a value of   $7.3 million   as of the closing date.  Upon issuance, the restricted shares were subject to transfer restrictions and potential forfeiture provisions.  These restrictions and forfeiture provisions will lapse over a   four   year period, subject to the recipients meeting certain continued employment conditions with the Company and the satisfaction of certain acquisition related escrow release conditions.  During the third quarter of 2016, management adjusted the allocation of the purchase price based upon information that subsequently became available relating to acquisition date working capital and the purchase price allocation to intangible assets.  The working capital adjustment resulted in an obligation of the sellers to pay the Company   $0.2 million  .  RentRange and Investability are not material in relation to the Company s results of operations or financial position. 
  The initial and final allocation of the purchase price is as follows: 

CastleLine Acquisition 
  On July 17, 2015, we acquired CastleLine Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries ( CastleLine ) for   $33.4 million  .  CastleLine is a specialty risk management and insurance services firm that provides financial products and services to parties involved in the origination, underwriting, purchase and securitization of residential mortgages.  The purchase consideration was composed of   $12.3 million   of cash at closing,   $10.5 million   of cash payable over   four   years from the acquisition date and   495 thousand   shares of restricted common stock of the Company, that were subject to transfer restrictions, with a value of   $14.4 million   as of the closing date.  Of the cash payable following acquisition,   $3.8 million   is contingent on certain future employment conditions of certain of the sellers, and therefore excluded from the purchase price.  During the second quarter of 2016, management adjusted the allocation of the purchase price based upon information that subsequently became available relating to acquisition date working capital and the purchase price allocation to intangible assets.  The CastleLine acquisition is not material in relation to the Company s results of operations or financial position.

NOTE 5       AVAILABLE FOR SALE SECURITIES 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we purchased   4.1 million   shares of Residential common stock for   $48.2 million   (  no   comparative amount in the   third quarter   of   2016  ).  This investment is classified as available for sale and reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value at the balance sheet date (  $45.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016  ) (  no   comparative amount as of   December 31, 2015  ).  Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are reflected in other comprehensive income, unless there is an impairment that is other than temporary.  In the event that a decline in market value is other than temporary, we would record a charge to earnings and a new cost basis in the investment would be established.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we incurred expenses of   $3.4 million   and earned dividends of   $1.0 million   related to this investment (  no   comparative amounts in   2015  ).

NOTE 12       LONG-TERM DEBT 
  Long-term debt consists of the following: 

On November 27, 2012, Altisource Solutions S.  r.l., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A., entered into a senior secured term loan agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain lenders.  Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. and certain wholly-owned subsidiaries are guarantors of the term loan (collectively, the  Guarantors ).  We subsequently amended the senior secured term loan agreement to increase the principal amount of the senior secured term loan and, among other changes, re-establish the   $200.0 million   incremental term loan facility accordion, lower the interest rate, extend the maturity date by approximately one year and increase the maximum amount of Restricted Junior Payments (as defined in the senior secured term loan agreement; other capitalized terms, unless defined herein, are defined in the senior secured term loan agreement). 
  After giving effect to the third amendment entered into on August 1, 2014, the term loan must be repaid in equal consecutive quarterly principal installments of   $1.5 million  , which commenced on September 30, 2014, with the balance due at maturity.  All amounts outstanding under the senior secured term loan agreement will become due on the earlier of (i) December 9, 2020 and (ii) the date on which the loans are declared to be due and owing by the administrative agent at the request (or with the consent) of the Required Lenders or as otherwise provided in the senior secured term loan agreement upon the occurrence of any event of default under the senior secured term loan agreement. 
  In addition to the scheduled principal payments, subject to certain exceptions, the term loan is subject to mandatory prepayment upon issuances of debt, casualty and condemnation events and sales of assets, as well as from a percentage of Consolidated Excess Cash Flow if the leverage ratio is greater than   3.00   to   1.00  , as calculated in accordance with the provisions of the senior secured term loan agreement (the percentage increases if the leverage ratio exceeds   3.50   to   1.00  ).    No   mandatory prepayments were owed for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we repurchased portions of our senior secured term loan with an aggregate par value of   $51.0 million   at a weighted average discount of   13.2%  , recognizing a net gain of   $5.5 million   on the early extinguishment of debt (  no   repurchases in the   third quarter   of   2016  ).  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we repurchased portions of our senior secured term loan with an aggregate par value of   $27.0 million   at a weighted average discount of   9.8%  , recognizing a net gain of   $2.0 million   on the early extinguishment of debt (repurchased aggregate par value of   $11.0 million   at a weighted average discount of   11.0%  , recognizing a net gain of   $0.9 million   on the early extinguishment of debt for the third quarter of   2015  ).  The net gains were included in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. 
  The term loan bears interest at rates based upon, at our option, the   Adjusted Eurodollar Rate   or the   Base Rate  .    Adjusted Eurodollar Rate   loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of (i) the greater of (x) the   Adjusted Eurodollar Rate   for the applicable interest period and (y)   1.00%   plus (ii) a   3.50%   margin.    Base Rate   loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of (i) the greater of (x) the   Base Rate   and (y)   2.00%   plus (ii) a   2.50%   margin.  The interest rate at   September 30, 2016   was   4.50%  .

Term loan payments are guaranteed by the Guarantors and are secured by a pledge of all equity interests of certain subsidiaries as well as a lien on substantially all of the assets of Altisource Solutions S.  r.l. and the Guarantors, subject to certain exceptions. 
  The senior secured term loan agreement includes covenants that restrict or limit, among other things, our ability to: create liens and encumbrances; incur additional indebtedness; sell, transfer or dispose of assets; make Restricted Junior Payments including share repurchases, dividends and repayment of junior indebtedness; change lines of business; amend material debt agreements or other material contracts; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; enter into sale/leaseback transactions; grant negative pledges or agree to such other restrictions relating to subsidiary dividends and distributions; make changes to our fiscal year and engage in mergers and consolidations. 
  The senior secured term loan agreement contains certain events of default, including (i) failure to pay principal when due or interest or any other amount owing on any other obligation under the senior secured term loan agreement within   five   days of becoming due, (ii) material incorrectness of representations and warranties when made, (iii) breach of covenants, (iv) failure to pay principal or interest on any other debt that equals or exceeds   $40.0 million   when due, (v) default on any other debt that equals or exceeds   $40.0 million   that causes, or gives the holder or holders of such debt the ability to cause, an acceleration of such debt, (vi) occurrence of a Change of Control, (vii) bankruptcy and insolvency events, (viii) entry by a court of one or more judgments against us in an amount in excess of   $40.0 million   that remain unbonded, undischarged or unstayed for a certain number of days after the entry thereof, (ix) the occurrence of certain ERISA events and (x) the failure of certain Loan Documents to be in full force and effect.  If any event of default occurs and is not cured within applicable grace periods set forth in the senior secured term loan agreement or waived, all loans and other obligations could become due and immediately payable and the facility could be terminated. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , debt issuance costs were   $4.8 million  , net of   $5.5 million   of accumulated amortization.  As of   December 31, 2015  , debt issuance costs were   $6.2 million  , net of   $4.1 million   of accumulated amortization. 
  Interest expense on the term loans totaled   $18.5 million   and   $21.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively (  $6.0 million   and   $7.0 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016   and   2015  , respectively).

  Other non-current liabilities consist of the following: 

NOTE 14       FAIR VALUE 
  The following table presents the carrying amount and estimated fair value of financial instruments held by the Company as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  The following fair values are estimated using market information and what the Company believes to be appropriate valuation methodologies under GAAP are as follows:

     Table of Contents  
  ALTISOURCE PORTFOLIO SOLUTIONS S.A. 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (  Continued  ) 

Fair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis 
  Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are carried at amounts that approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments and were measured using Level 1 inputs. 
  Available for sale securities are carried at fair value and consist of   4.1 million   shares of Residential common stock.  Available for sale securities are measured using Level 1 inputs as these securities have quoted prices in active markets. 
  The fair value of our long-term debt is based on quoted market prices.  Based on the frequency of trading, we do not believe that there is an active market for our debt.  Therefore, the quoted prices are considered Level 2 inputs. 
  In accordance with ASC Topic 805,   Business Combinations  , liabilities for contingent consideration are reflected at fair value and adjusted each reporting period with the change in fair value recognized in earnings.  Liabilities for acquisition related contingent consideration were recorded in connection with the acquisitions of certain assets and assumption of certain liabilities of Mortgage Builder Software, Inc. and Owners Advantage, LLC in 2014.  We measure the liabilities for acquisition related contingent consideration using Level 3 inputs as they are determined based on the present value of future estimated payments, which include sensitivities pertaining to discount rates and financial projections. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we reached an agreement with the former owners of Equator, LLC ( Equator ) to extinguish any liability for the Equator related contingent consideration ( Equator Earn Out ) in exchange for   $0.5 million  .  In connection with this settlement, we reduced the liability for the Equator Earn Out to   $0   and recognized a   $7.6 million   reduction in operating expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. 
  There were no transfers between different levels during the periods presented. 
   
  NOTE 15       SHAREHOLDERS  EQUITY AND SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION 
  Stock Repurchase Plan 
  On   May 18, 2016  , our shareholders approved a new share repurchase program, which replaced the previous share repurchase program.  Under the new program, we are authorized to purchase up to   4.6 million   shares of our common stock, based on a limit of   25%   of the outstanding shares of common stock on the date of approval at a minimum price of   $1.00   per share and a maximum price of   $500.00   per share.  This is in addition to amounts previously purchased under prior programs.  Under the existing and prior programs, we purchased   1.3 million   shares of common stock at an average price of   $26.94   per share during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   1.8 million   shares at an average price of   $27.90   per share during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   (  0.5 million   shares at an average price of   $28.68   per share for the   third quarter   of   2016   and   0.2 million   shares at an average price of   $26.88   per share for the   third quarter   of   2015  ).  As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   4.0 million   shares of common stock remain available for repurchase under the new program.  Our senior secured term loan limits the amount we can spend on share repurchases and may prevent repurchases in certain circumstances.  As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $379 million   was available to repurchase our common stock under our senior secured term loan. 
  Share-Based Compensation 
  We issue share-based awards in the form of stock options and certain other equity-based awards for certain employees, officers and directors.  We recorded share-based compensation expense of   $4.7 million   and   $3.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively (  $1.1 million   and   $1.9 million   for the   third quarter   of 2016 and 2015, respectively).  As of   September 30, 2016  , estimated unrecognized compensation costs related to share-based awards amounted to   $7.3 million  , which we expect to recognize over a weighted average remaining requisite service period of approximately   2.23 years  . 
  Stock Options 
  Stock option grants are composed of a combination of service-based, market-based and performance-based options. 
  Service-Based Options.    These options generally vest over   three   or   four years   with equal annual cliff-vesting and expire on the earlier of   ten years   after the date of grant or following termination of service.  A total of   0.9 million   service-based awards were outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Market-Based Options  .  These option grants generally have   two   components, each of which vests only upon the achievement of certain criteria.  The first component, which we refer to internally as  ordinary performance  grants, consists of two-thirds of the market-based grant and begins to vest if the stock price is at least double the exercise price, as long as the stock price realizes a compounded annual gain of at least   20%   over the exercise price.  The remaining third of the market-based options,  
  
   18 

     Table of Contents  
  ALTISOURCE PORTFOLIO SOLUTIONS S.A. 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (  Continued  ) 

which we refer to internally as  extraordinary performance  grants, begins to vest if the stock price is at least triple the exercise price, as long as the stock price realizes a compounded annual gain of at least   25%   over the exercise price.  Market-based awards vest in three or four year installments with the first installment vesting upon the achievement of the criteria and the remaining installments vesting thereafter in annual installments.  Market-based options generally expire on the earlier of   ten years   after the date of grant or following termination of service, unless the performance criteria is met prior to termination of service or in the final   three years   of the option term, in which case vesting will generally continue in accordance with the provisions of the award agreement.  A total of   1.1 million   market-based awards were outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Performance-Based Options.   These option grants begin to vest upon the achievement of certain business unit specific financial measures. Generally,   25%   of the awards vest upon the achievement of the performance criteria and the remaining   75%   vest thereafter in three equal annual installments.  The award of performance-based options is adjusted based on the level of achievement specified in the award agreements.  If the performance criteria achieved is below a certain threshold, the award is cancelled.  The options expire on the earlier of   ten years   after the date of grant or following termination of service.  A total of   0.1 million   performance-based awards were outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . 
  The Company granted   0.1 million   stock options (at a weighted average exercise price of   $29.22   per share) and   0.7 million   stock options (at a weighted average exercise price of   $23.19   per share) during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  The fair values of the service-based and performance-based options were determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the fair value of the market-based options was determined using a lattice (binomial) model.  The following assumptions were used to determine the fair value as of the grant date: 

We determined the expected option life of all service-based stock option grants using the simplified method.  We use the simplified method because we believe that our historical data does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected option life. 
  The following table summarizes the weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted per share, the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised and the grant date fair value of stock options that vested during the period presented:

Other Share-Based Awards 
  The Company s other share-based and similar types of awards are composed of restricted shares and, through August 29, 2016, Equity Appreciation Rights ( EAR ). Effective August 29, 2016, the EAR plans were terminated. 
  The restricted shares are service-based awards that vest over   one   to   four   years with either annual cliff-vesting, vesting of all of the restricted shares at the end of the vesting period or vesting beginning after   two   years of service.  The Company granted   13 thousand   restricted shares (at a weighted average price of   $26.66   per share) during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  The following table summarizes the activity related to our restricted shares: 

Share-based compensation expense for stock options and restricted shares is recorded net of estimated forfeiture rates ranging from   0%   to   40%  . 
   
  NOTE 16       REVENUE 
  Revenue includes service revenue, reimbursable expenses and non-controlling interests.  Service revenue consists of amounts attributable to our fee-based services.  Reimbursable expenses and non-controlling interests are pass-through items for which we earn no margin.  Reimbursable expenses consist of amounts we incur on behalf of our customers in performing our fee-based services, but we pass such costs directly on to our customers without any additional markup.  Non-controlling interests represent the earnings of Lenders One and Wholesale One, consolidated entities not owned by Altisource, and are included in revenue and reduced from net income to arrive at net income attributable to Altisource (see   Note 1  ).  The components of revenue were as follows:

NOTE 19       LOSS ON HLSS EQUITY SECURITIES AND DIVIDENDS RECEIVED 
  During March 2015, we purchased   1.6 million   shares of HLSS common stock in the open market for   $30.0 million  .  This investment was classified as available for sale.  On April 6, 2015, HLSS completed the sale of substantially all of its assets to New Residential Investment Corp. (   NRZ   ) and adopted a plan of complete liquidation and dissolution.  During April 2015, we received liquidating dividends and other dividends from HLSS totaling   $20.4 million   and we sold all of our   1.6 million   shares of HLSS common stock in the open market for   $7.7 million  .  As a result of these transactions, we recognized a net loss of   $1.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   (  no   comparative amounts in   2016  ) in connection with our investment in HLSS.

NOTE 20       OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET 
  Other income (expense), net consists of the following: 

NOTE 21       EARNINGS PER SHARE 
  Basic earnings per share ( EPS ) is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted EPS reflects the assumed conversion of all dilutive securities using the treasury stock method. 
  Basic and diluted EPS are calculated as follows: 

For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   0.4 million   options and   0.6 million   options, respectively, that were anti-dilutive have been excluded from the computation of diluted EPS (  0.4 million   options and   0.4 million   options for the   third quarter   of   2016   and   2015  , respectively).  These options were anti-dilutive and excluded from the computation of diluted EPS because their exercise price was greater than the average market price of our common stock.  Also excluded from the computation of diluted EPS are   0.4 million   options and   0.3 million   options for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively (  0.4 million   and   0.3 million   options for the   third quarter   of   2016   and   2015  , respectively), granted for shares that begin to vest upon the achievement of certain market criteria related to our common stock price, performance criteria and an annualized rate of return to shareholders that have not yet been met. 
   
  NOTE 22       COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY MATTERS 
  Litigation 
  From time to time, we are involved in legal and administrative proceedings arising in the course of our business.  We record a liability for these matters if an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, including expected insurance coverage.  For proceedings where the reasonable estimate of loss is a range, we record a best estimate of loss within the range. 
  On September 8, 2014, the West Palm Beach Firefighters  Pension Fund filed a putative securities class action suit against Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. and certain of its current or former officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 with regard to disclosures concerning

     Table of Contents

pricing and transactions with related parties that allegedly inflated Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. share prices.  The Court subsequently appointed the Pension Fund for the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades District Council 35 and the Annuity Fund for the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades District Council 35 as Lead Plaintiffs.  On January 30, 2015, Lead Plaintiffs filed an amended class action complaint which added Ocwen Financial Corporation as a defendant, and seeks a determination that the action may be maintained as a class action on behalf of purchasers of Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. securities between April 25, 2013 and December 21, 2014 and an unspecified amount of damages.  Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. moved to dismiss the suit on March 23, 2015.  On September 4, 2015, the Court granted the defendants  motion to dismiss, finding that the Lead Plaintiffs  amended complaint failed to state a claim as to any of the defendants, but permitting the Lead Plaintiffs to file another amended complaint.  Lead Plaintiffs subsequently filed second and third amended complaints with substantially similar claims and theories.  Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. moved to dismiss the third amended complaint on October 22, 2015.  On December 22, 2015, the Court issued an order dismissing with prejudice all claims against Ocwen Financial Corporation and certain claims against Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. and the officer and director defendants, but denying the motion to dismiss as to other claims.  Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. intends to continue to vigorously defend this suit.    
  On February 11, 2015, W.A. Sokolowski, an alleged shareholder of Ocwen Financial Corporation, filed an amended shareholder derivative complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida against Ocwen Financial Corporation (as a nominal defendant), certain of its current or former officers and directors, Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. and other companies.  The suit seeks recovery of an unspecified amount of damages for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty by Ocwen Financial Corporation s officers and directors, which were allegedly aided and abetted by Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. and other defendants.  Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on November 9, 2015.  While that motion was pending, additional lawsuits alleging similar claims for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties by current or former Ocwen Financial Corporation officers and directors were filed in or transferred to the Court.  The Court subsequently consolidated these actions and denied Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. s motion to dismiss the Sokolowski complaint without prejudice to re-file following appointment of lead counsel for the consolidated action and the filing or designation of an operative complaint.  Lead counsel for plaintiffs filed their Consolidated Verified Shareholder Derivative Complaint (the  Consolidated Complaint ) on March 8, 2016.  The Consolidated Complaint alleges claims that Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A., its subsidiary Beltline Road Insurance Agency, Inc. and other defendants aided and abetted alleged breaches of fiduciary duties by Ocwen Financial Corporation officers and directors and/or were unjustly enriched in connection with business dealings with Ocwen Financial Corporation.  The Consolidated Complaint also seeks contribution from Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A., its subsidiary Beltline Road Insurance Agency, Inc. and other defendants for amounts Ocwen Financial Corporation paid in connection with a settlement with the New York State Department of Financial Services.  Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. and Beltline Road Insurance Agency, Inc. filed motions to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint on May 13, 2016 and intend to vigorously defend the lawsuit.  The Court disclosed that the parties reached a settlement in a settlement conference on October 13, 2016. The Court docket provides that a Stipulation of Settlement is due on or before November 18, 2016, and a Final Approval Hearing will be held before the Court on January 18, 2017.    
  On March 26, 2015, Robert Moncavage, an alleged shareholder of Ocwen Financial Corporation, filed an amended shareholder derivative complaint in the Circuit Court of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit in and for Palm Beach County, Florida against Ocwen Financial Corporation (as a nominal defendant), certain of its current or former officers and directors, Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. and other companies.  The suit seeks recovery of an unspecified amount of damages for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties by the current or former Ocwen Financial Corporation officers and directors, which were allegedly aided and abetted by Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. and other defendants.  On November 9, 2015, the Court entered an order staying all proceedings in the case pending further order of the Court.  If the litigation proceeds, Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit and to move to dismiss all claims against it.    
  Altisource is unable to predict the outcomes of these lawsuits or reasonably estimate the potential loss, if any, arising from the suits, given that the motion to dismiss in the second case has not been adjudicated, a stay has been entered in the third case and significant legal and factual issues remain to be determined in all three cases. 
  In addition to the matters referenced above, we are involved in legal actions in the course of our business, some of which seek monetary damages.  We do not believe that the outcome of these proceedings, both individually and in the aggregate, will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Regulatory Matters 
  Periodically, we are subject to audits, examinations and investigations by federal, state and local governmental authorities and receive subpoenas, civil investigative demands or other requests for information from such governmental authorities in connection with their regulatory or investigative authority.  We are currently responding to such inquiries from governmental authorities  
  
   23 

     Table of Contents

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (  Continued  ) 

relating to certain aspects of our business.  We believe it is premature to predict the potential outcome or to estimate any potential financial impact in connection with these inquiries. 
  Ocwen Related Matters 
  Ocwen is our largest customer and   56%   of our revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (  56%   of revenue for the   third quarter   of   2016  ) was from Ocwen.  Additionally,   19%   of our revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (  19%   of revenue for the   third quarter   of   2016  ) was earned on the portfolios serviced by Ocwen, when a party other than Ocwen selected Altisource as the service provider.  
  Ocwen has disclosed that it is subject to a number of ongoing federal and state regulatory examinations, consent orders, inquiries, requests for information and other actions and is subject to pending legal proceedings that have or could result in adverse regulatory or other actions against Ocwen.  While not all inclusive, regulatory actions to date have included subjecting Ocwen to independent oversight of its operations and placing certain restrictions on its ability to acquire servicing rights.  Ocwen may become subject to future federal and state regulatory investigations, inquiries, requests for information and legal proceedings, any of which could also result in adverse regulatory or other actions against Ocwen. 
  As a result of the sale of substantially all of the assets of HLSS to   NRZ   in April of 2015,   NRZ   owned the rights to approximately   78%   of Ocwen s non-government-sponsored enterprise ( non-GSE ) servicing rights as of June 30, 2016.  Under an agreement between   NRZ   and Ocwen,   NRZ   has the right (not necessarily the obligation or ability) to transfer servicing away from Ocwen if Ocwen does not maintain certain minimum servicer ratings on or after April 6, 2017. 
  Any or all of the foregoing may have significant adverse effects on Ocwen s business and our continuing relationships with Ocwen.  For example, Ocwen may be required to alter the way it conducts business, including the parties it contracts with for services (including information technology and software services), it may be required to seek changes to its existing pricing structure with us, it may lose or sell some or all of its non-GSE servicing rights or subservicing arrangements or may lose one or more of its state servicing licenses.  Additional regulatory actions or adverse financial developments may impose additional restrictions on or require changes in Ocwen s business that could require it to sell assets or change its business operations.  Any or all of these effects could result in our eventual loss of Ocwen as a customer or a reduction in the number and/or volume of services they purchase from us or the loss of other customers. 
  If any of the following events occurred, Altisource s revenue would be significantly lower and our results of operations would be materially adversely affected, including from the possible impairment or write-off of goodwill, intangible assets, property and equipment, other assets and accounts receivable: 
             
    Altisource loses Ocwen as a customer or there is a significant reduction in the volume of services they purchase from us 
                
    Ocwen loses or sells a significant portion or all of its non-GSE servicing rights or subservicing arrangements and Altisource fails to be retained as a service provider 
                
    Ocwen loses state servicing licenses in states with a significant number of loans in Ocwen s servicing portfolio  
                
    Altisource fails to be retained as a service provider 
                
    The contractual relationship between Ocwen and Altisource changes significantly or there are significant changes to our pricing to Ocwen for services from which we generate material revenue 
     Management cannot predict the outcome of the above Ocwen related matters or the impact they may have on Altisource.  However, in the event these Ocwen related matters materially negatively impact Altisource, we believe the impact to Altisource would occur over an extended period of time and the variable nature of our cost structure would allow us to realign our cost structure in line with remaining revenue. 
  In this regard, we have a plan that we believe would allow us to efficiently execute on this realignment.  We believe that transfers of Ocwen s servicing rights to a successor servicer(s) would take an extended period of time because of the approval required from many parties, including regulators, rating agencies, RMBS trustees, lenders and others.  During this period of time, we believe we would continue to generate revenue from the services we provide to the transferred portfolio.  Additionally, we have several strategic initiatives that focus on diversifying and growing our revenue and customer base.  Our major strategic initiatives include growing our: 
             
    Servicer Solutions business 
                
    Origination Solutions business 
                
    Consumer Real Estate Solutions business 
                
    Real Estate Investor Solutions business 
     
   24

  ALTISOURCE PORTFOLIO SOLUTIONS S.A. 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (  Continued  ) 

We have an established sales and marketing strategy to support each of these initiatives. 
  Management believes our plans, together with current liquidity and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other cash needs.  However, there can be no assurance that our plans will be successful or our operations will be profitable. 
  Escrow and Trust Balances 
  We hold customers  assets in escrow and trust accounts at various financial institutions pending completion of certain real estate activities.  We also hold cash in trust accounts at various financial institutions where contractual obligations mandate maintaining dedicated bank accounts for our Financial Services segment s collections.  These amounts are held in escrow and trust accounts for limited periods of time and are not included in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  Amounts held in escrow and trust accounts were   $65.6 million   and   $66.6 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
   
  NOTE 23       SEGMENT REPORTING 
  Our business segments are based upon our organizational structure, which focuses primarily on the services offered, and are consistent with the internal reporting used by our Chief Executive Officer (our Chief Operating Decision Maker) to evaluate operating performance and to assess the allocation of our resources. 
  We classify our businesses into   three   reportable segments.  The   Mortgage Services   segment provides loan servicers, originators, rental property investors and real estate consumers with products, services and technologies that span the mortgage and real estate lifecycle.  The   Financial Services   segment provides collection and customer relationship management services primarily to debt originators and servicers (e.g., credit card, auto lending, retail credit and mortgage) and the utility, insurance and hotel industries. The   Technology Services   segment     provides software and data analytics solutions that support the management of mortgage and real estate activities and marketplace transactions across the mortgage and real estate lifecycles and information technology infrastructure management services.  In addition,   Corporate Items and Eliminations   include eliminations of transactions between the reportable segments, interest expense and costs related to corporate support functions including executive, finance, law, compliance, human resources, vendor management, risk management and sales and marketing costs not allocated to the business units.  Intercompany transactions primarily consist of information technology infrastructure management services. 
  Financial information for our segments is as follows:

OVERVIEW 
  Our Business 
  When we refer to  Altisource,  the  Company,   we,   us  or  our  we mean Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A., a Luxembourg soci t  anonyme, or public limited liability company, and its subsidiaries. 
  We are a premier marketplace and transaction solutions provider for the real estate, mortgage and consumer debt industries.  Altisource s proprietary business processes, vendor and electronic payment management software and behavioral science-based analytics improve outcomes for marketplace participants. 
  We classify our businesses into the following three reportable segments: 
  Mortgage Services:     Provides loan servicers, originators, rental property investors and real estate consumers with products, services and technologies that span the mortgage and real estate lifecycle.  Within the Mortgage Services segment, we provide: 
  Asset Management Services   - the products, services and technologies typically used or licensed by loan servicers, rental property investors and real estate consumers to purchase, preserve, renovate, lease, manage, sell and auction single family residential real estate. 
  Origination Services     - the products, solutions and services typically used or licensed by loan originators (or other similar mortgage market participants) in producing residential mortgages. Altisource also manages Best Partners Mortgage Cooperative, Inc., a mortgage cooperative doing business as Lenders One        ( Lenders One ), for mortgage originators that provides its members with networking opportunities, industry related education and cost effective services and tools to help them increase revenue and improve profitability. 
  Insurance Services     - origination and default related title insurance and settlement services for institutions and consumers, certified loan insurance and certification products to protect mortgage market participants against loses caused by mortgage underwriting defects, and residential and commercial loan and insurance claim disbursement processing, risk mitigation and construction inspection services. 
  Property Valuation Services   - traditional appraisal management services and a variety of broker and non-broker valuation products to support mortgage originators, loan servicers, rental property investors and consumers. 
  Default Management Services   - foreclosure trustee services for loan servicers and non-legal processing and related services for and under the supervision of foreclosure, bankruptcy and eviction attorneys. 
  Financial Services  :  Provides collection and customer relationship management services primarily to debt originators and servicers (e.g., credit card, auto lending, retail credit and mortgage) and the utility, insurance and hotel industries.  Within the Financial Services segment, we provide the following services: 
  Asset recovery management   - asset recovery management principally includes post-charge-off debt collection services on a contingency fee basis. 
  Customer relationship management   - customer relationship management principally includes customer care, technical support and early stage collections services as well as insurance call center services and administrative support. 
  Technology Services  :     Provides software and data analytics solutions that support the management of mortgage and real estate activities and marketplace transactions across the mortgage and real estate lifecycles and information technology ( IT ) infrastructure management services.  Within the Technology Services segment, we provide: 
  Software Services   - software and data analytics solutions that facilitate process automation, rules management, controls enforcement, data security, marketplace enablement and analytics-driven outcomes across the real estate and mortgage lifecycle.  We provide these capabilities primarily as software-as-a-service (or SaaS) to our customers and as enabling technologies to other Altisource business segments through a shared services model.  Our servicer technologies include residential and commercial loan servicing, loss mitigation (loan modification, short sales, deed-in-lieu) and default servicing (real estate owned ( REO ), foreclosure, bankruptcy, eviction).

IT Infrastructure Services   - IT management services including, among others, desktop support, data center support, network management, telephony services, application management and IT security.  Some or all of these services are provided to Ocwen, Altisource Residential Corporation ( Residential ) and Altisource Asset Management Corporation through services agreements, and to other Altisource business segments through a shared services model. 
  Corporate Items and Eliminations  :  Includes interest expense and costs related to corporate support functions including executive, finance, law, compliance, human resources, vendor management, risk management and sales and marketing costs not allocated to the business units, and also includes eliminations of transactions between the reportable segments.  Corporate Items and Eliminations also include the cost of certain facilities. 
  We classify revenue in three categories: service revenue, revenue from reimbursable expenses and non-controlling interests.  In evaluating our performance, we focus on service revenue.  Service revenue consists of amounts attributable to our fee-based services.  Reimbursable expenses and non-controlling interests are pass-through items for which we earn no margin.  Reimbursable expenses consist of amounts we incur on behalf of our customers in performing our fee-based services, but we pass such costs directly on to our customers without any additional markup.  Non-controlling interests represent the earnings of Lenders One and Best Partners Mortgage Brokers Cooperative, Inc., a mortgage cooperative doing business as Wholesale One       , consolidated entities not owned by Altisource, and are included in revenue and reduced from net income to arrive at net income attributable to Altisource. 
  Stock Repurchase Plan 
  On May 18, 2016, our shareholders approved a new share repurchase program, which replaced the previous share repurchase program.  Under the new program, we are authorized to purchase up to   4.6 million   shares of our common stock, based on a limit of   25%   of the outstanding shares of common stock on the date of approval at a minimum price of   $1.00   per share and a maximum price of   $500.00   per share.  This is in addition to amounts previously purchased under prior programs.  Under the existing and prior programs, we purchased   1.3 million   shares of common stock at an average price of   $26.94   per share during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   1.8 million   shares at an average price of   $27.90   per share during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   (  0.5 million   shares at an average price of   $28.68   per share for the   third quarter   of   2016   and   0.2 million   shares at an average price of   $26.88   per share for the   third quarter   of   2015  ).  As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   4.0 million   shares of common stock remain available for repurchase under the new program.  Our senior secured term loan limits the amount we can spend on share repurchases and may prevent repurchases in certain circumstances.  As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $379 million   was available to repurchase our common stock under our senior secured term loan. 
  Strategy and Growth Initiatives 
  Altisource provides a suite of mortgage, real estate and consumer debt services, leveraging our technology platform and global operations.  Altisource is focused on becoming one of the premier providers of mortgage and real estate marketplaces and related services to a broad and diversified customer base.  Within the mortgage and real estate markets, we facilitate transactions and provide products, solutions and services related to home sales, home purchases, home rentals, home maintenance, mortgage origination and mortgage servicing. 
  Strategically, we are focused on (1) our four key business initiatives discussed below, (2) continuing to strengthen our compliance management system and (3) maintaining strong performance and relationships with our strategic customers. 
  Each of our four key business initiatives positions Altisource to grow and diversify our customer and revenue base.  We believe these initiatives address very large markets and directly leverage our core competencies and distinct competitive advantages.  Our four strategic initiatives and a brief description of each follow: 
  Mortgage market: 
  Grow our Servicer Solutions business (the products, services and technologies typically used or licensed by loan servicers): We are focused on growing referrals from our existing customer base, expanding the service and proprietary technology offerings to our customer base, and attracting new customers to our offerings.  Even as loan delinquencies return to historical norms, we believe there is a very large addressable market for our offerings.  We are one of only a few providers with a broad suite of servicer solutions, nationwide coverage and demonstrated scalability.  We believe we are well positioned to gain market share as customers consolidate to larger, full-service providers and outsource services that have historically been performed in-house. 
  Grow our Origination Solutions business (the products, services, solutions and technologies typically used or licensed by loan originators or other similar mortgage market participants): We are focused on continuing to build an industry leading, fully-integrated origination solutions platform leveraging our industry expertise and proprietary technologies.  We have a strong customer base that includes Lenders One members and Mortgage Builder, Trelix (formerly known as Altisource Origination Solutions) and CastleLine customers.  Our platform allows us to leverage referrals from our existing customer base, expand the quality and the  
  
   30 

     Table of Contents  

character of our offerings and attract new customers.  We believe we are well positioned to grow and gain market share as customers continue to utilize larger, full-service providers to outsource services and solutions that had historically been performed in-house. 
  Real estate market: 
  Grow our Consumer Real Estate Solutions business (a marketplace that connects home buyers and home sellers and offers the related services) primarily through Owners.com: Capitalizing on our core competencies in realty services, we have entered the consumer market by targeting the growing segment of self-directed consumers.  This segment wants to self-manage part of the realty process, but still needs brokerage services to complete the transaction.  Through our Owners.com brand, we are empowering consumers to perform certain tasks on their own such as searching for properties and listing and showing their own homes for sale, while offering the necessary realty services to complete the transaction with significant savings.  We believe our right-sized offering and compelling savings value proposition is being well received by our target market and we are well positioned to become the market leader for the self-directed real estate consumer. 
  Grow our Real Estate Investor Solutions business (a marketplace that connects home buyers and home sellers of single-family-rental homes and offers the related services to buy, renovate, manage and sell homes): We are focused on supporting the growth of our existing customers, expanding the offerings to our customer base and attracting new customers to our offerings.  The single-family-rental market is large, geographically distributed with fragmented ownership. Our nationwide acquisition, renovation, property management, leasing and dispositions platform provides a strong value proposition for institutional and retail investors and positions us well for long term growth. 
  There can be no assurance that growth from our strategic initiatives will be successful or our operations will be profitable. 
  Ocwen Related Matters 
  Revenue from Ocwen represented   56%   of our revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (  56%   of revenue for the   third quarter   of   2016  ).  Additionally,   19%   of our revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (  19%   of revenue for the   third quarter   of   2016  ) was earned on the portfolios serviced by Ocwen, when a party other than Ocwen selected Altisource as the service provider. 
  Ocwen has disclosed that it is subject to a number of ongoing federal and state regulatory examinations, consent orders, inquiries, requests for information and other actions and is subject to pending legal proceedings that have or could result in adverse regulatory or other actions against Ocwen.  While not all inclusive, regulatory actions to date have included subjecting Ocwen to independent oversight of its operations and placing certain restrictions on its ability to acquire servicing rights.  Ocwen may become subject to future federal and state regulatory investigations, inquiries, requests for information and legal proceedings, any of which could also result in adverse regulatory or other actions against Ocwen (see   Note 22   to the condensed consolidated financial statements).  Management cannot predict the outcome of these Ocwen related matters or the impact they may have on Altisource.  However, in the event these Ocwen related matters materially negatively impact Altisource, we believe the impact to Altisource would occur over an extended period of time and the variable nature of our cost structure would allow us to realign our cost structure in line with remaining revenue. 
  In this regard, we have a plan that we believe would allow us to efficiently execute on this realignment.  We believe that transfers of Ocwen s servicing rights to a successor servicer(s) would take an extended period of time because of the approval required from many parties, including regulators, rating agencies, residential mortgage-backed securities trustees, lenders and others.  During this period of time, we believe we would continue to generate revenue from the services we provide to the transferred portfolio.  Additionally, we have several strategic initiatives that focus on diversifying and growing our revenue and customer base.  Our major strategic initiatives are described in the Strategy and Growth Initiatives section above.  We have an established sales and marketing strategy to support each of these initiatives. 
  Management believes our plans, together with current liquidity and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other cash needs.  However, there can be no assurance that our plans will be successful or our operations will be profitable.

Factors Affecting Comparability 
  The following items may impact the comparability of our results: 
               
    During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we purchased   4.1 million   shares of Residential common stock for   $48.2 million  , incurred expenses of   $3.4 million   and earned dividends of   $1.0 million   related to this investment (no comparative amounts in 2015); 
                
    On   July 29, 2016  , we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of   Granite Loan Management of Delaware, LLC   ( Granite ) for   $9.6 million   in cash at closing; 
                
    On October 9, 2015, we acquired GoldenGator, LLC (doing business as RentRange       ) ( RentRange ), REIsmart, LLC (doing business as Investability       ) ( Investability ) and Onit Solutions, LLC, a support company for RentRange and Investability, for   $24.8 million  , composed of   $17.5 million   in cash and   247 thousand   shares of restricted common stock of the Company with a value of   $7.3 million   as of the closing date; 
                
    On July 17, 2015, we acquired CastleLine Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries ( CastleLine ) for   $33.4 million  .  The purchase consideration was composed of   $12.3 million   of cash at closing,   $10.5 million   of cash payable over four years from the acquisition date and   495 thousand   shares of restricted common stock of the Company with a value of   $14.4 million   as of the closing date.  Of the cash payable following acquisition,   $3.8 million   is contingent on certain future employment conditions of certain of the sellers, and therefore excluded from the purchase price; 
                
    During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we paid the former owners of Equator, LLC ( Equator )   $0.5 million   to extinguish any liability for Equator related contingent consideration ( Equator Earn Out ).  In connection with this settlement, we reduced the liability for the Equator Earn Out to   $0   and recognized a   $7.6 million   increase in earnings; 
                
    During the   nine   month ended   September 30, 2015  , we recognized a loss on the sale of equity securities of Home Loan Servicing Solutions, Ltd. ( HLSS ), net of dividends received, of   $1.9 million  ; 
                
    Effective March 31, 2015, we terminated the Data Access and Services Agreement with Ocwen; and 
                
    The effective income tax rate increased to   20.1%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   39.0%   for the   third quarter   of   2016   from an increase in our expected 2016 effective tax rate and adjustments to true-up the tax provision from prior quarters.  The effective tax rate increase was primarily due to lower pretax income margins, which changed the expected mix of taxable income across the jurisdictions in which we operate.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  Summary Consolidated Results 
  The following is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated.  For a more detailed discussion of the factors that affected the results of our business segments in these periods, see    Segment Results of Operations    below. 
  The following table sets forth information regarding our results of operations: 

Revenue 
  We recognized service revenue of   $715.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a   4%     increase   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   (  $239.8 million   for the   third quarter   of 2016, a   2%     decrease   compared to the   third quarter   of 2015).

     Table of Contents  

The increase in service revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily driven by revenue growth in the asset management services businesses from higher volumes of property preservation referrals, growth in the percentage of homes sold through auction on Hubzu and growth in the number of non-Ocwen properties sold on Hubzu in the Mortgage Services segment.  This increase was partially offset by decreases in IT infrastructure services in the Technology Services segment, which are typically billed on a cost plus basis, due to the transition of resources supporting Ocwen s technology infrastructure to Ocwen, decreases in software services revenue due to lower rates charged to Ocwen for certain services and a decline in the number of loans on REALServicing in the Technology Services segment and lower customer relationship management business as we have severed relationships with and reduced the volume of services provided to certain clients that were not profitable to us and we experienced a reduction in volume from the transition of services from one customer to another.  During the fourth quarter of 2015, we began transitioning resources supporting technology infrastructure to Ocwen as a part of the previously announced separation of technology infrastructure.  We anticipate this transition will be largely complete by December 31, 2016.  In addition, in early 2015, the pricing model to Ocwen for REO preservation services within asset management services changed.  Historically, we billed (1) a fixed fee per REO asset (which was recognized as service revenue) and (2) actual vendor costs (which were recognized as reimbursable expenses revenue).  Beginning in early 2015, our pricing for new Ocwen REO referrals is on a per service basis (which is recognized as service revenue).  This change results in certain services that were historically reimbursable expenses revenue becoming service revenue.  As a result, service revenue in the Mortgage Services segment asset management services businesses increased and reimbursable expenses revenue decreased.  
  Service revenue declined by 2% in the third quarter of 2016 as the revenue growth from non-Ocwen customers and higher property preservation referrals from Ocwen largely offset the expected loss in revenue from Ocwen s declining portfolio and lower delinquencies in addition to lower customer relationship management revenue, as described above. 
  Certain of our revenues are impacted by seasonality.  More specifically, Mortgage Services  revenue is impacted by REO sales and lawn maintenance, which tend to be at their lowest level during the fall and winter months and at their highest level during the spring and summer months.  Financial Services  asset recovery management revenue tends to be higher in the first quarter, as borrowers may utilize tax refunds and bonuses to pay debts, and generally declines throughout the rest of the year. 
  Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit 
  Cost of revenue principally includes payroll and employee benefits associated with personnel employed in customer service and operations roles, fees paid to external providers related to the provision of services, reimbursable expenses, technology and telecommunications costs and depreciation and amortization of operating assets. 
  We recognized cost of revenue of   $517.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a slight   increase   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   (  $174.0 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016  , a slight   increase   compared to the   third quarter   of    2015  ).  The increases were primarily driven by higher outside fees and services, largely offset by decreases in reimbursable expenses.  Outside fees and services increased due to higher volumes of property preservation referrals and the change in billing discussed in the revenue section above, partially offset for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   by the March 31, 2015 termination of the Data Access and Services Agreement.  Reimbursable expenses declined as a result of the change in billing discussed in the revenue section above.  Compensation and benefits costs increased, particularly in the second and third quarters of 2016, from our investments to support certain of our growth initiatives in the Mortgage Services segment, partially offset by cost savings initiatives and the transition of resources supporting technology infrastructure to Ocwen. 
  Gross profit decreased to   $241.4 million  , representing   34%   of service revenue, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $266.7 million  , representing   39%   of service revenue, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   (decreased to   $78.7 million  , representing   33%   of service revenue, for the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   $98.9 million  , representing   40%   of service revenue, for the   third quarter   of   2015  ).  Gross profit as a percentage of service revenue decreased primarily due to higher growth in the lower margin property preservation services, higher compensation and benefits costs in the Mortgage Services segment to support our growth initiatives and reductions in volumes and prices in the Technology Services segment that exceeded the decline in costs.  The decrease for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was partially offset by the March 31, 2015 termination of the Data Access and Services Agreement with Ocwen. 
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses, Other Operating Expenses and Income from Operations 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG A ) include payroll for personnel employed in executive, finance, law, compliance, human resources, vendor management, risk management, sales and marketing roles.  This category also includes occupancy costs, amortization of intangible assets, professional services, marketing costs and depreciation and amortization. 
  We recognized SG A of   $161.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a   4%     increase   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   (  $53.9 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016  , a   5%     increase   compared to the   third quarter   of  
  
   34 

     Table of Contents  

2015  ).  The increases were primarily due to higher amortization of intangible assets and an increase in marketing costs, primarily related to Owners.com, as we launched our buy side brokerage marketing campaign in 2016, partially offset by lower occupancy costs due to the completion of several office relocations in 2015. 
  We recognized a gain in other operating expenses on the change in the fair value of the Equator Earn Out of   $7.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The liability for contingent consideration was reflected at fair value and adjusted each reporting period with the change in fair value recognized in earnings.  In 2015, we reached an agreement with the former owners of Equator to extinguish any liability for the Equator Earn Out.  In connection with this settlement, we reduced the liability for the Equator Earn Out to   $0   and recognized a   $7.6 million   increase in earnings. 
  Income from operations decreased to   $79.7 million  , representing   11%   of service revenue, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $119.0 million  , representing   17%   of service revenue, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   (decreased to   $24.9 million  , representing   10%   of service revenue, for the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   $47.6 million  , representing   19%   of service revenue, for the   third quarter   of   2015  ).  The decreases in operating income margin were primarily the result of decreases in gross profit margin, higher SG A expenses and the 2015 Equator Earn Out gain, as discussed above. 
  Other Income (Expense), net 
  Other income (expense), net principally includes interest expense and other non-operating gains and losses.  Interest expense was   $18.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $2.9 million   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   (  $6.0 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016  , a decrease of   $1.1 million   compared to the   third quarter   of   2015  ), primarily from the   2016   and   2015   repurchases of portions of our senior secured term loan with an aggregate par value of   $100.0 million  . 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we repurchased portions of our senior secured term loan with an aggregate par value of   $51.0 million   at a weighted average discount of   13.2%  , recognizing a net gain of   $5.5 million   on the early extinguishment of debt (no repurchases in the   third quarter   of   2016  ).  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we repurchased portions of our senior secured term loan with an aggregate par value of   $27.0 million   at a weighted average discount of   9.8%  , recognizing a net gain of   $2.0 million   on the early extinguishment of debt (repurchased aggregate par value of   $11.0 million   at a weighted average discount of   11.0%  , recognizing a net gain of   $0.9 million   on the early extinguishment of debt for the   third quarter   of   2015  ). 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we purchased   4.1 million   shares of Residential common stock for   $48.2 million  , incurred expenses of   $3.4 million   and earned dividends of   $1.0 million   related to this investment (  no   comparative amounts in 2015). 
  During March 2015, we purchased   1.6 million   shares of HLSS common stock in the open market for   $30.0 million  .  On April 6, 2015, HLSS completed the sale of substantially all of its assets to New Residential Investment Corp. (   NRZ   ) and adopted a plan of complete liquidation and dissolution.  During April 2015, we received liquidating dividends and other dividends from HLSS totaling   $20.4 million   and we sold all of our   1.6 million   shares of HLSS common stock in the open market for   $7.7 million  .  As a result of these transactions, we recognized a net loss of   $1.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   (no comparative amounts in   2016  ) in connection with our investment in HLSS. 
  Income Tax Provision 
  We recognized an income tax provision of   $12.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $8.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   (  $7.3 million   and   $3.3 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016   and   2015  , respectively).  Our effective tax rate was   20.1%   and   8.3%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively (  39.0%   and   8.0%   for the   third quarter   of   2016   and   2015  , respectively).  Our effective tax rate differs from the Luxembourg statutory tax rate of   29.2%   primarily due to the effect of certain deductions in Luxembourg and the mix of income and losses with varying tax rates in multiple taxing jurisdictions. The income tax provision for the third quarter of 2016 reflects an increase in the 2016 effective tax rate and adjustments to true-up the tax provision from prior quarters, resulting in an anticipated 2016 annual effective tax rate of approximately 20%.  The higher effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily the result of lower pretax income margins which changed the expected mix of taxable income across the jurisdictions in which we operate.  Our consolidated effective income tax rate for financial reporting purposes may change periodically due to changes in enacted tax rates, fluctuations in the mix of income earned from our domestic and international operations and our ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.

SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  The following section provides a discussion of pretax results of operations of our business segments.  Transactions between segments are accounted for as third party arrangements for purposes of presenting segment results of operations.  Intercompany transactions primarily consist of IT infrastructure management services and professional services billed by Technology Services.  We reflect these as service revenue in the Technology Services segment and technology and telecommunications costs within cost of revenue and SG A in the segment receiving the services.  Certain prior year SG A cost allocations from Corporate to the segments have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Mortgage Services 
  Revenue 
  Revenue by service line was as follows: 

We recognized service revenue of   $569.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a   16%     increase   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   (  $191.8 million   for the   third quarter   of 2016, a   5%     increase   compared to the   third quarter   of 2015). 
  The increase in service revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to revenue growth in the asset management services businesses from higher volumes of property preservation referrals, growth in the percentage of homes sold through auction on Hubzu, growth in the number of non-Ocwen properties sold on Hubzu and customer growth in origination services.  In addition, in early 2015, the pricing model to Ocwen for REO preservation services within asset management services changed.  Historically, we billed (1) a fixed fee per REO asset (which was recognized as service revenue) and (2) actual vendor costs (which were recognized as reimbursable expenses revenue).  Beginning in early 2015, our pricing for new Ocwen REO referrals is on a per service basis (which is recognized as service revenue).  This change results in certain services that were historically reimbursable expenses revenue becoming service revenue.  As a result, service revenue in the asset management services businesses increased and reimbursable expenses revenue decreased.  The increase was partially offset by decreases in insurance services and default management services due to a reduction in foreclosure file referrals. 
  The increase in service revenue for the   third quarter   of   2016   was primarily due to growth in the volume of property preservation referrals, as described above. 
  Certain of our Mortgage Services businesses are impacted by seasonality.  REO sales and lawn maintenance services within the asset management services business are generally lowest during the fall and winter months and highest during the spring and summer months.

Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit 
  Cost of revenue consists of the following: 

Cost of revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $381.5 million     increased   by   9%   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   (  $132.4 million   for the   third quarter   of 2016, an   8%     increase   compared to the   third quarter   of 2015).  The increases were primarily attributable to higher outside fees and services, compensation and benefits costs and technology and telecommunications costs, partially offset by a decrease in reimbursable expenses.  Outside fees and services increased from a higher volume of property preservation referrals and the change in billing discussed in the revenue section above, partially offset for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   by the termination of the Data Access and Services Agreement effective March 31, 2015.  Compensation and benefits costs and technology and telecommunications costs increased from our investments to support certain of our growth initiatives.  Reimbursable expenses declined primarily as a result of the change in billing discussed in the revenue section above. 
  Gross profit decreased to   $230.7 million  , representing   41%   of service revenue, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $233.6 million  , representing   47%   of service revenue, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   (decreased to   $72.3 million   representing   38%   of service revenue for the   third quarter   of 2016, compared to   $86.8 million   representing   48%   of service revenue for the   third quarter   of 2015).  Gross profit as a percentage of service revenue decreased from a change in revenue mix, as a higher percentage of revenue in 2016 was from lower margin property preservation services and higher compensation and benefits costs and technology and telecommunications costs, as described above.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , this decrease was partially offset by the March 31, 2015 termination of the Data Access and Services Agreement with Ocwen. 
  Our margins can vary substantially depending upon service revenue mix. 
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses and Income from Operations 
  SG A expenses consist of the following: 

SG A for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $83.1 million     increased   by   20%   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   (  $27.5 million   for the   third quarter   of 2016, an   18%     increase   compared to the   third quarter   of 2015).  The increases were primarily driven by higher amortization of intangible assets, marketing costs and compensation and benefits costs, partially offset by lower other costs.  The increase in marketing costs relates primarily to Owners.com, as we launched our buy side brokerage marketing campaign in 2016.  Compensation and benefits costs and occupancy related costs increased primarily due to growth of the sales and marketing organizations to support our revenue and customer diversification initiatives and higher  
  
   38 

     Table of Contents  

headcount to support certain of our growth initiatives.  The decrease in other costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to a favorable loss accrual adjustment for the three months ended March 31, 2016. 
  Income from operations decreased to   $147.6 million  , representing   26%   of service revenue, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $164.4 million  , representing   33%   of service revenue, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   (decreased to   $44.8 million   representing   23%   of service revenue for the   third quarter   of 2016, compared to   $63.4 million  , representing   35%   of service revenue for the   third quarter   of 2015).  The decreases in operating income margin were primarily the result of lower gross profit margins from the change in the revenue mix and higher SG A expenses, as discussed above. 
   
  Financial Services 
  Revenue 
  Revenue by service line was as follows: 

We recognized service revenue of   $57.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a   14%     decrease   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   (  $17.6 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016  , an   18%     decrease   compared to the   third quarter   of   2015  ).  The decreases were primarily due to lower customer relationship management business as we have severed relationships with and reduced the volume of services provided to certain clients that were not profitable to us and we experienced a reduction in volume from the transition of services from one customer to another. 
  Certain of our Financial Services businesses are impacted by seasonality.  Revenue in the asset recovery management business tends to be higher in the first quarter, as borrowers may utilize tax refunds and bonuses to pay debts, and generally declines throughout the remainder of the year. 
  Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit 
  Cost of revenue consists of the following: 

Cost of revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $41.6 million     decreased   by   10%   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   (  $13.2 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016  , a   14%     decrease   compared to the   third quarter   of   2015  ).  The decreases in cost of revenue were primarily due to a decrease in compensation and benefits costs and lower technology and  
  
   39 

     Table of Contents  

telecommunications costs resulting from the implementation of cost savings initiatives in 2015.  In addition, compensation and benefits costs were lower as a result of reduced headcount in the customer relationship management business, as discussed above. 
  Gross profit decreased to   $15.8 million  , representing   28%   of service revenue, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $21.0 million  , representing   31%   of service revenue, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   (decreased to   $4.4 million  , representing   25%   of service revenue, for the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   $5.9 million  , representing   28%   of service revenue, for the   third quarter   of   2015  ).  Gross profit margins declined as the decrease in customer relationship management revenue exceeded the reduction in expenses.  Revenue mix in the asset recovery management business also impacted gross profit margins with higher revenue in the lower margin credit card collections business and lower revenue in the higher margin mortgage charge-off collections business. 
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses and Income from Operations 
  SG A expenses consist of the following: 

SG A for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $12.5 million     decreased   by   10%   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   (  $4.0 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016  , a   12%     decrease   compared to the   third quarter   of   2015  ).  The decreases were primarily the result of lower compensation and benefits costs and occupancy related costs due to lower headcount in the customer relationship management business largely attributable to the reasons discussed above and lower professional services expenses driven by a decrease in legal costs. 
  Income from operations decreased to   $3.3 million  , representing   6%   of service revenue, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $7.2 million  , representing   11%   of service revenue, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   (decreased     to   $0.4 million  , representing   2%   of service revenue, for the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   $1.4 million  , representing   6%   of service revenue, for the   third quarter   of   2015  ).  The decreases in operating income as a percentage of service revenue were primarily the result of lower gross profit margins, partially offset by lower SG A, as discussed above. 
   
  Technology Services 
  Revenue 
  Revenue by service line was as follows: 

We recognized service revenue of   $120.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a   25%     decrease   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   (  $41.5 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016  , a   19%     decrease   compared to the   third quarter   of   2015  ).  The decreases were driven by lower IT infrastructure services due to the implementation of cost reduction initiatives and the transitioning of resources supporting Ocwen s technology infrastructure to Ocwen, which are generally billed on a cost  
  plus basis, and a decrease in software services revenue due to lower rates charged to Ocwen for certain technologies and a decline in the number of loans on REALServicing. 
  For segment presentation purposes, revenue from services provided by Technology Services to our other reportable segments is eliminated in consolidation.  This intercompany revenue is included as revenue in the Technology Services segment and as technology and telecommunications costs, a component of cost of revenue and SG A, in our other reportable segments. 
  Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit (Loss) 
  Cost of revenue consists of the following: 

Cost of revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $122.9 million     decreased   by   15%   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   (  $38.6 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016  , a   13%     decrease   compared to the   third quarter   of   2015  ).  The decreases were primarily due to lower compensation and benefits and technology and telecommunications costs driven by the implementation of cost savings initiatives in 2015 and the transition of resources supporting technology infrastructure to Ocwen as part of the infrastructure separation.  In addition, compensation and benefits costs for the   nine   months ended September 30,   2016   and   2015   include $0.6 million and $3.2 million, respectively, of severance expense related to the reduction of staff. 
  Gross loss was   $(2.6) million  , representing   (2)%   of service revenue, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to gross profit of   $14.8 million  , representing   9%   of service revenue, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   (gross profit was   $3.0 million  , representing   7%   of service revenue, for the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   $7.0 million  , representing   14%   of service revenue, for the   third quarter   of   2015  ) as the decline in revenue exceeded the decline in compensation and benefits costs and technology and telecommunications costs. 
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses, Other Operating Expenses and Income (Loss) from Operations 
  SG A expenses consist of the following: 

SG A for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $20.1 million     decreased   by   9%   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   (  $6.1 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016  , a   20%     decrease   compared to the   third quarter   of   2015  ).  The decreases were primarily driven by lower occupancy costs related to facility consolidation and relocation during 2015, lower amortization of intangible assets driven by the write-off of certain intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2015 and lower compensation and benefits from the implementation of cost savings initiatives in 2015, partially offset by an increase in professional services due to higher legal and regulatory costs and higher depreciation and amortization related to the facility consolidations and relocations in 2015.

We recognized a gain in other operating expenses on the change in fair value of the Equator Earn Out of   $7.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The liability for contingent consideration was reflected at fair value and adjusted each reporting period with the change in fair value recognized in earnings.  In 2015, we reached an agreement with the former owners of Equator to extinguish any liability for the Equator Earn Out.  In connection with this settlement, we reduced the liability for the Equator Earn Out to $0 and recognized a   $7.6 million   increase in earnings. 
  Loss from operations was   $(22.7) million  , representing   (19)%   of service revenue, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to income from operations of   $0.2 million  , representing less than 1% of service revenue, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   (loss from operations was   $(3.1) million  , representing   (8)%   of service revenue, for the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to loss from operations of   $(0.6) million  , representing   (1)%   of service revenue, for the   third quarter   of   2015  ).  Loss from operations as a percentage of service revenue increased primarily due to the decrease in service revenue, partially offset by the decreases in cost of revenue and SG A, as discussed above. 
   
  Corporate Items and Eliminations 
  Corporate Items and Eliminations include interest expense, costs related to corporate support functions including executive, finance, law, compliance, human resources, vendor management, risk management, sales and marketing cost not allocated to the business units and non-operating items.  It also includes eliminations of transactions between the reportable segments.  
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses and Other Income (Expense), net 
  Corporate costs consist of the following: 

SG A for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $46.0 million     decreased   by   8%   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   (  $16.2 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016  , a   3%     increase   compared to the   third quarter   of   2015  ).  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the decrease was primarily driven by lower legal and regulatory costs and occupancy related costs and increased support department allocations to the segments.  SG A for the third quarter of 2016 was largely consistent with the third quarter of 2015. 
  Other income (expense), net primarily includes interest expense and other non-operating gains and losses.  Other income (expense), net for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $16.1 million     decreased   by   26%   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   (  $6.1 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016  , a   6%     decrease   compared to the   third quarter   of   2015  ).  Interest expense was   $18.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a   decrease   of   $2.9 million   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   (  $6.0 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016  , a   decrease   of   $1.1 million   compared to the   third quarter   of   2015  ), primarily from the 2016 and 2015 repurchases of our senior secured term loan with an aggregate par value of   $100.0 million  . 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we repurchased portions of our senior secured term loan with an aggregate par value of   $51.0 million   at a weighted average discount of   13.2%  , recognizing a net gain of   $5.5 million   on the early extinguishment of debt (no repurchases in the   third quarter   of   2016  ).  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we repurchased portions of our senior secured term loan with an aggregate par value of   $27.0 million   at a weighted average discount of   9.8%  , recognizing a net gain of   $2.0 million   on the early extinguishment of debt (repurchased aggregate par value of   $11.0 million   at a weighted average discount of   11.0%  , recognizing a net gain of   $0.9 million   on the early extinguishment of debt for the third quarter of 2015). 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we purchased   4.1 million   shares of Residential common stock for   $48.2 million  , incurred expenses of   $3.4 million   and earned dividends of   $1.0 million   related to this investment (  no   comparative amounts in   2015  ). 
  During March 2015, we purchased   1.6 million   shares of HLSS common stock in the open market for   $30.0 million  .  On April 6, 2015, HLSS completed the sale of substantially all of its assets to   NRZ   and adopted a plan of complete liquidation and dissolution.  During April 2015, we received liquidating dividends and other dividends from HLSS totaling   $20.4 million   and we sold all of our   1.6 million   shares of HLSS common stock in the open market for   $7.7 million  .  As a result of these transactions, we recognized a net loss of   $1.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   (  no   comparative amounts in   2016  ) in connection with our investment in HLSS. 
  Intercompany revenue that is eliminated in consolidation   increased   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the similar periods in   2015  .  These intercompany transactions consisted primarily of IT infrastructure services which are billed on a cost plus basis along with professional services billed by Technology Services.  The increase was due to the increase in technology costs related to higher volume of activity primarily in Mortgage Services segment.  While the expenses are recognized in the Mortgage Services and Financial Services segments above, the elimination of these expenses is reflected in Corporate Items and Eliminations. 
   
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  Liquidity 
  Our primary source of liquidity is cash flows from operations.  We seek to deploy excess cash generated in a disciplined manner.  Principally, we intend to use excess cash to develop complementary services and businesses that we believe will generate attractive margins in line with our core capabilities and strategy.  We may also use cash to repurchase and repay our senior secured term loan and repurchase shares of our common stock.  We also consider and evaluate business acquisitions that may arise from time to time that are aligned with our strategy. 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we used   $49.2 million   to repay and repurchase portions of the senior secured term loan and make contractual repayments of the senior secured term loan ($1.5 million for the   third quarter   of   2016  ) and   $34.3 million   to repurchase shares of our common stock ($14.6 million for the   third quarter   of   2016  ). 
  Senior Secured Term Loan 
  On November 27, 2012, Altisource Solutions S.  r.l., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A., entered into a senior secured term loan agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain lenders.  Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. and certain wholly-owned subsidiaries are guarantors of the term loan.  We subsequently amended the senior secured term loan agreement to increase the principal amount of the senior secured term loan and, among other changes, re-establish the   $200.0 million   incremental term loan facility accordion, lower the interest rate, extend the maturity date by approximately one year and increase the maximum amount of Restricted Junior Payments (as defined in the senior secured term loan agreement; other capitalized terms, unless defined herein, are defined in the senior secured term loan agreement).  The lenders of the senior secured term loan, as amended, have no obligation to provide any such additional debt under the accordion provision.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $481.1 million   was outstanding under the senior secured term loan agreement, as amended, compared to   $536.6 million   as of   December 31, 2015  . 
  After giving effect to the third amendment entered into on August 1, 2014, the term loan must be repaid in equal consecutive quarterly principal installments of   $1.5 million  , which commenced on September 30, 2014, with the balance due at maturity.  All amounts outstanding under the senior secured term loan agreement will become due on the earlier of (i) December 9, 2020 and (ii) the date on which the loans are declared to be due and owing by the administrative agent at the request (or with the consent) of the Required Lenders or as otherwise provided in the senior secured term loan agreement upon the occurrence of any event of default under the senior secured term loan agreement.  However, if the leverage ratio exceeds 3.00 to 1.00, as calculated in accordance with the provisions of the senior secured term loan agreement, a percentage of cash flows must be used to repay principal (the percentage increases if the leverage ratio exceeds 3.50 to 1.00).  No mandatory prepayments were required for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The interest rate as of   September 30, 2016   was   4.50%  . 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we repurchased portions of our senior secured term loan with an aggregate par value of   $51.0 million   at a weighted average discount of   13.2%  , recognizing a net gain of   $5.5 million   on the early extinguishment of debt (  no   repurchases in the   third quarter   of   2016  ).  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we repurchased portions of our senior secured term loan with an aggregate par value of   $27.0 million   at a weighted average discount of   9.8%  , recognizing a net gain of   $2.0 million   on the early extinguishment of debt (repurchased aggregate par value of   $11.0

million   at a weighted average discount of   11.0%  , recognizing a net gain of   $0.9 million   on the early extinguishment of debt for the third quarter of 2015).   
  The debt covenants in the senior secured term loan agreement limit, among other things, our ability to incur additional debt, pay dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock.  In the event we require additional liquidity, our ability to obtain it may be limited by the senior secured term loan. 
  Cash Flows 
  The following table presents our cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30  : 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
  Cash flows from operating activities generally consist of the cash effects of transactions and events that enter into the determination of net income.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we generated cash flows from operating activities of   $106.0 million  , or approximately   $0.15   for every dollar of service revenue (  $0.15   for every dollar of service revenue for the   third quarter   of   2016  ) compared to cash flows from operating activities of   $109.2 million  , or approximately   $0.16   for every dollar of service revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   (  $0.22   for every dollar of service revenue for the   third quarter   of   2015  ).  The   decrease   in cash flows from operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was principally driven by lower net income, partially offset by an improvement in working capital changes.  Changes in working capital were principally driven by higher collections of accounts receivable and the timing of payment of accounts payable and other accrued expenses, partially offset by higher prepaid expenses and other current assets from our investment in real estate that we are renovating and intend to sell and payments totaling $2.9 million related to deferred purchase consideration for the July 17, 2015 acquisition of CastleLine. 
  Operating cash flows per service revenue dollar can be negatively impacted because of the nature of some of our services.  Certain services are performed immediately following or shortly after the referral, but the collection of the receivable does not occur until a specific event occurs (e.g., the foreclosure is complete, the REO asset is sold, etc.) and our cash flows from operations may be negatively impacted when comparing one interim period to another. 
  Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
  Cash flows from investing activities primarily include capital expenditures, acquisitions of businesses and purchases and sales of available for sale securities.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we used   $16.5 million   and   $27.7 million  , respectively, for capital expenditures primarily related to investments in the development of certain software applications, IT infrastructure and facility build-outs. The decrease in capital expenditures primarily related to the completion of projects in 2015, including several office facility relocations.  In addition, during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we purchased   4.1 million   shares of Residential common stock for   $48.2 million  , including brokers  commissions.  On   July 29, 2016  , we acquired Granite for   $9.6 million  . 
  During March 2015, we purchased   1.6 million   shares of HLSS common stock for   $30.0 million  , including brokers  commissions.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we received $28.1 million from liquidating dividends and the sale of the HLSS common stock.  On July 17, 2015, we acquired CastleLine for   $11.2 million   of cash at acquisition, excluding cash balances acquired of $1.1 million.  Additionally, the acquisition includes   $10.5 million   of cash payable over four years from the acquisition date and   $14.4 million   of restricted common stock of the Company.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
  Cash flows from financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   include activities associated with share repurchases, debt repurchases and repayments, stock option exercises and payments to non-controlling interests.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we used   $34.3 million   and   $49.0 million  , respectively, to repurchase our common stock.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we used   $49.2 million   and   $29.1 million  , respectively, to repurchase portions of our senior secured term loan and make scheduled repayments of our senior secured term loan.  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we received   $8.9 million   and   $0.3 million  , respectively, from stock option exercises.  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we distributed   $1.6 million   and   $2.1 million  , respectively, to non-controlling interests. 
  Liquidity Requirements after   September 30, 2016 
  On September 12, 2014, we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Mortgage Builder Software, Inc. ( Mortgage Builder ).  The Mortgage Builder purchase agreement provides for the payment of up to $7.0 million in potential additional consideration based on Adjusted Revenue (as defined in the purchase agreement).  As of September 30, 2016, we have recorded $1.5 million of potential additional consideration related to the Mortgage Builder acquisition.  The amount ultimately paid will depend on Mortgage Builder s Adjusted Revenue in the three consecutive 12-month periods following acquisition. 
  On November 21, 2014, we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Owners Advantage, LLC ( Owners ).  The Owners purchase agreement provides for a payment of up to $7.0 million of potential additional consideration based on Adjusted Revenue (as defined in the purchase agreement) earned in the two consecutive 12-month periods following closing.  We estimated the fair value of the Owners contingent consideration to be $1.3 million as of   September 30, 2016  .  The amount ultimately paid will depend on Owners  Adjusted Revenue earned in the two consecutive 12-month periods following acquisition. 
  On July 17, 2015, we acquired CastleLine.  A portion of the purchase consideration totaling   $10.5 million   is payable to the sellers over four years from the acquisition date, including   $3.8 million   to be paid to certain of the sellers that is contingent on future employment.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have paid $2.9 million of the   $10.5 million   that is payable over four years from the acquisition date and $0 of the   $3.8 million   purchase consideration that is contingent on future employment. 
  During the   fourth   quarter of   2016  , we expect to distribute   $0.4 million   to the Lenders One members representing non-controlling interests and repay   $1.5 million   of the senior secured term loan. 
  We believe that we will generate sufficient cash flows from operations to fund capital expenditures and required debt and interest payments for the next 12 months. 
  Contractual Obligations, Commitments     and Contingencies 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were no significant changes to our contractual obligations from those identified in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  , other than those that occur in the normal course of business.  See   Note 22   to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
   
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT 
  We prepare our interim condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  In applying many of these accounting principles, we need to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses in our condensed consolidated financial statements.  We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances.  These assumptions, estimates and judgments, however, are often subjective.  Actual results may be negatively affected based on changing circumstances.  If actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. 
  Our critical accounting policies are described in the MD A section of our Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the SEC on March 15, 2016.  Those policies have not changed during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Future Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
  Market Risk 
  Our financial market risk consists primarily of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the interest rate charged on the senior secured term loan was   4.50%  .  The interest rate is calculated based on the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the senior secured term loan agreement) with a minimum floor of   1.00%   plus   3.50%  . 
  Based on the principal amount outstanding at   September 30, 2016  , a one percentage point increase in the Eurodollar Rate would increase our annual interest expense by approximately   $2.5 million  , based on the   September 30, 2016   Adjusted Eurodollar Rate.  There would be no change in our annual interest expense if there was a one percentage point decrease in the Eurodollar Rate. 
  Currency Exchange Risk 
  We are exposed to currency risk from potential changes in currency values of our non-United States dollar denominated expenses, assets, liabilities and cash flows.  Our most significant currency exposure relates to the Indian rupee.  Based on expenses incurred in Indian rupees during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a one percentage point increase or decrease in value of the Indian rupee in relation to the United States dollar would increase or decrease our annual expenses by approximately   $1.1 million  . 
   
  Item 4.  Controls and Procedures 
  Management, under the supervision of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report.  Based on such evaluation and solely because we have not completed remediation of the previously disclosed material weakness in internal control over financial reporting (see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015) related to ineffective controls related to the review of impairment indicators of long-lived assets, including premises and equipment, and the impairment analysis of indefinite-lived assets, primarily goodwill, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of   September 30, 2016  .  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
  We are in the process of implementing remediation measures to address the above-described material weakness and enhance the Company s internal control over financial reporting related to the review of impairment indicators of long-lived assets and the impairment analysis of indefinite-lived assets by taking the following actions: 
             
    Review the processes related to the impairment assessment of long-lived and indefinite-lived assets 
                
    Enhance review controls relating to the review of impairment indicators of long-lived assets and the impairment analysis of indefinite-lived assets 
                
    Test and evaluate the design and operating effectiveness of the control procedures 
                
    Assess the effectiveness of the remediation plan 
     In the third quarter of 2016, we began the process of implementing a remediation plan and intend to complete remediation of the material weakness by December 31, 2016.  We believe the remediation measures will strengthen the Company s internal control over financial reporting related to the review of impairment indicators of long-lived assets and the impairment analysis of indefinite-lived assets and will remediate the material weakness identified.  We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these remediation measures and will make any changes and take such other actions that we deem appropriate given the circumstances.  The material weakness will not be considered remediated until these plans have been fully implemented, tested and are operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. 
  Other than the steps taken in implementing our remediation plan, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1.  Legal Proceedings 
  From time to time, we are involved in legal and administrative proceedings arising in the course of our business.  We record a liability for these matters if an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, including expected insurance coverage.  For proceedings where the reasonable estimate of loss is a range, we record a best estimate of loss within the range. 
  On September 8, 2014, the West Palm Beach Firefighters  Pension Fund filed a putative securities class action suit against Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. and certain of its current or former officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 with regard to disclosures concerning pricing and transactions with related parties that allegedly inflated Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. share prices.  The Court subsequently appointed the Pension Fund for the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades District Council 35 and the Annuity Fund for the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades District Council 35 as Lead Plaintiffs.  On January 30, 2015, Lead Plaintiffs filed an amended class action complaint which added Ocwen Financial Corporation as a defendant, and seeks a determination that the action may be maintained as a class action on behalf of purchasers of Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. securities between April 25, 2013 and December 21, 2014 and an unspecified amount of damages.  Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. moved to dismiss the suit on March 23, 2015.  On September 4, 2015, the Court granted the defendants  motion to dismiss, finding that the Lead Plaintiffs  amended complaint failed to state a claim as to any of the defendants, but permitting the Lead Plaintiffs to file another amended complaint.  Lead Plaintiffs subsequently filed second and third amended complaints with substantially similar claims and theories.  Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. moved to dismiss the third amended complaint on October 22, 2015.  On December 22, 2015, the Court issued an order dismissing with prejudice all claims against Ocwen Financial Corporation and certain claims against Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. and the officer and director defendants, but denying the motion to dismiss as to other claims.  Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. intends to continue to vigorously defend this suit. 
  On February 11, 2015, W.A. Sokolowski, an alleged shareholder of Ocwen Financial Corporation, filed an amended shareholder derivative complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida against Ocwen Financial Corporation (as a nominal defendant), certain of its current or former officers and directors, Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. and other companies.  The suit seeks recovery of an unspecified amount of damages for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty by Ocwen Financial Corporation s officers and directors, which were allegedly aided and abetted by Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. and other defendants.  Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on November 9, 2015.  While that motion was pending, additional lawsuits alleging similar claims for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties by current or former Ocwen Financial Corporation officers and directors were filed in or transferred to the Court.  The Court subsequently consolidated these actions and denied Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. s motion to dismiss the Sokolowski complaint without prejudice to re-file following appointment of lead counsel for the consolidated action and the filing or designation of an operative complaint.  Lead counsel for plaintiffs filed their Consolidated Verified Shareholder Derivative Complaint (the  Consolidated Complaint ) on March 8, 2016.  The Consolidated Complaint alleges claims that Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A., its subsidiary Beltline Road Insurance Agency, Inc. and other defendants aided and abetted alleged breaches of fiduciary duties by Ocwen Financial Corporation officers and directors and/or were unjustly enriched in connection with business dealings with Ocwen Financial Corporation.  The Consolidated Complaint also seeks contribution from Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A., its subsidiary Beltline Road Insurance Agency, Inc. and other defendants for amounts Ocwen Financial Corporation paid in connection with a settlement with the New York State Department of Financial Services.  Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. and Beltline Road Insurance Agency, Inc. filed motions to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint on May 13, 2016 and intend to vigorously defend the lawsuit.  The Court disclosed that the parties reached a settlement in a settlement conference on October 13, 2016. The Court docket provides that a Stipulation of Settlement is due on or before November 18, 2016, and a Final Approval Hearing will be held before the Court on January 18, 2017. 
  On March 26, 2015, Robert Moncavage, an alleged shareholder of Ocwen Financial Corporation, filed an amended shareholder derivative complaint in the Circuit Court of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit in and for Palm Beach County, Florida against Ocwen Financial Corporation (as a nominal defendant), certain of its current or former officers and directors, Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. and other companies.  The suit seeks recovery of an unspecified amount of damages for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties by the current or former Ocwen Financial Corporation officers and directors, which were allegedly aided and abetted by Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. and other defendants.  On November 9, 2015, the Court entered an order staying all proceedings in the case pending further order of the Court.  If the litigation proceeds, Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit and to move to dismiss all claims against it.

Altisource is unable to predict the outcomes of these lawsuits or reasonably estimate the potential loss, if any, arising from the suits, given that the motion to dismiss in the second case has not been adjudicated, a stay has been entered in the third case and significant legal and factual issues remain to be determined in all three cases. 
  In addition to the matters referenced above, we are involved in legal actions in the course of our business, some of which seek monetary damages.  We do not believe that the outcome of these proceedings, both individually and in the aggregate, will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Regulatory Matters 
  Periodically, we are subject to audits, examinations and investigations by federal, state and local governmental authorities and receive subpoenas, civil investigative demands or other requests for information from such governmental authorities in connection with their regulatory or investigative authority.  We are currently responding to such inquiries from governmental authorities relating to certain aspects of our business.  We believe it is premature to predict the potential outcome or to estimate any potential financial impact in connection with these inquiries.

           B. 
    Accelerated Vesting 
       
  Notwithstanding the vesting schedule provided in Section 3, Subsection A above:  
    
           (1) 
    If the Employee s employment is terminated by reason of (a) death or Disability or (b) Retirement, then the Time-Based Options shall vest and shall become immediately exercisable in full on the date of such termination;   provided  ,   however  , that the Employee s right to such accelerated vesting is subject to the requirement that the Employee has been employed with the Company for a period of at least two (2) years on the date of death or Disability, or three (3) years on the date of Retirement, unless otherwise determined by the Company in its sole discretion. 
       
           (2) 
    If the Employee s employment is terminated by reason of death or Disability, then the Ordinary Performance-Based Options and the Extraordinary Performance-Based Options shall remain outstanding, subject to vesting only upon satisfaction of the respective criteria for the vesting of such options set forth in Section 3, Subsection A above;   provided  ,   however  , that the Employee s right to such continued vesting is subject to the requirement that the Employee has been employed with the Company for a period of at least two (2) years on the date of death or Disability, unless otherwise determined by the Company in its sole discretion. 
       
           C. 
    General 
       
  The Employee shall have none of the rights of a stockholder with respect to any of the Shares subject to the Options until such Shares shall be issued in the Employee s name or the name of the Employee s designee following the exercise of the Options. 
    
           4. 
    METHOD OF OPTION EXERCISE 
       
           A. 
    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Options may be exercised by written notice to the Company at its executive offices to the attention of the Corporate Secretary of the Company (the  Secretary ).  Such notice shall state the election to exercise the Options, shall state the number of shares in respect of which it is being exercised (the  Purchased Shares ) and shall be signed by the person or persons so exercising the Options.  In no case may the Options be exercised as to less than fifty (50) Shares at any one time (or the remaining Shares then purchasable under the Options, if less than fifty (50) Shares) or for a fractional Share.  Except as provided in Section 5 below, the Options may not be exercised unless the Employee shall, at the time of the exercise, be an employee of the Company.  During the Employee s lifetime, only the Employee or the Employee s guardian or legal representative may exercise the Options.   

Page   2   of   10 

B. 
    Such notice shall be accompanied by (i) a personal check payable to the order of the Company for payment of the full purchase price of the Purchased Shares, (ii) delivery to the Company of the number of Shares duly endorsed for transfer and owned by the Employee that have an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the aggregate purchase price of the Purchased Shares or (iii) payment therefor made in such other manner as may be acceptable to the Company on such terms as may be determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the  Committee ).   Fair Market Value  shall have the meaning given to that term in the 2009 Plan.  In addition to and at the time of payment of the purchase price, the person exercising the Options shall pay to the Company the full amount of any federal and state withholding or other taxes applicable to the taxable income of such person resulting from such exercise in cash unless the Committee in its sole discretion shall permit such taxes to be paid in Shares. Such payment may also be made in the form of payroll withholding, at the election of the option holder. The Company shall issue the Shares of the said Purchased Shares as soon as practicable after receipt of the notice and all required payments by the person or persons exercising the Options as provided in Section 4, Subsection A above.  Unless the person or persons exercising the Options shall otherwise direct the Company in writing, such Shares shall be registered in the name of the person or persons so exercising the Options and shall be delivered as aforesaid to or upon the written order of the person or persons exercising the Options.   
       
           C. 
    In the event the Options shall be exercised, pursuant to Sections 3 and 5 hereof, by any person or persons other than the Employee, such notice shall be accompanied by appropriate proof of the derivative right of such person or persons to exercise the Options.  
       
           D. 
    The date of exercise of the Options shall be the date on which the notice, the documents and all payments required under this Section 4 are received by or arranged with the Secretary.  If such notice is received after the market closes, the following trading day will be considered the date of exercise.  All Shares that shall be purchased upon the exercise of the Options as provided herein shall be fully paid and non-assessable. 
       
           E. 
    The Company may require the Employee to exercise the Options electronically through the Shareworks system or any other online system pursuant to the procedures set forth therein as determined by the Company in its sole discretion. 
       
           F. 
    The Company may amend the procedures set forth in Section 4, Subsections A through E in its sole discretion.   
       
           5. 
    TERMINATION OF OPTIONS 
       
  The Options may not be exercised to any extent after termination of the Options in one of the ways, whichever first occurs, set forth below in this Section 5. 
    
           A. 
    The Options shall terminate upon the exercise of such Options in the manner provided in this Agreement and the 2009 Plan, whether or not the Shares are ultimately delivered. 
       
           B. 
    Except as may otherwise be provided in Section 5, Subsection C below for the earlier termination of the Options, the Options and all rights and obligations thereunder shall expire ten (10) years after the Grant Date;   provided, however  , that in the event that the applicable ordinary performance and/or extraordinary performance conditions are achieved prior to the tenth anniversary of the Grant Date, the Ordinary Performance-Based Options and the Extraordinary Performance-Based Options shall terminate on the earlier to occur of: (1) the third anniversary of the date the relevant performance criteria are achieved, or (2) the tenth anniversary of the Grant Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the achievement of performance conditions for the Performance-Based Options only will not extend the life of the Extraordinary Performance-Based Options beyond the tenth anniversary of the date of this Agreement. For the further avoidance of doubt, in the event of an employment termination described  

Page   3   of   10 

in Section 5, Subsection C below, all Options shall terminate on the dates detailed in Section 5, Subsection C, regardless of whether ordinary performance conditions or extraordinary performance conditions have been achieved. 
    
           C. 
    If, prior to exercise, expiration, surrender or cancellation of the Options, the Employee s employment terminates, the Options shall terminate in accordance with the 2009 Plan except as follows: 
       
           (1) 
    by reason of Disability, then the Options shall terminate not later than (a) five (5) years after the date of such termination of employment or (b) the end of the Option s term, whichever occurs first.  In the event of the death of the Employee after such termination of employment, the Options shall terminate on the earlier to occur of: (i) three (3) years after the date of the Employee s death; or (ii) the end of the Option s term, during which period the Options may be exercised by the person or persons to whom the Employee s rights shall pass by will or by the applicable laws of descent or distribution. 
       
           (2) 
    by reason of death, then the Options shall terminate no later than (a) three (3) years after the date of the Employee s death or (b) the end of the Option s term, whichever occurs first, during which period the Options may be exercised at any time by the person or persons to whom the Employee s rights shall pass by will or by the applicable laws of descent or distribution.  
       
           (3) 
    by reason of termination of employment by the Company for Cause, then all Options shall terminate on such date of termination of employment. 
       
           (4) 
    by reason of termination of employment by the Employee (subject to Section 5, Subsection C(5) below with respect to Retirement), then all unvested Options shall terminate on such date of termination of employment and all vested Options shall terminate on the date that is six (6) months after the date of such termination of employment.  
       
           (5) 
    by reason of termination of employment by the Company without Cause or Retirement of the Employee, then if the respective performance criteria for Ordinary Performance-Based Options or Extraordinary Performance-Based Options have been satisfied on or prior to the ninety (90) day anniversary of the date of such termination of employment, such Ordinary Performance-Based Options or Extraordinary Performance-Based Options, as applicable, shall terminate on the later of (x) the six (6) month anniversary of the date such Option vests, or (y) the six (6) month anniversary of the date of such termination of employment, and (ii) if the respective performance criteria for such Ordinary Performance-Based Options or Extraordinary Performance-Based Options have not been satisfied on or prior to the ninety (90) day anniversary of the date of such termination of employment, such Ordinary Performance-Based Options or Extraordinary Performance-Based Options, as applicable, shall terminate on the ninety (90) day anniversary of the date of termination of employment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the respective performance criteria for the Ordinary Performance-Based Options or the Extraordinary Performance Based Options have been satisfied on or prior to the ninety (90) day anniversary of the date of such termination of employment, the Company will have the right in its sole discretion to require the Employee to exercise all or part of such Ordinary Performance-Based Options or such Extraordinary Performance-Based Options at any time. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall this Section 5, Subsection C(4) extend the life of the Options beyond the Option term as set forth in Section 2 of this Agreement. 
       
           D. 
    The Employee s right to retain any Options following termination of employment under this Section 5 is subject in all cases to the requirement that the Employee has been employed with the Company for a period of at least two (2) years on the date of such termination of employment, or three (3) years in the case of Retirement, unless otherwise determined by the Company in its sole discretion.

    CONDITIONS UPON TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT 
       
           A. 
    For a period of two (2) years following the Employee s departure from the Company, the Employee shall not (A) engage, either directly or indirectly, in any manner or capacity as advisor, principal, agent, partner, officer, director, employee, member of any association or otherwise, in any business or activity which is at the time competitive with any business or activity conducted by the Company, (B) solicit, directly or indirectly, any employee of the Company to leave the employ of the Company for employment, hire or engagement as an independent contractor elsewhere, (C) in any way interfere with the relationship between any customer, supplier, licensee or business relation of the Company or (D)  share, reveal or utilize any Confidential Information of the Company except as otherwise expressly permitted by Company. 
       
           B. 
    For a period of two (2) years following the Employee s departure from the Company, the Employee shall be available at reasonable times for consultations at the request of the Company s management with respect to phases of the business with which the Employee was actively connected during the Employee s employment, but such consultations shall not be required to be performed during usual vacation periods or periods of illness or other incapacity or without reasonable compensation and cost reimbursement.   
       
           C. 
    The Employee acknowledges that the Company would not have awarded the Options granted to the Employee under this Agreement absent the Employee s agreement to be bound by the covenants made in this Section 6.  
       
           D. 
    In the event that the Employee fails to comply with any of the promises made in this Section 6, then in addition to and not in limitation of any and all other remedies available to the Company at law or in equity (a) the Options, to the extent then unexercised, whether vested or unvested, will be immediately forfeited and cancelled and (b) the Employee will be required to immediately deliver to the Company an amount (in cash or in Shares) equal to the market value (on the date of exercise) of any Shares acquired on exercise of the Options less the exercise price paid for such Shares (the  Share Value ) to the extent such Shares were acquired by the Employee upon exercise of the Options at any time from 180 days prior to the earlier of (i) the date of termination of employment or (ii) the date the Employee fails to comply with any promise made in this Section 6, to 180 days after the date when the Company learns that the Employee has not complied with any such promise. The Employee will deliver such Share Value amount (either in cash or in Shares) to the Company on such terms and conditions as may be required by the Company. The Company will be entitled to enforce this repayment obligation by all legal means available, including, without limitation, to set off the Share Value amount and any other damage amount against any amount that might be owed to the Employee by the Company.  
       
           E. 
    The Employee further acknowledges that in the event that the covenants made in this Section 6 are not fulfilled, the damage to the Company would be irreparable. The Company, in addition to any other remedies available to it, including, without limitation, the remedies set forth in Sections 6, Subsection (D) above, shall be entitled to injunctive relief against the Employee s breach or threatened breach of said covenants.  
       
           F. 
    Any determination by the Board of Directors with regard to Section 6, Subsections (D) and (E) shall be conclusive. 
       
           7. 
    ADJUSTMENT UPON CHANGES IN STOCK; CHANGE OF CONTROL/RESTRUCTURING EVENT 
       
           A. 
    Except to the extent governed by Section 7, Subsection (B) below, if there shall be any change in the Shares subject to the Options granted hereunder, through merger, consolidation, reorganization,  

Page   5   of   10 

recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, spin off of one or more subsidiaries or other change in the corporate structure, appropriate adjustments shall be made by the Board of Directors in its discretion (or if the Company is not the surviving company in any such transaction, the Board of Directors of the surviving company   with the Board of Directors of the Company and the surviving company collectively referred to in this Section 7 as the  Board ) in the aggregate number and kind of shares subject to the 2009 Plan and the number and kind of shares and the price per share subject to the Options. Further, the Board shall adjust the ordinary performance conditions and extraordinary performance conditions as appropriate to avoid inequitable dilution or enlargement of award values or rights in connection with such a corporate transaction or restructuring.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event of a restructuring or transaction resulting in some or all of the Company s Shares being convertible into equity of a separate company, the Board shall have the authority to replace outstanding Options with any one or more of the following: (A) adjusted options of the Company; (B) adjusted options on the equity of the separate company; and (C) a combination of adjusted options on the shares of both the Company and the separate company, all as the Board sees as equitable. In the event of any such option adjustment and/or conversion, the Board shall attempt to reasonably approximate the aggregate value of the Employee s outstanding Options under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event Employee remains employed with the separate company that results from a restructuring or transaction covered by this Section 7, for purposes of this Agreement, the Employee will be deemed to remain employed as if the Employee continued employment with the Company such that the employment termination provisions applicable to Options shall not be invoked unless and until the Employee s employment with such separate company shall terminate. 
    
           B. 
    If a Change of Control/Restructuring Event occurs, the acquiring person or entity shall have the right to cancel the Options in exchange for a payment equal to the then intrinsic value of the Options as determined by the Board, effective as of the Change of Control/Restructuring Date, or to allow the Options to continue in full force and effect in accordance with the terms hereof. If the Options are to remain in place following such Change of Control/Restructuring Event, the Board shall have the right in its discretion to make appropriate adjustments in the aggregate number and kind of Shares and the price per Share subject to the Options. Further, the Board shall adjust the ordinary performance conditions and extraordinary performance conditions as appropriate to avoid inequitable dilution or enlargement of award values or rights in connection with such Change of Control/Restructuring Event.  Such discretions shall include the authority to replace outstanding Options with any one or more of the following: (a) adjusted options of the Company; (b) adjusted options on the equity of any separate company surviving such Change of Control/Restructuring event; and (c) a combination of adjusted options on the shares of both the Company and the separate company, as such Board sees as equitable. In the event of any such option adjustment and/or conversion, such Board shall attempt to reasonably approximate the aggregate value of the Employee s outstanding Options under this Agreement. 
       
           C. 
    The 2009 Plan and Agreement and the awards granted hereunder shall not affect the right of the Company to reclassify, recapitalize, issue equity or otherwise change its capital or debt structure or to merge, consolidate, convey any or all of its assets, dissolve, liquidate, wind up or otherwise reorganize. The Board of Directors shall have the discretion to make adjustments to the awards made hereunder to reflect any changes that the Board of Directors deems appropriate as a result of any sale, an IPO, business combination, acquisition, recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation, reorganization, stock dividend, stock split, spin off of one or more divisions or subsidiaries, a  going private  transaction (which shall mean any transaction that results in the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) Altisource s common stock is no longer listed on any national securities exchange or quoted on the Nasdaq National Market or other securities quotation system; (ii) Altisource is no longer subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act; or (iii) Altisource becomes subject to Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act) or similar transaction affecting the awards. Upon the occurrence of any such events, the Board of Directors may make appropriate adjustments to the awards made hereunder to avoid inequitable dilution or enlargement of award

values or rights in connection with any such event (as determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion based on any facts and circumstances it considers relevant). For the avoidance of doubt, the awards are subject to the dilutive impact of equity issuances (including an IPO) or other costs of capital made in connection with acquisitions or capital raises. 
    
           8.

    As used herein, a  Change of Control/Restructuring Event  shall mean (i) the acquisition by any person or entity, or two or more persons and/or entities acting in concert, of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), of outstanding shares of voting stock of the Company at any time if after giving effect to such acquisition, and as a result of such acquisition, such person(s) or entity(ies) own more than fifty percent (50%) of such outstanding voting stock, (ii) the sale in one or more transactions of substantially all of the Company s assets to any person or entity, or two or more persons and/or entities acting in concert, or (iii) the merger, consolidation or similar transaction resulting in a

reduction of the interest in the Company s stock of the pre-transaction stockholders to less than fifty percent (50%) of the post-transaction ownership. To the extent the Employee s employment agreement conflicts with the Change of Control/Restructuring Event definition set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, the Employee s employment agreement will govern.

              G. 
    As used herein, the term  Retirement  shall mean termination (other than by reason of death or Disability) of the Employee s employment with the Company or one of its subsidiaries pursuant to and in accordance with a plan or program of the Company or subsidiary applicable to the Employee provided, however, that for purposes of this Agreement only, the Employee must have attained the age of sixty (60) and been an employee of the Company for not less than three (3) years as of  the date of termination of employment by reason of Retirement. 
        
  In the event that the Board of Directors shall amend the 2009 Plan under the provisions of Section 9 of the 2009 Plan and such amendment shall modify or otherwise affect the subject matter of this Agreement, this Agreement shall, to that extent, be deemed to be amended by such amendment to the 2009 Plan.  The Company shall notify the Employee in writing of any such amendment to the 2009 Plan and this Agreement as soon as practicable after its approval. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the 2009 Plan, the Employee s Options under this Agreement may not be amended in a way that materially diminishes the value of the Options without the Employee s consent to the amendment. 

In the event of any conflict between the 2009 Plan and this Agreement, the provisions of the 2009 Plan shall control.  This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Georgia.  No provision of this Agreement  

Page   8   of   10 

shall limit in any way whatsoever any right that the Company may otherwise have to terminate the employment of the Employee at any time. 
    
  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, then this provision will be deemed amended to the extent necessary to render the otherwise unenforceable provision, and the rest of the Agreement, valid and enforceable. If a court declines to amend this Agreement as provided herein, the invalidity or unenforceability of any particular provision thereof shall not affect the other provisions hereof, and this Agreement shall be construed in all respects as if such invalid or unenforceable provision had been omitted. 

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Company and the Employee and supersedes all other discussions, correspondence, representations, understandings and agreements between the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof. 

The headings of the sections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed a part hereof.

           B. 
    Accelerated Vesting 
       
  Notwithstanding the vesting schedule provided in Section 3, Subsection A above:  
    
           (1) 
    If the Employee s employment is terminated by reason of (a) death or Disability or (b) Retirement, then the Time-Based Options shall vest and shall become immediately exercisable in full on the date of such termination;   provided  ,   however  , that the Employee s right to such accelerated vesting is subject to the requirement that the Employee has been employed with the Company for a period of at least two (2) years on the date of death or Disability, or three (3) years on the date of Retirement, unless otherwise determined by the Company in its sole discretion.

           C. 
    General 
       
  The Employee shall have none of the rights of a stockholder with respect to any of the Shares subject to the Options until such Shares shall be issued in the Employee s name or the name of the Employee s designee following the exercise of the Options. 
    
           4. 
    METHOD OF OPTION EXERCISE 
       
           A. 
    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Options may be exercised by written notice to the Company at its executive offices to the attention of the Corporate Secretary of the Company (the  Secretary ).  Such notice shall state the election to exercise the Options, shall state the number of shares in respect of which it is being exercised (the  Purchased Shares ) and shall be signed by the person or persons so exercising the Options.  In no case may the Options be exercised as to less than fifty (50) Shares at any one time (or the remaining Shares then purchasable under the Options, if less than fifty (50) Shares) or for a fractional Share.  Except as provided in Section 5 below, the Options may not be exercised unless the Employee shall, at the time of the exercise, be an employee of the Company.  During the Employee s lifetime, only the Employee or the Employee s guardian or legal representative may exercise the Options.   

Page   2   of   10 

B. 
    Such notice shall be accompanied by (i) a personal check payable to the order of the Company for payment of the full purchase price of the Purchased Shares, (ii) delivery to the Company of the number of Shares duly endorsed for transfer and owned by the Employee that have an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the aggregate purchase price of the Purchased Shares or (iii) payment therefor made in such other manner as may be acceptable to the Company on such terms as may be determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the  Committee ).   Fair Market Value  shall have the meaning given to that term in the 2009 Plan.  In addition to and at the time of payment of the purchase price, the person exercising the Options shall pay to the Company the full amount of any federal and state withholding or other taxes applicable to the taxable income of such person resulting from such exercise in cash unless the Committee in its sole discretion shall permit such taxes to be paid in Shares. Such payment may also be made in the form of payroll withholding, at the election of the option holder. The Company shall issue the Shares of the said Purchased Shares as soon as practicable after receipt of the notice and all required payments by the person or persons exercising the Options as provided in Section 4, Subsection A above.  Unless the person or persons exercising the Options shall otherwise direct the Company in writing, such Shares shall be registered in the name of the person or persons so exercising the Options and shall be delivered as aforesaid to or upon the written order of the person or persons exercising the Options.   
       
           C. 
    In the event the Options shall be exercised, pursuant to Sections 3 and 5 hereof, by any person or persons other than the Employee, such notice shall be accompanied by appropriate proof of the derivative right of such person or persons to exercise the Options.  
       
           D. 
    The date of exercise of the Options shall be the date on which the notice, the documents and all payments required under this Section 4 are received by or arranged with the Secretary.  If such notice is received after the market closes, the following trading day will be considered the date of exercise.  All Shares that shall be purchased upon the exercise of the Options as provided herein shall be fully paid and non-assessable. 
       
           E. 
    The Company may require the Employee to exercise the Options electronically through the Shareworks system or any other online system pursuant to the procedures set forth therein as determined by the Company in its sole discretion. 
       
           F. 
    The Company may amend the procedures set forth in Section 4, Subsections A through E in its sole discretion.   
       
           5. 
    TERMINATION OF OPTIONS 
       
  The Options may not be exercised to any extent after termination of the Options in one of the ways, whichever first occurs, set forth below in this Section 5. 
    
           A. 
    The Options shall terminate upon the exercise of such Options in the manner provided in this Agreement and the 2009 Plan, whether or not the Shares are ultimately delivered. 
       
           B. 
    Except as may otherwise be provided in Section 5, Subsection C below for the earlier termination of the Options, the Options and all rights and obligations thereunder shall expire ten (10) years after the Grant Date;   provided, however  , that in the event that the applicable ordinary performance and/or extraordinary performance conditions are achieved prior to the tenth anniversary of the Grant Date, the Ordinary Performance-Based Options and the Extraordinary Performance-Based Options shall terminate on the earlier to occur of: (1) the third anniversary of the date the relevant performance criteria are achieved, or (2) the tenth anniversary of the Grant Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the achievement of performance conditions for the Performance-Based Options only will not extend the life of the Extraordinary Performance-Based Options beyond the tenth anniversary of the date of this Agreement. For the further avoidance of doubt, in the event of an employment termination described  

Page   3   of   10 

in Section 5, Subsection C below, all Options shall terminate on the dates detailed in Section 5, Subsection C, regardless of whether ordinary performance conditions or extraordinary performance conditions have been achieved. 
    
           C. 
    If, prior to exercise, expiration, surrender or cancellation of the Options, the Employee s employment terminates, the Options shall terminate in accordance with the 2009 Plan except as follows: 
       
           (1) 
    by reason of Disability, then the Options shall terminate not later than (a) five (5) years after the date of such termination of employment or (b) the end of the Option s term, whichever occurs first.  In the event of the death of the Employee after such termination of employment, the Options shall terminate on the earlier to occur of: (i) three (3) years after the date of the Employee s death; or (ii) the end of the Option s term, during which period the Options may be exercised by the person or persons to whom the Employee s rights shall pass by will or by the applicable laws of descent or distribution. 
       
           (2) 
    by reason of death, then the Options shall terminate no later than (a) three (3) years after the date of the Employee s death or (b) the end of the Option s term, whichever occurs first, during which period the Options may be exercised at any time by the person or persons to whom the Employee s rights shall pass by will or by the applicable laws of descent or distribution.  
       
           (3) 
    by reason of termination of employment by the Company for Cause, then all Options shall terminate on such date of termination of employment. 
       
           (4) 
    by reason of termination of employment by the Employee (subject to Section 5, Subsection C(5) below with respect to Retirement), then all unvested Options shall terminate on such date of termination of employment and all vested Options shall terminate on the date that is six (6) months after the date of such termination of employment.  
       
           (5) 
    by reason of termination of employment by the Company without Cause or Retirement of the Employee, then if the respective performance criteria for Ordinary Performance-Based Options or Extraordinary Performance-Based Options have been satisfied on or prior to the ninety (90) day anniversary of the date of such termination of employment, such Ordinary Performance-Based Options or Extraordinary Performance-Based Options, as applicable, shall terminate on the later of (x) the six (6) month anniversary of the date such Option vests, or (y) the six (6) month anniversary of the date of such termination of employment, and (ii) if the respective performance criteria for such Ordinary Performance-Based Options or Extraordinary Performance-Based Options have not been satisfied on or prior to the ninety (90) day anniversary of the date of such termination of employment, such Ordinary Performance-Based Options or Extraordinary Performance-Based Options, as applicable, shall terminate on the ninety (90) day anniversary of the date of termination of employment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the respective performance criteria for the Ordinary Performance-Based Options or the Extraordinary Performance Based Options have been satisfied on or prior to the ninety (90) day anniversary of the date of such termination of employment, the Company will have the right in its sole discretion to require the Employee to exercise all or part of such Ordinary Performance-Based Options or such Extraordinary Performance-Based Options at any time. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall this Section 5, Subsection C(4) extend the life of the Options beyond the Option term as set forth in Section 2 of this Agreement. 
       
           D. 
    The Employee s right to retain any Options following termination of employment under this Section 5 is subject in all cases to the requirement that the Employee has been employed with the Company for a period of at least two (2) years on the date of such termination of employment, or three (3) years in the case of Retirement, unless otherwise determined by the Company in its sole discretion.

6. 
    CONDITIONS UPON TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT 
       
           A. 
    For a period of two (2) years following the Employee s departure from the Company, the Employee shall not (A) engage, either directly or indirectly, in any manner or capacity as advisor, principal, agent, partner, officer, director, employee, member of any association or otherwise, in any business or activity which is at the time competitive with any business or activity conducted by the Company, (B) solicit, directly or indirectly, any employee of the Company to leave the employ of the Company for employment, hire or engagement as an independent contractor elsewhere, (C) in any way interfere with the relationship between any customer, supplier, licensee or business relation of the Company or (D)  share, reveal or utilize any Confidential Information of the Company except as otherwise expressly permitted by Company. 
       
           B. 
    For a period of two (2) years following the Employee s departure from the Company, the Employee shall be available at reasonable times for consultations at the request of the Company s management with respect to phases of the business with which the Employee was actively connected during the Employee s employment, but such consultations shall not be required to be performed during usual vacation periods or periods of illness or other incapacity or without reasonable compensation and cost reimbursement.   
       
           C. 
    The Employee acknowledges that the Company would not have awarded the Options granted to the Employee under this Agreement absent the Employee s agreement to be bound by the covenants made in this Section 6.  
       
           D. 
    In the event that the Employee fails to comply with any of the promises made in this Section 6, then in addition to and not in limitation of any and all other remedies available to the Company at law or in equity (a) the Options, to the extent then unexercised, whether vested or unvested, will be immediately forfeited and cancelled and (b) the Employee will be required to immediately deliver to the Company an amount (in cash or in Shares) equal to the market value (on the date of exercise) of any Shares acquired on exercise of the Options less the exercise price paid for such Shares (the  Share Value ) to the extent such Shares were acquired by the Employee upon exercise of the Options at any time from 180 days prior to the earlier of (i) the date of termination of employment or (ii) the date the Employee fails to comply with any promise made in this Section 6, to 180 days after the date when the Company learns that the Employee has not complied with any such promise. The Employee will deliver such Share Value amount (either in cash or in Shares) to the Company on such terms and conditions as may be required by the Company. The Company will be entitled to enforce this repayment obligation by all legal means available, including, without limitation, to set off the Share Value amount and any other damage amount against any amount that might be owed to the Employee by the Company.  
       
           E. 
    The Employee further acknowledges that in the event that the covenants made in this Section 6 are not fulfilled, the damage to the Company would be irreparable. The Company, in addition to any other remedies available to it, including, without limitation, the remedies set forth in Sections 6, Subsection (D) above, shall be entitled to injunctive relief against the Employee s breach or threatened breach of said covenants.  
       
           F. 
    Any determination by the Board of Directors with regard to Section 6, Subsections (D) and (E) shall be conclusive. 
       
           7. 
    ADJUSTMENT UPON CHANGES IN STOCK; CHANGE OF CONTROL/RESTRUCTURING EVENT 
       
           A. 
    Except to the extent governed by Section 7, Subsection (B) below, if there shall be any change in the Shares subject to the Options granted hereunder, through merger, consolidation, reorganization,  

Page   5   of   10 

recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, spin off of one or more subsidiaries or other change in the corporate structure, appropriate adjustments shall be made by the Board of Directors in its discretion (or if the Company is not the surviving company in any such transaction, the Board of Directors of the surviving company   with the Board of Directors of the Company and the surviving company collectively referred to in this Section 7 as the  Board ) in the aggregate number and kind of shares subject to the 2009 Plan and the number and kind of shares and the price per share subject to the Options. Further, the Board shall adjust the ordinary performance conditions and extraordinary performance conditions as appropriate to avoid inequitable dilution or enlargement of award values or rights in connection with such a corporate transaction or restructuring.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event of a restructuring or transaction resulting in some or all of the Company s Shares being convertible into equity of a separate company, the Board shall have the authority to replace outstanding Options with any one or more of the following: (A) adjusted options of the Company; (B) adjusted options on the equity of the separate company; and (C) a combination of adjusted options on the shares of both the Company and the separate company, all as the Board sees as equitable. In the event of any such option adjustment and/or conversion, the Board shall attempt to reasonably approximate the aggregate value of the Employee s outstanding Options under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event Employee remains employed with the separate company that results from a restructuring or transaction covered by this Section 7, for purposes of this Agreement, the Employee will be deemed to remain employed as if the Employee continued employment with the Company such that the employment termination provisions applicable to Options shall not be invoked unless and until the Employee s employment with such separate company shall terminate. 
    
           B. 
    If a Change of Control/Restructuring Event occurs, the acquiring person or entity shall have the right to cancel the Options in exchange for a payment equal to the then intrinsic value of the Options as determined by the Board, effective as of the Change of Control/Restructuring Date, or to allow the Options to continue in full force and effect in accordance with the terms hereof. If the Options are to remain in place following such Change of Control/Restructuring Event, the Board shall have the right in its discretion to make appropriate adjustments in the aggregate number and kind of Shares and the price per Share subject to the Options. Further, the Board shall adjust the ordinary performance conditions and extraordinary performance conditions as appropriate to avoid inequitable dilution or enlargement of award values or rights in connection with such Change of Control/Restructuring Event.  Such discretions shall include the authority to replace outstanding Options with any one or more of the following: (a) adjusted options of the Company; (b) adjusted options on the equity of any separate company surviving such Change of Control/Restructuring event; and (c) a combination of adjusted options on the shares of both the Company and the separate company, as such Board sees as equitable. In the event of any such option adjustment and/or conversion, such Board shall attempt to reasonably approximate the aggregate value of the Employee s outstanding Options under this Agreement. 
       
           C. 
    The 2009 Plan and Agreement and the awards granted hereunder shall not affect the right of the Company to reclassify, recapitalize, issue equity or otherwise change its capital or debt structure or to merge, consolidate, convey any or all of its assets, dissolve, liquidate, wind up or otherwise reorganize. The Board of Directors shall have the discretion to make adjustments to the awards made hereunder to reflect any changes that the Board of Directors deems appropriate as a result of any sale, an IPO, business combination, acquisition, recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation, reorganization, stock dividend, stock split, spin off of one or more divisions or subsidiaries, a  going private  transaction (which shall mean any transaction that results in the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) Altisource s common stock is no longer listed on any national securities exchange or quoted on the Nasdaq National Market or other securities quotation system; (ii) Altisource is no longer subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act; or (iii) Altisource becomes subject to Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act) or similar transaction affecting the awards. Upon the occurrence of any such events, the Board of Directors may make appropriate adjustments to the awards made hereunder to avoid inequitable dilution or enlargement of award  

Page   6   of   10 

values or rights in connection with any such event (as determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion based on any facts and circumstances it considers relevant). For the avoidance of doubt, the awards are subject to the dilutive impact of equity issuances (including an IPO) or other costs of capital made in connection with acquisitions or capital raises. 
    
           8. 
    NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTIONS 
       
  The Options shall not be transferable otherwise than by will or by the applicable laws of descent and distribution.  More particularly (but without limiting the generality of the foregoing), the Options may not be assigned, transferred (except as aforesaid), pledged or hypothecated in any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise) and shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process.  Any attempted assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition of the Options contrary to the provisions hereof, and the levy of any execution, attachment or similar process upon the Options, shall be null and void and without effect. 
    
           9. 
    PAYMENT OF EXPENSES AND COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS 
       
  The Company shall at all times during the term of the Options reserve and keep available such number of Shares as will be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of this Agreement, shall pay all original issue and/or transfer taxes with respect to the issue and/or transfer of Shares pursuant hereto and all other fees and expenses necessarily incurred by the Company in connection therewith and will from time to time use its best efforts to comply with all laws and regulations which, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, shall be applicable thereto.

              D. 
    As used herein, a  Change of Control/Restructuring Event  shall mean (i) the acquisition by any person or entity, or two or more persons and/or entities acting in concert, of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), of outstanding shares of voting stock of the Company at any time if after giving effect to such acquisition, and as a result of such acquisition, such person(s) or entity(ies) own more than fifty percent (50%) of such outstanding voting stock, (ii) the sale in one or more transactions of substantially all of the Company s assets to any person or entity, or two or more persons and/or entities acting in concert, or (iii) the merger, consolidation or similar transaction resulting in a  

Page   7   of   10 

reduction of the interest in the Company s stock of the pre-transaction stockholders to less than fifty percent (50%) of the post-transaction ownership. To the extent the Employee s employment agreement conflicts with the Change of Control/Restructuring Event definition set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, the Employee s employment agreement will govern.

    As used herein, the term  Disability  shall mean a physical or mental impairment which, as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors, renders the Employee unable to perform the essential functions of his employment with the Company, even with reasonable accommodation that does not impose an undue hardship on the Company, for more than one hundred and eighty (180) days in any twelve (12) month period, unless a longer period is required by federal or state law, in which case that longer period would apply.  
              G.

The Company shall notify the Employee in writing of any such amendment to the 2009 Plan and this Agreement as soon as practicable after its approval. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the 2009 Plan, the Employee s Options under this Agreement may not be amended in a way that materially diminishes the value of the Options without the Employee s consent to the amendment. 

In the event of any conflict between the 2009 Plan and this Agreement, the provisions of the 2009 Plan shall control.  This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Georgia.  No provision of this Agreement  

Page   8   of   10 

shall limit in any way whatsoever any right that the Company may otherwise have to terminate the employment of the Employee at any time. 
    
  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, then this provision will be deemed amended to the extent necessary to render the otherwise unenforceable provision, and the rest of the Agreement, valid and enforceable. If a court declines to amend this Agreement as provided herein, the invalidity or unenforceability of any particular provision thereof shall not affect the other provisions hereof, and this Agreement shall be construed in all respects as if such invalid or unenforceable provision had been omitted. 

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Company and the Employee and supersedes all other discussions, correspondence, representations, understandings and agreements between the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof. 

The headings of the sections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed a part hereof. 
    
           15.
