  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements 
   
  Note 1   Basis of Presentation 
  The consolidated financial statements are comprised of the accounts of Northfield Bancorp, Inc. (the Company) and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Northfield Investments, Inc. and Northfield Bank (the Bank), and the Bank s wholly-owned significant subsidiaries, NSB Services Corp. and NSB Realty Trust. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting solely of normal and recurring adjustments) necessary for the fair presentation of the consolidated financial condition and the consolidated results of operations for the unaudited periods presented have been included.  The results of operations and other data presented for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  .  Whenever necessary, certain prior year amounts are reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 
  In preparing the unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated statements of financial condition and results of operations for the periods indicated.  Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to change are: the allowance for loan losses, the evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets, impairment on investment securities, fair value measurements of assets and liabilities, and income taxes.  Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are deemed necessary. While management uses its best judgment, actual amounts or results could differ significantly from those estimates. 
    
  Certain information and note disclosures usually included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the preparation of interim financial statements.  The consolidated financial statements presented should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , of Northfield Bancorp, Inc. as filed with the SEC.  

Note 2   Business Combinations 
    On January 8, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of Hopewell Valley Community Bank ( Hopewell Valley ), which after purchase accounting adjustments added   $508.5 million   to total assets,   $342.6 million   to loans, and   $456.2 million   to deposits, and   nine   branch offices in the Hunterdon and Mercer counties of New Jersey.  Total consideration paid for Hopewell Valley was   $55.4 million  , consisting of   $13.7 million   in cash and   2,707,381   shares of common stock valued at   $41.7 million   based upon the   $15.41   per share closing price of Northfield Bancorp, Inc.'s common stock on January 8, 2016.   
    
  The transaction was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting.  Under this method of accounting, the purchase price has been allocated to the respective assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values, net of tax. The excess of consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill.

  NORTHFIELD BANCORP, INC. 
  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued) 

The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition for Hopewell Valley (in thousands): 

The calculation of goodwill is subject to change for up to one year after the date of acquisition as additional information relative to the closing date estimates and uncertainties become available.  As the Company finalizes its review of the acquired assets and liabilities, certain adjustments to the recorded carrying values may be required.  
    
  Fair Value Measurement of Assets Assumed and Liabilities Assumed  
    
  The methods used to determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Hopewell Valley acquisition were as follows:  
    
  Cash and cash equivalents 
    
  The estimated fair values of cash and cash equivalents approximate their stated face amounts, as these financial instruments are either due on demand or have short-term maturities.  
    
  Securities Available-for-Sale  
    
  The estimated fair values of the investment securities classified as available-for-sale were calculated utilizing Level 1 and Level 2 inputs.  Management reviewed the data and assumptions used by its third party provider in pricing the securities to ensure the highest level of significant inputs is derived from observable market data.  These prices were validated against other pricing sources and broker-dealer indications.  
    
  Loans    
  The acquired loan portfolio was valued based on current guidance which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  Level 3 inputs were utilized to value the portfolio and included the use of present value techniques employing cash flow estimates and the incorporated assumptions that marketplace participants would use in estimating fair values.  In instances where reliable market information was not available, the Company used its own assumptions in an effort to determine reasonable fair value.  Specifically, management utilized three separate fair value analyses which a market participant would employ in estimating the total fair value adjustment.  The three separate fair valuation methodologies used were: 1) interest rate loan fair value analysis; 2) general credit fair value adjustment; and 3) specific credit fair value adjustment.

     Table of Contents  
  NORTHFIELD BANCORP, INC. 
  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued) 

To prepare the interest rate fair value analysis, loans were grouped by characteristics such as loan type, term, collateral and rate. Market rates for similar loans were obtained from various external data sources and reviewed by Company management for reasonableness.  The average of these rates was used as the fair value interest rate a market participant would utilize.  A present value approach was utilized to calculate the interest rate fair value adjustment.  
    
  The general credit fair value adjustment was calculated using a two part general credit fair value analysis: 1) expected lifetime losses; and 2) estimated fair value adjustment for qualitative factors.  The expected lifetime losses were calculated using an average of historical losses of the Company, the acquired bank and peer banks.  The adjustment related to qualitative factors was impacted by general economic conditions and the risk related to lack of familiarity with the originator's underwriting process.  
    
  To calculate the specific credit fair value adjustment, management reviewed the acquired loan portfolio for loans meeting the definition of an impaired loan with deteriorated credit quality.  Loans meeting this definition were reviewed by comparing the contractual cash flows to expected collectible cash flows.  The aggregate expected cash flows less the acquisition date fair value resulted in an accretable yield amount.  The accretable yield amount will be recognized over the life of the loans on a level yield basis as an adjustment to yield.  
    
  Other intangible assets 
    
  Other intangible assets consisting of core deposit premium represents the value assigned to demand, interest checking, money market and savings accounts acquired as part of an acquisition.  The core deposit premium value represents the future economic benefit, including the present value of future tax benefits, of the potential cost savings from acquiring core deposits as part of an acquisition compared to the cost of alternative funding sources.  The core deposit premium is being amortized over an estimated useful life of   10 years   to approximate the existing deposit relationships acquired.  
    
  Deposits  
    
  The fair values of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., non-interest bearing demand accounts, interest-bearing negotiable orders of withdrawal (NOW), savings and money market accounts) are equal to the carrying amounts payable on demand.  The fair values of certificates of deposit represent contractual cash flows, discounted to present value using interest rates currently offered on deposits with similar characteristics and remaining maturities.  
    
  Other borrowings 
    
  Other borrowings consist of securities sold under agreements to repurchase.  The carrying amounts approximate their fair values because they frequently re-price to a market rate.

The following is a summary of the expected maturity distribution of debt securities available-for-sale, other than mortgage-backed securities, at   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 

Contractual maturities for mortgage-backed securities are not included above, as expected maturities on mortgage-backed securities may differ from contractual maturities as borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without penalties. 
    
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company had gross proceeds of   $525,000   and   $42.8 million  , respectively, on sales of securities available-for-sale, with gross realized gains of approximately   $18,000   and   $352,000  , and gross realized losses of approximately   $1,000   and   $129,000  , for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company had gross proceeds of   $11.9 million    and   $51.1 million  , respectively, on sales of securities available-for-sale, with gross realized gains of approximately   $13,000   and   $59,000  , respectively, and gross realized losses of   $0   and   $3,000  , for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  The Company recognized net gains of   $345,000   and   $389,000  , on its trading securities portfolio during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  The Company recognized net losses of   $401,000  , and   $390,000  , on its trading securities portfolio during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  The Company did not recognize any other-than-temporary impairment charges during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , or   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Gross unrealized losses on mortgage-backed and other debt securities available-for-sale, and the estimated fair value of the related securities, aggregated by security category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , were as follows (in thousands):

     Table of Contents  
  NORTHFIELD BANCORP, INC. 
  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued) 

The Company held   thirteen   pass-through mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by GSEs,   eight   REMIC mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by GSEs, and   two   REMIC mortgage-backed securities not issued or guaranteed by GSEs that were in a continuous unrealized loss position of twelve months or greater at   September 30, 2016  .  There were   10   pass-through mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by GSEs,   three   REMIC mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by a GSE,   one   municipal bond, and   one   corporate bond that were in an unrealized loss position of less than twelve months at   September 30, 2016  .  All securities referred to above were rated investment grade at   September 30, 2016  .  The declines in value relate to the general interest rate environment and are considered temporary.  The securities cannot be prepaid in a manner that would result in the Company not receiving substantially all of its amortized cost.  The Company neither has an intent to sell, nor is it more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell, the securities before the recovery of their amortized cost basis or, if necessary, maturity. 
    
  The fair values of our investment securities could decline in the future if the underlying performance of the collateral for the collateralized mortgage obligations or other securities deteriorates and our credit enhancement levels do not provide sufficient protections to our contractual principal and interest, which may result in other-than-temporary impairment in the future.     

Note 4   Securities Held-to-Maturity 
  The following is a summary of mortgage-backed securities held-to-maturity at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands):

Contractual maturities for mortgage-backed securities are not presented, as expected maturities on mortgage backed securities may differ from contractual maturities as borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without penalties.  There were   no   sales of held-to-maturity securities for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , or   September 30, 2015  .  The Company had   no   held-to-maturity securities at   September 30, 2016  , that were in an unrealized loss position.   
    
  Gross unrealized losses on mortgage-backed securities held-to-maturity, and the estimated fair value of the related securities, aggregated by security category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, at   December 31, 2015  , were as follows (in thousands): 

The fair values of our investment securities could decline in the future if the underlying performance of the collateral for the collateralized mortgage obligations or other securities deteriorates and our credit enhancement levels do not provide sufficient protections to our contractual principal and interest.  As a result, there is a risk that significant other-than-temporary impairments may occur in the future given the current economic environment.

Note 5   Loans 
    
  Net loans held-for-investment are as follows (in thousands): 

PCI loans totaled   $32.8 million   at   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $33.1 million   at   December 31, 2015   and included   $4.9 million   of loans acquired as part of the Hopewell Valley acquisition.  The remaining balance of PCI loans is primarily attributable to those acquired as part of an FDIC-assisted transaction.  The Company accounts for PCI loans utilizing U.S. GAAP applicable to loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality.  At   September 30, 2016  , PCI loans consist of approximately   36.5%   commercial real estate loans and   44.0%   commercial and industrial loans, with the remaining balance in residential and home equity loans.  At December 31, 2015, PCI loans consist of approximately   27.9%   commercial real estate loans and   52.4%   commercial and industrial loans, with the remaining balance in residential and home equity loans.   
    
  The following table sets forth information regarding the estimates of the contractually required payments, the cash flows expected to be collected, and the estimated fair value of the PCI loans acquired from Hopewell Valley at January 8, 2016 (in thousands):

The Company monitors the credit quality of its loan portfolio on a regular basis.  Credit quality is monitored by reviewing certain credit quality indicators.  Management has determined that loan-to-value ratios (at period end) and internally assigned credit risk ratings by loan type are the key credit quality indicators that best measure the credit quality of the Company s loan receivables.  Loan-to-value (LTV) ratios used by management in monitoring credit quality are based on current period loan balances and original appraised values at time of origination (unless a current appraisal has been obtained as a result of the loan being deemed impaired).  In calculating the provision for loan losses, based on past loan loss experience, management has determined that commercial real estate loans and multifamily loans having loan-to-value ratios, as described above, of less than   35%  , and one-to-four family loans having loan-to-value ratios, as described above, of less than   60%  , require less of a loss factor than those with higher loan to value ratios. 
    
  The Company maintains a credit risk rating system as part of the risk assessment of its loan portfolio. The Company s lending officers are required to assign a credit risk rating to each loan in their portfolio at origination. This risk rating is reviewed periodically and adjusted if necessary.  Monthly, management presents monitored assets to the loan committee. In addition, the Company engages a third-party independent loan reviewer that performs semi-annual reviews of a sample of loans, validating the credit risk ratings assigned to such loans. The credit risk ratings play an important role in the establishment of the loan loss provision and the allowance for loan losses for originated loans held-for-investment. After determining the general reserve loss factor for each originated portfolio segment held-for-investment, the originated portfolio segment held-for-investment balance collectively evaluated for impairment is multiplied by the general reserve loss factor for the respective portfolio segment in order to determine the general reserve. 
    
  When assigning a risk rating to a loan, management utilizes the Bank s internal nine-point credit risk rating system.

    Special Mention 
              7. 
    Substandard 
         
  Loans rated 1 to 5 are considered pass ratings.  An asset is classified substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.  Substandard assets have well defined weaknesses based on objective evidence, and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.  Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable based on current circumstances.  Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets is not warranted.  Assets which do not currently expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories, but possess weaknesses, are required to be designated special mention.

Included in loans receivable are loans for which the accrual of interest income has been discontinued due to deterioration in the financial condition of the borrowers.  The recorded investment of these non-accrual loans was   $8.8 million   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  Generally, loans are placed on non-accrual status when they become   90 days   or more delinquent, or sooner if considered appropriate by management, and remain on non-accrual status until they are brought current, have six consecutive months of performance under the loan terms, and factors indicating reasonable doubt about the timely collection of payments no longer exist.  Therefore, loans may be current in accordance with their loan terms, or may be less than   90 days   delinquent and still be on a non-accruing status.     
    
  These non-accrual amounts included loans deemed to be impaired of   $7.2 million   and   $6.7 million   at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Loans on non-accrual status with principal balances less than   $500,000  , and therefore not meeting the Company s definition of an impaired loan, amounted to   $1.6 million   and   $2.1 million   at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  There were   no   loans held-for-sale at   September 30, 2016  , or   December 31, 2015  .  Loans past due   90 days   or more and still accruing interest were   $1.8 million   and   $15,000   at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and consisted of loans that are considered well secured and in the process of collection.

Included in the above table at   September 30, 2016  , are impaired loans with carrying balances of   $13.4 million   that were not written down by charge-offs or for which there are no specific reserves in our allowance for loan losses.  Included in impaired loans at   December 31, 2015  , are loans with carrying balances of   $14.5 million   that were not written down by charge-offs or for which there are no specific reserves in our allowance for loan losses.  Loans not written down by charge-offs or specific reserves at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , are considered to have sufficient collateral values, less costs to sell, to support the carrying balances of the loans. 
    
  The following table summarizes the average recorded investment in originated and acquired impaired loans (excluding PCI loans) and interest recognized on impaired loans as of, and for, the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   (in thousands):

There were   no   loans modified as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) during the three or   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The following table summarizes loans that were modified as troubled debt restructurings during the three and   nine   months ended September 30, 2015: 

At   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , we had TDRs of   $25.4 million   and   $26.6 million  , respectively. 
    
  Management classifies all TDRs as impaired loans.  Impaired loans are individually assessed to determine that the loan s carrying value is not in excess of the estimated fair value of the collateral less cost to sell, if the loan is collateral dependent, or the present value of the expected future cash flows, if the loan is not collateral dependent.  Management performs a detailed evaluation of each impaired loan and generally obtains updated appraisals as part of the evaluation.  In addition, management adjusts estimated fair values down to appropriately consider recent market conditions, our willingness to accept a lower sales price to effect a quick sale, and costs to dispose of any supporting collateral.  Determining the estimated fair value of underlying collateral (and related costs to sell) can be difficult in illiquid real estate markets and is subject to significant assumptions and estimates.  Management employs an independent third-party expert in appraisal preparation and review to ascertain the reasonableness of updated appraisals.  Projecting the expected cash flows under troubled debt restructurings which are not collateral dependent is inherently subjective and requires, among other things, an evaluation of the borrower s current and projected financial condition. Actual results may be significantly different than our projections and our established allowance for loan losses on these loans, which could have a material effect on our financial results.

Note 8   Fair Value Measurements 
  The following tables present the assets reported on the consolidated balance sheet at their estimated fair value as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , by level within the fair value hierarchy as required by the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC).  Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  The fair value hierarchy is as follows: 

Level 1 Inputs   Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. 

Level 2 Inputs   Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.  These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (for example, interest rates, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates) or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlations or other means. 

Level 3 Inputs   Significant unobservable inputs that reflect the Company s own assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.

Available for Sale Securities:   The estimated fair values for mortgage-backed securities, corporate and other debt securities, and certain less liquid equity securities are obtained from an independent nationally recognized third-party pricing service.  The estimated fair values are derived primarily from cash flow models, which include assumptions for interest rates, credit losses, and prepayment speeds.  Broker/dealer quotes are utilized as well, when such quotes are available and deemed representative of the market.  The significant inputs utilized in the cash flow models are based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company (Observable Inputs), and are therefore classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  The estimated fair values of equity securities consisting of publicly traded mutual funds are classified as Level 1 and are derived from quoted market prices in active markets.  There were no transfers of securities between Level 1 and Level 2 during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .      
  Trading Securities:   Fair values are derived from quoted market prices in active markets.  The assets consist of publicly traded mutual funds. 
    
  Impaired Loans:     At     September 30, 2016  ,     and     December 31, 2015  , the Company had     impaired loans     held-for-investment (excluding PCI loans) with outstanding     principal balances of   $20.3 million   and   $17.0 million  , respectively, which     were recorded at their estimated fair value of   $16.0 million   and   $13.6 million  ,     respectively.  The Company recorded a net decrease in the specific reserve for impaired loans of   $24,000   for     the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2016  , utilizing Level 3 inputs.  For     purposes of estimating fair value of impaired loans, management utilizes independent appraisals, if the loan is collateral dependent, adjusted downward by management, as necessary, for changes in relevant valuation factors subsequent to the appraisal date, or the present value of expected future cash flows for non-collateral dependent loans and troubled debt restructurings. 
    
  Other Real Estate Owned (OREO):    At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   no   assets acquired through foreclosure, or deed in lieu of foreclosure, as compared to   $45,000   at   December 31, 2015  .  These assets are recorded at estimated fair value, less estimated selling costs when acquired, establishing a new cost basis.  Estimated fair value is generally based on independent appraisals.  These appraisals include adjustments to comparable assets based on the appraisers  market knowledge and experience, and are considered Level 3 inputs.  When an asset is acquired, the excess of the loan balance over fair value, less estimated selling costs, is charged to the allowance for loan losses.  If the estimated fair value of the asset declines, a write-down is recorded through non-interest expense.  The valuation of foreclosed assets is subjective in nature and may be adjusted in the future because of changes in economic conditions.  
    
  In addition, the Company may be required, from time to time, to measure the fair value of certain other financial assets on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  The adjustments to fair value usually result from the application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write downs of individual assets. 
    
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  The FASB ASC Topic for Financial Instruments     requires disclosure of the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including those financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis.  The methodologies for estimating the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis are discussed above.  The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of other financial assets and financial liabilities not already discussed above: 
    
           (a)  
    Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Certificates of Deposit 
     Cash and cash equivalents are short-term in nature with original maturities of six months or less; the carrying amount approximates fair value.  Certificates of deposit having original terms of six-months or less; the carrying value generally approximates fair value.  Certificates of deposit with an original maturity of six months or greater; the fair value is derived from discounted cash flows.

  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued) 

(b) 
    Securities (Held to Maturity) 
     The estimated fair values for substantially all of our securities are obtained from an independent nationally recognized pricing service.  The independent pricing service utilizes market prices of same or similar securities whenever such prices are available.  Prices involving distressed sellers are not utilized in determining fair value.  Where necessary, the independent third-party pricing service estimates fair value using models employing techniques such as discounted cash flow analyses.  The assumptions used in these models typically include assumptions for interest rates, credit losses, and prepayments, utilizing market observable data where available. 
    
           (c) 
    Federal Home Loan Bank of New York Stock 
     The fair value for Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (FHLB) stock is its carrying value, since this is the amount for which it could be redeemed and there is no active market for this stock. 
    
           (d) 
    Loans (Held-for-Investment) 
     Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics.  Loans are segregated by type such as originated and purchased, and further segregated by residential mortgage, construction, land, multifamily, commercial and consumer.  Each loan category is further segmented into amortizing and non-amortizing and fixed and adjustable rate interest terms and by performing and nonperforming categories.  The fair value of loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current prepayment assumptions and current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities.  This method of estimating fair value does not incorporate the exit price concept of fair value prescribed by the FASB ASC Topic for Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. 
    
           (e) 
    Loans (Held-for-Sale) 
     Held-for-sale loans are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or estimated fair value, less costs to sell, and therefore fair value is equal to carrying value. 
    
           (f) 
    Deposits 
     The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as non-interest bearing demand deposits, savings, NOW and money market accounts, is equal to the amount payable on demand.  The fair value of certificates of deposit is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows.  The discount rate is estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. 
    
           (g) 
    Commitments to Extend Credit and Standby Letters of Credit 
     The fair value of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties.  For fixed-rate loan commitments, fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates.  The fair value of off balance sheet commitments is insignificant and therefore not included in the following table. 
    
           (h) 
    Borrowed Funds 
     The fair value of borrowed funds is estimated by discounting future cash flows based on rates currently available for debt with similar terms and remaining maturity. 
    
           (i) 
    Advance Payments by Borrowers for Taxes and Insurance 
     Advance payments by borrowers for taxes and insurance have no stated maturity; the fair value is equal to the amount currently payable.

The estimated fair value of the Company s significant financial instruments at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , is presented in the following tables (in thousands): 

Limitations 
  Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument.  These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument.  Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected losses, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors.  These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision.  Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. 
  Fair value estimates are based on existing on-and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments.  In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates.

Note 9   Earnings Per Share 
    
  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.  For purposes of calculating basic earnings per share, weighted average common shares outstanding excludes unallocated employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) shares that have not been committed for release and unvested restricted stock. 
    
  Diluted earnings per share is computed using the same method as basic earnings per share, but reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options and unvested shares of restricted stock were exercised and converted into common stock.  These potentially dilutive shares are included in the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period using the treasury stock method.  When applying the treasury stock method, we add: (1) the assumed proceeds from option exercises; (2) the tax benefit, if any, that would have been credited to additional paid-in capital assuming exercise of non-qualified stock options and vesting of shares of restricted stock; and (3) the average unamortized compensation costs related to unvested shares of restricted stock and stock options.  We then divide this sum by our average stock price for the period to calculate assumed shares repurchased.  The excess of the number of shares issuable over the number of shares assumed to be repurchased is added to basic weighted average common shares to calculate diluted earnings per share. 
    
  The following is a summary of the Company s earnings per share calculations and reconciliation of basic to diluted earnings per share for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands, except per share data): 

Note 10   Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
    In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,   which   provides guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments within the statement of cash flows.  ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, and is required to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented beginning in the year of adoption.  Since the ASU only impacts classification on the statements of cash flows, adoption will not affect the Company's consolidated financial statements or its cash and cash equivalents. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,   which requires     credit losses on most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments to be measured using an expected credit loss model (referred to as the current expected credit loss (CECL) model).  Under this model, entities will estimate credit losses over the entire contractual term of the instrument from the date of initial recognition of that instrument.  Current US GAAP is based on an incurred loss model that delays recognition of credit losses until it is probable the loss has been incurred.  Accordingly, it is anticipated that credit losses will be recognized earlier under the CECL model than under the incurred loss model.   ASU 2016-13 is effective for public business entities that are SEC filers for fiscal years and for interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.  The Company is currently evaluating the potential effect of adoption of this pronouncement on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,   which includes provisions to simplify certain aspects related to the accounting for share-based awards and the related financial statement presentation.  The ASU includes a requirement that the tax effect related to the settlement of share-based awards be recorded in income tax benefit or expense in the statements of earnings.  This change is required to be adopted prospectively in the period of adoption.  In addition, the ASU modifies the classification of  
  
   40 

     Table of Contents  
  NORTHFIELD BANCORP, INC. 
  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued) 

certain share-based payment activities within the statements of cash flows and these changes are required to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented, or in certain cases prospectively, beginning in the period of adoption.  ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period.  The impact of ASU No. 2016-09 could be material to the Company's results of operations and cash flows in future periods depending upon, among other things, the level of earnings and stock price of the Company. 
       
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842),   which is intended to increase transparency and comparability of accounting for lease transactions. The ASU will require all leases to be recognized on the balance sheet as lease assets and lease liabilities and will require both quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding key information about leasing arrangements.  Lessor accounting is largely unchanged.  ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period.  The Company is currently evaluating the potential effect of adoption of this pronouncement on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  , which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.  The guidance primarily affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments.  In addition, the FASB clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities.  The accounting for other financial instruments, such as loans, investments in debt securities, and financial liabilities is largely unchanged.  ASU No. 2016-01 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.  The adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,   Business Combinations (Topic 805) - Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments,   which requires that adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period of a business combination be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.  Furthermore, the income statement effects of such adjustments, if any, must be calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.  Under previous guidance, adjustments to provisional amounts identified during the measurement period were to be recognized retrospectively.  ASU 2015-16 was effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period.  The adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),   which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605,   Revenue Recognition  , and most industry-specific guidance throughout the industry topics of the codification.  This update will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company is still assessing the impact of the adoption of this pronouncement on its consolidated financial statements, but does not expect the adoption of the guidance to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  Note 1 to the Company s Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015   included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, as supplemented by this report, contains a summary of significant accounting policies.  Various elements of these accounting policies, by their nature, are inherently subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments.  Certain assets are carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at estimated fair value or the lower of cost or estimated fair value.  Policies with respect to the methodologies used to determine the allowance for loan losses, estimated cash flows of our PCI loans, and judgments regarding the valuation of intangible assets and securities as well as the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets are the most critical accounting policies because they are important to the presentation of the Company s financial condition and results of operations, involve a higher degree of complexity, and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters. The use of different judgments, assumptions, and estimates could result in material differences in the results of operations or financial condition.  These critical accounting policies and their application are reviewed periodically and, at least annually, with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.  For a further discussion of the critical accounting policies of the Company, see  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

Total consideration paid for Hopewell Valley was $55.4 million, consisting of $13.7 million in cash and 2,707,381 shares of common stock valued at $41.7 million based upon the $15.41 per share closing price of Northfield Bancorp, Inc.'s common stock on January 8, 2016.  
    
  Net income was   $17.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $14.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  Basic and diluted earnings per common share were   $0.40   and   $0.39  , respectively, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to basic and diluted earnings per common share of   $0.33   and   $0.32  , respectively, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  Earnings for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , reflect merger-related expenses of approximately $2.4 million, net of tax, or $0.05 per basic and diluted share, related to the acquisition of Hopewell Valley.  Earnings for the   nine months ended   September 30, 2015 included a charge of $795,000, or, $0.02 per share, related to the write-down of deferred tax assets as a result of New York City tax reforms enacted in April 2015 and merger expenses of $437,000, or $0.01 per share, related to Hopewell Valley.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , our return on average assets was   0.65%  , as compared to   0.60%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , our return on average stockholders  equity was   3.92%   as compared to   3.24%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  

Comparison of Financial Condition at     September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015    
  Total assets   increase  d   $582.0 million  , or   18.2%  , to   $3.78 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $3.20 billion   at   December 31, 2015  , primarily due to an increase in loans held-for-investment, net, of   $542.5 million   and an increase in goodwill of   $22.3 million   associated with the acquisition of Hopewell Valley. 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents   decrease  d   $15.7 million  , or   30.3%  , to   $36.1 million   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $51.9 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  Balances fluctuate based on the timing of receipt of security and loan repayments and the redeployment of cash into other asset classes, or the funding of deposit or borrowing obligations.  
      
  The available-for-sale securities portfolio totaled   $548.4 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $541.6 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  At   September 30, 2016  ,   $497.7 million   of the portfolio consisted of residential mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae.  In addition, the Company held   $46.1 million   in corporate bonds, all of which were considered investment grade at   September 30, 2016  , and other securities of $4.6 million (including   $1.1 million   of equity investments in money market mutual funds).

Loans held-for-investment, net,   increase  d   $542.5 million  , or   22.9%  , to   $2.92 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $2.37 billion   at   December 31, 2015  , primarily due to the addition of $342.6 million of loans acquired from Hopewell Valley, two loan pool purchases totaling $158.1 million, which consisted primarily of multifamily loans, and to a lesser extent, loan originations. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our commercial real estate concentration (as defined by regulatory guidance) to total risk-based capital was approximately 370%.  Management believes that the Bank has implemented appropriate risk management practices including risk assessments, board approved underwriting policies and related procedures, monitoring bank portfolio performance, market analysis (economic and real estate) and stress testing of the Bank s commercial real estate portfolio under severe adverse economic conditions.  Although management believes the Bank has implemented appropriate policies and procedures to manage our commercial real estate concentration risk, the Bank s regulators could require us to implement additional policies and procedures or could require us to maintain higher levels of regulatory capital, which might adversely affect our loan originations, ability to pay dividends, and profitability. 
    
  Originated loans held-for-investment, net, totaled   $2.07 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $1.93 billion   at   December 31, 2015  .  The   increase   was primarily due to an increase in multifamily real estate loans of   $120.2 million  , or   9.1%  , to   $1.44 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $1.32 billion   at   December 31, 2015  .  The following table details our multifamily real estate originations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015 (dollars in thousands): 

Acquired loans increased by   $404.6 million   to   $813.6 million   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $409.0 million   at December 31, 2015, due to $342.6 million of loans acquired from Hopewell Valley, and two loan pool purchases totaling approximately $158.1 million, which consisted primarily of multifamily loans located in New York and Eastern Pennsylvania.  The following table provides the details of the loans purchased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (dollars in thousands): 

Purchased credit-impaired ( PCI ) loans totaled   $32.8 million   at   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $33.1 million   at   December 31, 2015  , and include $4.9 million of PCI loans acquired as part of the Hopewell Valley acquisition.  The remaining $27.9 million of PCI loans were primarily acquired as part of a transaction with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  The Company accreted interest income of   $4.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $3.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   related to the PCI loans.

Total liabilities   increase  d   $521.3 million  , or   19.7%  , to   $3.16 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $2.64 billion   at   December 31, 2015  .  The   increase   was primarily attributable to an   increase   in deposits of   $576.1 million  , partially offset by   decrease  s in borrowed funds of   $63.7 million  , due to a shift in our balance sheet funding strategy.  The increase in deposits was primarily due to $456.2 million of deposits acquired from Hopewell Valley. 
       
  Deposits   increase  d   $576.1 million  , or   28.1%  , to   $2.63 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $2.05 billion   at   December 31, 2015  .  The   increase   was attributable to   increase  s of   $54.2 million   in certificates of deposit accounts, $43.4 million in savings accounts, $203.7 million in money market accounts, and   $274.8 million   in transaction accounts.     
    
  Borrowings and securities sold under agreements to repurchase   decrease  d by   $63.7 million  , or   11.4%  , to   $494.4 million   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $558.1 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  Management utilizes borrowings to mitigate interest rate risk, for short-term liquidity,     and to a lesser extent as part of leverage strategies.  The following is a table of term borrowing maturities (excluding capitalized leases and overnight borrowings) and the weighted average rate by year at   September 30, 2016   (dollars in thousands):    

Total stockholders  equity   increase  d by   $60.7 million   to   $620.5 million   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $559.8 million   at   December 31, 2015  , primarily due to common stock issued for the purchase of Hopewell Valley, net income earned for the period, and an increase in unrealized gains on our securities-available-for sale portfolio, partially offset by dividends paid to stockholders.  The Company issued 2,707,381 shares of common stock in the Hopewell Valley acquisition at a price of $15.41, which resulted in a $41.7 million increase in stockholders' equity. 
    
  Comparison of Operating Results for the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   and   2015    
    
  Net income.     Net income was   $17.9 million   and   $14.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  Net income for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , included merger-related expenses of $3.9 million ($2.4 million after tax) associated with the acquisition of Hopewell Valley, which was completed on January 8, 2016.  Net income for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , included a tax charge of $795,000 related to the write-down of deferred tax assets as a result of New York City tax reforms enacted in April 2015, and merger expenses of $437,000 related to Hopewell Valley.  Other significant variances from the comparable prior year period are as follows: a   $15.8 million     increase   in net interest income, a   $117,000     decrease   in the provision for loan losses, a   $1.7 million     increase   in non-interest income, a   $12.7 million     increase   in non-interest expense, and a $  881,000     increase   in income tax expense. 
    
  Interest Income  .     Interest income   increase  d   $17.5 million  , or   23.2%  , to   $92.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   $75.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , due to an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets of   $555.0 million  , or   19.3%  , and an   11   basis point increase in yields earned on interest-earning assets.  Interest income on loans increased by   $18.8 million  , primarily attributable to an increase in the average loan balances of   $652.8 million  , which was partially offset by a   seven   basis point decrease in the yield.  The increase in average loans was largely due to $342.6 million of loans added through the Hopewell Valley acquisition, $158.1 million in loan pool purchases of primarily multifamily loans, and to a lesser extent, originated loan growth.  The Company accreted interest income related to its PCI loans of   $4.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $3.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  Interest income on loans for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , reflected loan prepayment income of $1.4 million compared to $1.7 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Interest Expense  .     Interest expense   increase  d   $1.7 million  , or   11.9%  , to   $16.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   $14.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  The   increase   was due to an increase of   $3.3 million   in interest expense on deposits, partially offset by a decrease of   $1.6 million   in interest expense on borrowings.  The increase in interest expense on deposits was attributed to an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits of   $590.1 million  , or   37.3%  , to   $2.17 billion   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   $1.58 billion   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , and a four basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits to   0.66%   from   0.62%  .   
  
   45 

     Table of Contents  

The decrease in interest expense on borrowings was attributed to a decrease in the average balances of borrowings of   $141.9 million  , or   22.5%  , to   $489.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   $631.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , partially offset by a   one   basis point increase in the cost of borrowings to   1.52%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
  Net Interest Income  .     Net interest income for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016     increase  d   $15.8 million  , or   25.9%  , primarily due to a   $555.0 million  , or   19.3%  , increase in our average interest-earning assets and a 16 basis point increase in our net interest margin to   2.99%  .  The increase in average interest-earning assets was primarily attributable to an increase in the average balance of loans outstanding of   $652.8 million  , partially offset by a decrease in average mortgage-backed securities of   $107.0 million  .  Yields earned on interest-earning assets increased   eleven   basis points to   3.62%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   3.51%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased seven basis points to   0.81%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to   0.88%   for the comparable prior year period. 
     
  Provision for Loan Losses  .     The provision for loan losses   decrease  d by   $117,000   to $  355,000   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   $472,000   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to an improvement in asset quality, including declines in non-performing and delinquent loans.  Acquired loans, including those acquired from Hopewell Valley, are valued at estimated fair value on the date of acquisition, with no initial related allowance for loan losses.  Net charge-offs were   $785,000   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to net charge-offs of $1.1 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  Net charge-offs in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , were primarily related to five previously impaired loans to one borrower that were restructured during the first quarter of 2015 and subsequently sold in the fourth quarter of 2015.  These loans had existing specific reserves associated with them that adequately covered the charge-offs, resulting in no material effect on the provision for loan losses for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Non-interest Income  .    Non-interest income   increase  d   $1.7 million  , or   28.6%  , to   $7.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   $5.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to increases in fees and service charges for customers of   $679,000  , income on bank owned life insurance of   $172,000  , and gains on securities transactions, net, of   $946,000  .  These increases were partially offset by a decrease in other income of   $144,000  , primarily related to a realized gain on the sale of an other real estate owned property (OREO) during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  Securities gains, net, in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , included gains of $389,000 related to the Company s trading portfolio, while the comparative 2015 period included losses of $390,000 related to the Company s trading portfolio.  The trading portfolio is utilized to fund the Company s deferred compensation obligation to certain employees and directors of the Company's deferred compensation plan (the Plan).  The participants of this Plan, at their election, defer a portion of their compensation. Gains and losses on trading securities have no effect on net income since participants benefit from, and bear the full risk of, changes in the trading securities market values. Therefore, the Company records an equal and offsetting amount in compensation expense, reflecting the change in the Company s obligations under the Plan. 
      
  Non-interest Expense  .     Non-interest expense   increase  d   $12.7 million  , or   29.1%  , to   $56.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   $43.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to: (1) an   $8.4 million     increase   in compensation and employee benefits largely driven by increased salary and benefit expenses attributable to the addition of Hopewell Valley employees and general merit-related salary increases effective January 1, 2016, charges of $2.3 million related to severance, retention, and change-in-control compensation associated with the Hopewell Valley acquisition, and an increase in stock compensation expense related to the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2014 EIP"); (2) a   $992,000   increase in occupancy expense due to the addition of nine Hopewell Valley branches; (3) a   $2.1 million   increase in data processing costs, of which approximately $1.1 million was due to conversion costs associated with the Hopewell Valley acquisition; (4) an increase in professional fees of   $375,000  , primarily related to the Hopewell Valley acquisition; and (5) an   $835,000   increase in other expense, largely due to an increase in Directors  equity awards associated with the 2014 EIP, and increases in core deposit premium amortization and general office expenses related to the Hopewell Valley acquisition. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in OREO expenses. 
    
  Income Tax Expense  .     The Company recorded income tax expense of   $9.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $8.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  The effective tax rate for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   34.4%   compared to   37.9%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  Income tax expense for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   included a deferred tax asset write-down of $795,000 related to New York City tax reforms enacted in April 2015 and $437,000 in non-deductible merger-related expenses.

  Net income.     Net income was   $7.3 million   and   $4.7 million   for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  Significant variances from the comparable prior year period are as follows: a $  5.7 million     increase   in net interest income, a   $1.0 million     increase   in non-interest income, a   $2.5 million     increase   in non-interest expense, and a $  1.3 million     increase   in income tax expense. 
    
  Interest Income  .     Interest income increased   $6.0 million  , or   23.3%  , to   $31.5 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $25.6 million   for the quarter   September 30, 2015  , due to an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets of   $577.7 million  , or   19.7%  , and an   11   basis point increase in yields earned on interest-earning assets.  Interest income on loans increased by   $6.1 million  , primarily attributable to an increase in the average loan balances of   $635.0 million  , which was partially offset by a four basis point decrease in the yield. The increase in average loans was largely due to $342.6 million of loans added through the Hopewell Valley acquisition, $158.1 million in loan pool purchases of primarily multifamily loans, and to a lesser extent, originated loan growth.  The Company accreted interest income related to its PCI loans of   $1.3 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $1.0 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  Interest income on loans for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , reflected loan prepayment income of $459,000 compared to $489,000 for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .

Interest expense increased   $277,000  , or   5.5%  , to   $5.3 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $5.0 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase was due to an increase of   $704,000   in interest expense on deposits, partially offset by a decrease of   $427,000   in interest expense on borrowings.  The increase in interest expense on deposits was attributed to an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits of   $524.9 million  , or   30.6%  , to   $2.24 billion   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $1.71 billion   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  , partially offset by a three basis point decrease in the cost of interest-bearing deposits to   0.63%   from 0.66%.  The decrease in interest expense on borrowings was attributed to a decrease in the average balances of borrowings of   $98.4 million  , or   17.4%  , to   $466.5 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $564.9 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  , and a four basis point decrease in the cost of borrowings to   1.47%  , from 1.51% for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  Net Interest Income  .     Net interest income for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  ,   increase  d   $5.7 million  , or   27.6%  , primarily due to a   $577.7 million  , or   19.7%  , increase in average interest-earning assets and a   19   basis point increase in our net interest margin to   2.98%  .  The increase in average interest-earning assets was primarily attributable to an increase in average loans outstanding of   $635.0 million   and an increase in average other securities of   $22.3 million  , partially offset by a decrease in average mortgage-backed securities of   $86.8 million  .  Yields earned on interest-earning assets increased   11   basis points to   3.58%   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , from   3.47%   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased nine basis points to   0.78%   for the current quarter as compared to 0.87% for the comparable prior year quarter. 
     
  Provision for Loan Losses  .     The provision for loan losses   increase  d by   $272,000   to $  472,000   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $200,000   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to loan growth and higher net charge-offs during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  .  Net charge-offs were   $449,000   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to net charge-offs of $61,000 for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  Acquired loans, including those acquired from Hopewell Valley, were valued at estimated fair value on the date of acquisition, with no initial related allowance for loan losses.  
    
  Non-interest Income  .    Non-interest income   increase  d   $1.0 million  , or   60.1%  , to   $2.7 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $1.7 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to increases in fees and service charges for customers of   $208,000  , and gains on securities transactions, net, of   $750,000  .  Securities gains, net, in the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , included gains of $344,000 related to the Company s trading portfolio described above, while the comparative 2015 quarter included losses of $401,000 related to the Company s trading portfolio. 
      
  Non-interest Expense  .     Non-interest expense   increase  d   $2.5 million  , or   17.0%  , to   $17.4 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $14.8 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  , due primarily to: (1) a   $2.3 million     increase   in compensation and employee benefits due to the addition of Hopewell Valley employees and general merit-related salary increases effective January 1, 2016; (2) a   $304,000   increase in occupancy costs associated with the addition of nine Hopewell Valley branches; (3) a   $793,000   increase in data processing costs of which $477,000 relate to contract termination and other conversion costs associated with the Hopewell Valley acquisition; and (4) a   $488,000   decrease in other expenses, primarily due to lower Directors  equity awards expense.

Accruing Loans 30 to 89 Days Delinquent 
    
  Loans 30 to 89 days delinquent and on accrual status totaled   $12.5 million   and   $21.6 million   at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The following table sets forth delinquencies for accruing loans by type and by amount at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands):      

The decrease in the delinquent loans was primarily attributable to one commercial real estate loan with a balance of $5.6 million at December 31, 2015, which was 31 days delinquent, and became current during the first quarter of 2016.  This loan had a balance of $5.5 million at   September 30, 2016  , was classified as impaired, and adequately covered by collateral with a recent appraised value of $9.3 million.   
    
  Loans Subject to TDR Agreements 
    
  Included in non-accruing loans are loans subject to TDR agreements totaling   $2.7 million   and $4.4 million at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  At   September 30, 2016  , $2.2 million, or 84.1%, of the   $2.7 million   were not performing in accordance with their restructured terms, as compared to $2.3 million, or 53.2%, of the $4.4 million at December 31, 2015.  Four separate relationships account for the loans not performing in accordance with their restructured terms at   September 30, 2016  , of which three of the loans are primarily collateralized by real estate with an aggregate appraised value of $2.9 million.   
    
  The Company also holds loans subject to restructuring agreements that are on accrual status totaling   $22.7 million   and   $22.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  At   September 30, 2016  , all these loans were performing in accordance with the restructured terms as compared to loans totaling $7.2 million, or 32.3%, of the   $22.3 million   at   December 31, 2015  , that were not performing in accordance with their restructured terms.  The majority of the $7.2 million at December 31, 2015, was attributable to one commercial real estate loan with a balance of $5.6 million which was 31 days delinquent and became current in the first quarter of 2016.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Liquidity  .  The overall objective of our liquidity management is to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to meet financial commitments and to take advantage of lending and investment opportunities.  Northfield Bank manages liquidity in order to meet deposit withdrawals on demand or at contractual maturity, to repay borrowings as they mature, and to fund new loans and investments as opportunities arise. 
  Northfield Bank's primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, borrowed funds, the proceeds from maturing securities and short-term investments, and to a lesser extent the proceeds from the sales of loans and securities and wholesale borrowings.  The scheduled amortization of loans and securities, as well as proceeds from borrowed funds, are predictable sources of funds.  Other funding sources, however, such as deposit inflows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and competition.  Northfield Bank is a member of the FHLB, which provides an additional source of short-term and long-term funding.  Northfield Bank also has short-term borrowing capabilities with the Federal Reserve Bank.  Northfield Bank s borrowed funds, excluding capitalized lease obligations and floating rate advances, were   $484.1 million   at   September 30, 2016  , and had a weighted average interest rate of   1.48%  .  A total of   $165.9 million   of these borrowings will mature in less than one year.  Borrowed funds, excluding capitalized lease obligations and floating rate advances, were $551.1 million at   December 31, 2015  .  Northfield Bank has the ability to obtain additional funding from the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank discount window of approximately   $787.7 million   utilizing unencumbered securities of   $166.4 million   and loans of   $700.0 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  Northfield Bank expects to have sufficient funds available to meet current commitments in the normal course of business. 
  Northfield Bancorp, Inc. (standalone) is a separate legal entity from Northfield Bank and must provide for its own liquidity to pay dividends, repurchase its stock, and for other corporate purposes. Northfield Bancorp, Inc.'s primary source of liquidity is dividend payments from Northfield Bank.  At   September 30, 2016  , Northfield Bancorp, Inc. (stand alone) had liquid assets of approximately $12.8 million. 
  Capital Resources  .  At   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , as set forth in the following table, Northfield Bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements to which it was subject at such dates.       

    On January 1, 2015, a final rule issued by the federal bank regulatory agencies became effective which revised the leverage and risk-based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.  Among other things, the new rule establishes a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement (4.5% of risk-weighted assets), increases the minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets requirement (from 4% to 6% of risk-weighted assets) and assigns a higher risk weight (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on non-accrual status, and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development, or construction of real property.  The final rule also requires unrealized gains and losses on certain  available-for-sale  securities holdings to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirements unless a one-time opt-in or opt-out election is exercised.  The rule limits a banking organization's capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a  capital conservation buffer  consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.  The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in incrementally, starting at 0.625% on January 1, 2016, and increasing to 1.25% on January 1, 2017, 1.875% on January 1, 2018, and 2.5% on January 1, 2019, when the full capital conservation buffer requirement will be effective.  The

     Table of Contents  

final rule also implemented consolidated capital requirements for savings and loan holding companies, such as the Company, effective January 1, 2015.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , as set forth in the following table, Northfield Bancorp, Inc. exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements to which it was subject at such dates.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 
  In the normal course of operations, the Company engages in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, are not recorded in the financial statements.  These transactions primarily relate to lending commitments.  These arrangements are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial condition. 
  The following table shows the contractual obligations of the Company by expected payment period as of   September 30, 2016  : 

Commitments to fund unused lines of credit are agreements to lend additional funds to customers as long as there have been no violations of any of the conditions established in the agreements (original or restructured).  Commitments to originate loans generally have a fixed expiration or other termination clauses, which may or may not require payment of a fee.  Since some of these loan commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, total commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    Management of Market Risk 
  General  .  A majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature.  Consequently, our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk.  Our assets, consisting primarily of mortgage-related assets and loans, generally have longer maturities than our liabilities, which consist primarily of deposits and wholesale borrowings.  As a result, a principal part of our business strategy involves managing interest rate risk and limiting the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates.  Accordingly, our board of directors has established a management risk committee, comprised of our Chief Investment Officer, who chairs this Committee, our Chief Executive Officer, our President/Chief Operating Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, our Chief Lending Officer, our Executive Vice President of Operations and our Executive Vice President of  Branch Administration and Business Development.  This committee is responsible for, among other things, evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for recommending to the risk management committee of our board of directors the level of risk that is appropriate given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors. 
    
  We seek to manage our interest rate risk in order to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates.  As part of our ongoing asset-liability management, we currently use the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk:  

originating multifamily loans and commercial real estate loans that generally tend to have shorter maturities than one-to-four family residential real estate loans and have higher interest rates that generally reset from five to ten years; 
                
    investing in shorter term investment grade corporate securities and mortgage-backed securities; and 
                
    obtaining general financing through lower-cost core deposits and longer-term FHLB advances and repurchase agreements. 
       
  Shortening the average term of our interest-earning assets by increasing our investments in shorter-term assets, as well as originating loans with variable interest rates, helps to match the maturities and interest rates of our assets and liabilities better, thereby reducing the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. 
    
  Net Portfolio Value Analysis  .    We compute amounts by which the net present value of our assets and liabilities (net portfolio value or NPV) would change in the event market interest rates changed over an assumed range of rates.  Our simulation model uses a discounted cash flow analysis to measure the interest rate sensitivity of NPV.  Depending on current market interest rates, we estimate the economic value of these assets and liabilities under the assumption that interest rates experience an instantaneous and sustained increase of 100, 200, 300, or 400 basis points, or a decrease of 100 and 200 basis points, which is based on the current interest rate environment.  A basis point equals one-hundredth of one percent, and 100 basis points equals one percent.  An increase in interest rates from 3% to 4% would mean, for example, a 100 basis point increase in the  Change in Interest Rates  column below.  
    
  Net Interest Income Analysis.    In addition to NPV calculations, we analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through our net interest income model.  Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.  In our model, we estimate what our net interest income would be for a twelve-month period.  Depending on current market interest rates we then calculate what the net interest income would be for the same period under the assumption that interest rates experience an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease of 100, 200, 300, or 400 basis points, or a decrease of 100 and 200 basis points, which is based on the current interest rate environment. 
    
  The following tables set forth, as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , our calculation of the estimated changes in our NPV, NPV ratio, and percent change in net interest income that would result from the designated instantaneous and sustained changes in interest rates (dollars in thousands).  Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments and deposit repricing characteristics including decay rates, and correlations to movements in interest rates, and should not be relied on as indicative of actual results. 
  
   54 

     Table of Contents  

At   September 30, 2016  , in the event of a 200 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would experience a   33.66%   increase in estimated net portfolio value and a   2.23%   decrease in net interest income.  In the event of a 400 basis point increase in interest rates, we would experience a   24.65%   decrease in estimated net portfolio value and a   16.75%   decrease in net interest income.  Our policies provide that, in the event of a 200 basis point decrease or less in interest rates, our net present value ratio should decrease by no more than 400 basis points and in the event of a 400 basis point increase or less, our net present value ratio should decrease by no more than 750 basis points.  In the event of a 200 basis point decrease or less, our projected net interest income should decrease by no more than 15% in year one, and in the event of a 400 basis point increase or less, our projected net interest income should decrease by no more than 37% in year one.  Additionally, our policy states that our net portfolio value should be at least between 8% and 10% of total assets before and after such shock.  However, when the federal funds rate is low and negative rate shocks do not produce meaningful results, management may temporarily suspend use of guidelines for negative rate shocks.  At   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all board approved policies with respect to interest rate risk management.  
    
  Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in determining interest rate risk through changes in net portfolio value and net interest income.  Our model requires us to make certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates.  However, we also apply consistent parallel yield curve shifts (in both directions) to determine possible changes in net interest income if the theoretical yield curve shifts occurred gradually.  Net interest income analysis also adjusts the asset and liability repricing analysis based on changes in prepayment rates resulting from the parallel yield curve shifts.  In addition, the net portfolio value and net interest income information presented assume that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assume that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities.  Accordingly, although interest rate risk calculations provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net portfolio value or net interest income and will differ from actual results.
