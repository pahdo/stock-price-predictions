Audit committee standing members consisted of John Zotos and

Igor Gorodnitsky.   Mr. Gorodnitsky has been our
President and member of the Board of Directors since September 26, 2008, and he became the Company's Secretary and Principal Executive
Officer in November of 2012. Mr. Gorodnitsky developed expertise in handling and processing hazardous waste material. As a Senior
Haz-Mat Specialist, he coordinated and successfully completed more than 500 emergency response Haz-mat clean-ups over the past
20 years. He coordinated and supervised Haz Mat projects, emergency and routine spill clean-ups, and confined space entry tasks.
He coordinated and scheduled manpower and purchased and scheduled equipment and materials for containment and treatment of spills.
He successfully managed, coordinated and supervised projects including Hazscanning, sampling, lab-packing, manifesting, profiling,
labeling, and other special procedures for a variety of commercial clients and municipalities. He is a chemist by training and
holds numerous certifications and licenses including Hazwoper Training Program, Confined Space Entry and Gas Vapour HazCating,
Certified Uniform Waste Manifest Training, Basic and Intermediate HazCating, On-Scene Incident Commander Emergency, Site Remediation
Methods, Underground Storage Tank Removal, Health   Safety Supervisor Certification, Hazardous Certification, and Tosco Refinery
Safety. Mr. Gorodnitsky was president of Express Environmental Corp. since its inception in 1980 until he sold his interest in
January 2009. Based on his significant industry experience and management skills it was determined that Mr. Gorodnitsky should
serve on the Company s Board. 

James Fuller . Mr. Fuller is an independent director,
and has been Chairman of our Audit Committee and Independent Financial Expert since February, 2010. He was formerly a Vice President
of the New York Stock Exchange and director of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation. In addition to his over 30 years
of experience in the securities markets, Mr. Fuller sat on the Board of Trustees of the University of California, Santa Cruz and
previously served as Chairman of their Audit Committee and Independent Financial Expert. Jim has been a partner at Baytree Capital
Associates, LLC since March 2008. He received his BS in Political Science from San Jose State University and his MBA from California
State University - Fresno. Mr. Fuller also served as a Director of Propell Technologies Group, Inc (OTCQB: Propell), a public company
engaged in oil and gas exploration from October 14, 2011 until February 17, 2015. Based on Mr. Fuller s extensive experience
in finance as well as his prior public company experience it was determined that Mr. Fuller should serve on the Company s
Board. 

Roman Gordon.  Mr. Gordon has been our Chief Technology
Officer since 2011, and he served as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board since September 26, 2008 prior to that and
until 2011. He also became a permanent Director of the Company's Board during fiscal year 2015. With more than 15 years of experience
in energy risk management and business management, he is one of the inventors of our intellectual properties. From 2003 to 2005
Mr. Gordon was president of Bubble Bee Corp., a car wash development company. Mr. Gordon was in charge of engineering, construction
and development of environmentally friendly car wash water recycling systems. From 1997 to 2002, he was Chairman of a publicly
traded electric service provider company (ESP), PowerSource Corp., where he participated in the power marketing of renewable energy
and in evaluation and environmental compliance. PowerSource Energy Service Provider Corporation was an active participant in the
 PowerGreen - 100  and  PowerGreen - 25  programs. Mr. Gordon received his bachelor degree in 1974 from Polytechnical
Institute in Civil Engineering. Based on his knowledge of the Company s industry and technology, and his business understanding
and prior public company experience it was determined that Mr. Gordon should serve on the Company s Board. Mr. Gordon resigned
as the Company s CTO and a Board Member in July of 2016, and is employed as the Company s Senior Technology Manager. 

Naum Voloshin.  Mr. Voloshin has over 20 years of experience
in investment banking, business operations and marketing. Prior to joining CTi in November 2012, Mr. Voloshin worked for several
developmental stage companies in US, Europe and Asia. The scope of his duties was to provide management, supervision, business
experience and marketing skills. 

John Zotos . Mr. Zotos was appointed
as a director in June of 2014. He currently serves as a director of Propell Technologies Group, Inc (OTCQB: Propell), and its wholly
owned subsidiary Novas Energy (USA), Inc., companies engaged in oil and gas exploration. Since July 2007, he has served as a principal
and a managing partner of JC Holdings, LLC, a company engaged in the business of buying, selling and managing heavy equipment and
commercial real estate. Based on his significant business and public company experience, which gives him a broad and extensive
understanding of our operations and our industry, and his broad understanding of the operational, financial and strategic issues
facing public companies, it was determined that Mr. Zotos should serve on the Company s Board.  

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance  

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
requires our executive officers, directors, persons who own more than 10% of our common stock, and immediate family members living
in the same household to file an Initial Statement of Beneficial Ownership on Form 3 and changes in ownership on Form 4 with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Such  insiders  are required by SEC rules to furnish us with
copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 

Based on a review of Forms 3, 4, and 5 and amendments thereto
furnished to us during fiscal 2016 ended June 30, 2016, there were no delinquent forms filed during the year except one late filing
of a Form 4 for a disposition of shares by Roman Gordon.. 

Director Independence  

Although our common stock is not listed on a national securities
exchange, for purposes of independence we use the definition of independence applied by the NASDAQ stock market. The Board has
determined that Messrs. Zotos and Fuller are  independent  in accordance with such definition. Neither Mr. Gorodnitsky
nor Mr. Gordon is independent due to their current positions with the Company. 

Code of Ethics  

We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies
to all officers, directors and employees. A copy may also be obtained free of charge by mailing a request in writing to: Cavitation
Technologies, Inc., 10019 Canoga Ave., Chatsworth, CA 91311 USA. If we make any substantive amendments to the Code of Business
Conduct and Ethics or grant any waiver from a provision of the Code to any executive officer or director, we will promptly disclose
the nature of the amendment or waiver in a current report on Form 8-K.

ITEM 12.  SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL
OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS  

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT 

The following table sets forth certain information concerning
the number of shares of our common stock known by us to be owned beneficially as of December 9, 2016 and the date hereof by: (i)
each person (including any group) that owns more than 5% of any class of the voting securities of our company; (ii) each director
and officer of our company; and (iii) directors and officers as a group. Unless otherwise indicated, the stockholders listed possess
sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares shown. The address for all directors and officers, unless otherwise
indicated, is 10019 Canoga Avenue, Chatsworth, CA 91311. 

Stock Options   

The Company has not adopted a formal stock
option plan. However, it has assumed outstanding stock options resulting from the acquisition of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Hydrodynamic
Technology, Inc. In addition, the Company has made periodic non- plan grants. A summary of the stock option activity from June
30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: 

In June 2015, the Company cancelled fully
vested stock options to purchase 800,858 shares of common stock that were granted to a consultant in prior periods. In exchange
for the cancellation, the Company issued to the consultant 800,858 shares of common stock. 

As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, all outstanding
options were fully vested and exercisable. The intrinsic value of the outstanding options as of June 30, 2016 was $0. The following
table summarizes additional information concerning options outstanding and exercisable at June 30, 2016. 

Warrants   

A summary of the Company s warrant activity and related
information from as of June 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows. 

In July 2014, the Company issued warrants
to purchase 5,193,329 shares of common stock to the purchasers of our common stock offering. The warrants are exercisable at $0.12
per share, vesting immediately and expiring in 5 years from the grant date. 

During the year ended June 30, 2015, the
Company recognized compensation expense of $245,375 to account for the fair value of vested warrants granted to a consultant and
a member of our Board of Directors. 

As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, all outstanding
warrants were fully vested and exercisable. The intrinsic value of the outstanding warrants as of June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0
and $651,999, respectively. The following table summarizes additional information concerning warrants outstanding and exercisable
at June 30, 2016. 

The table below represents the assumptions
used in valuing the stock options and warrants granted in fiscal 2016 and 2015: 

The assumptions used in the Black Scholes
models referred to above are based upon the following data: (1) the contractual life of the underlying non-employee options
is the expected life. The expected life of the employee option is estimated by considering the contractual term of the option,
the vesting period of the option, the employees  expected exercise behavior and the post-vesting employee turnover rate.
(2) The expected stock price volatility was based upon the Company s historical stock price over the expected term of
the option. (3) The risk free interest rate is based on published U.S. Treasury Department interest rates for the expected terms
of the underlying options. (4) The expected dividend yield was based on the fact that the Company has not paid dividends to common
shareholders in the past and does not expect to pay dividends to common shareholders in the future. (5) The expected forfeiture
rate is based on historical forfeiture activity and assumptions regarding future forfeitures based on the composition of current
grantees. 

ITEM 13.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS,
AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE.  

Certain Related Party Transactions  

Other than compensation agreements and other arrangements with
our executive officers and directors, since the beginning of our last fiscal year , there has not been, and there is not currently
proposed, any transaction or series of similar transactions to which we were or will be a party in which the amount involved exceeded
or will exceed the lesser of $120,000 or one percent of the average of our total assets at year-end for the last two completed
fiscal years and in which any of our directors, executive officers, holders of more than five percent of any class of our voting
securities or any member of the immediate family of the foregoing persons had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. 

Director Independence  

As our common stock is currently traded on the OTC Bulletin
Board, we are not subject to the rules of any national securities exchange which require that a majority of a listed company's
directors and specified committees of the board of directors meet independence standards prescribed by such rules. For the purpose
of preparing the disclosures in this Report on Form 10-K regarding director independence, we have used the definition of  independent
director  set forth in the Marketplace Rules of The NASDAQ, which defines an  independent director  generally as
a person other than an executive officer or employee of the Company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the
opinion of the Company's board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities
of a director. Consistent with these standards, we believe that James Fuller and John Zotos are Independent Financial Experts and
independent directors. 

ITEM 14.  PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES  

Audit  

Our principal auditing firm during fiscal 2016 and 2015 was
Weinberg   Co, in Los Angeles. Weinberg   Co performed reviews of quarterly financial statements included on Forms 10-Q
for the first three quarters of 2016 and is the principal auditing firm for the audit of our annual financial statements included
with Form 10-K for fiscal 2016 and received approximately $91,000 for these services. 

Tax Fees  

The aggregate fees billed in fiscal 2016 and 2015 for professional
services rendered by the principal accountant for tax preparation amounted to $8,440 and $12,500 respectively. 

Audit Committee  

The charter of the Audit Committee provides that the Audit Committee
pre-approves all audit services and permitted non-audit services to be performed for CTi by its independent public accounting firm,
subject to the de minimus exceptions for non-audit services described in Section 10A(i)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act.
