      Table of Contents                   GOLDEN MATRIX GROUP, INC.         NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS        (Unaudited)           NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES      Golden Matrix Group, Inc. ( GMGI  or  Company ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 4, 2008, under the name Ibex Resources Corp. The Company business at the time was mining and exploration of mineral properties. On August 31, 2009, the Company changed its name to Source Gold Corp. in order to reflect the focus of the Company. In April 2016, the Company changed its name to Golden Matrix Group, Inc., reflected the changing direction of the Company business to software technology.      The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Golden Matrix Group, Inc. ( GMGI  or the  Company ) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s annual report for the year ended July 31, 2016 on Form 10-K filed on November 15, 2016.     In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the consolidated financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited consolidated financial statements for the most recent fiscal year ended July 31, 2016 have been omitted.         Use of Estimates      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the balance sheet. Actual results could differ from those estimates.      Cash and Cash Equivalents      For the purpose of the statements of cash flows, all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of these investments approximates fair value.      Revenues      Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is probable.      Foreign Currency Translation      The Company s functional currency is the US dollar as a substantial part of the Company s operations is based in Arizona. IRC s and NBI s functional currency is the Canadian dollar. The functional currency of SB and Vulture is the US dollar as its activities are in the USA. The Company uses the United States dollar as its reporting currency for consistency with registrants of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).     Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into US dollar reporting currency at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date and capital accounts are translated at historical rates. Income statement accounts are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the period. Transactions undertaken in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are translated using the exchange rate in effect as of the transaction date. Any exchange gains and losses are included in other comprehensive loss.                  7       
      Table of Contents           Diluted and Basic Loss per Share      Basic loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share are computed similar to basic income per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of common stock equivalents. Common stock equivalents represent the dilutive effect of the assumed exercise of any outstanding stock equivalents, using the treasury stock method, at either the beginning of the respective period presented or the date of issuance, whichever is later, and only if the common stock equivalents are considered dilutive based upon the Company s net income (loss) position at the calculation date.     There are no common stock equivalents outstanding and, thus, diluted and basic loss per share is the same.      Income Taxes      The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and loss carry-forwards and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rules on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in operations in the year of change. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is  more likely-than-not  that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.      Comprehensive Loss      The Company is required to report comprehensive loss, which includes net loss as well as changes in equity from non-owner sources.      Fair Value of Financial Instruments      Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of October 31, 2016 and July 31, 2016. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values. These financial instruments include cash and accounts payable. Fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values for cash and payables because they are short term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair values or they are payable on demand.      Stock-Based Compensation      The Company records stock based compensation in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 718 which requires the Company to recognize expense related to the fair value of its employee stock option awards. This eliminates accounting for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. The Company recognizes the cost of all share-based awards on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period of the award.     Stock based compensation for non-employees is accounted for using the Stock Based Compensation Topic of the FASB ASC 505. We use the fair value method for equity instruments granted to non-employees and will use the Black-Scholes model for measuring the fair value of options, if issued. The stock based fair value compensation is determined as of the date of the grant or the date at which the performance of the services is completed (measurement date) and is recognized over the vesting periods.      Subsequent Events      The Company evaluated subsequent events through the date these financial statements were issued for disclosure purposes.      Reclassification      Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation.                  8       
      Table of Contents           Recent Issued Accounting Pronouncements      In May 2014, a pronouncement was issued that creates common revenue recognition guidance for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The new guidance supersedes most preexisting revenue recognition guidance. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, with an option to adopt the standard one year earlier. The new standard is to be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on its financial statements.     In February 2016, a pronouncement was issued that creates new accounting and reporting guidelines for leasing arrangements.The new guidance requires organizations that lease assets to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet related to therights and obligations created by those leases, regardless of whether they are classified as finance or operating leases. Consistent with current guidance, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease primarilywill depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. The guidance also requires new disclosures to help financialstatement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The new standard iseffective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period,with early application permitted. The new standard is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. The Company iscurrently evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on its financial statements.     GMGI s management does not believe that any recently issued effective pronouncements, or pronouncements issued but not yet effective, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.      NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN      The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of GMGI have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company sustained a loss from operationof $57,672 for the three months ended October 31, 2016.  The Company had a working capital deficit and stockholders  deficit of $2,536,321 and $2,536,321 respectively, at October 31, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Without realization of additional capital, it would be unlikely for GMGI to continue as a going concern. GMGI's management plans on raising cash from public or private debt or equity financing, on an as needed basis, and in the longer term, revenues from the gambling business. GMGI's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on these additional cash financings, and, ultimately, upon achieving profitable operations through the development of its gambling business.      NOTE 3 - CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLES      Convertible notes payable at October 31, 2016 and July 31, 2016 consisted of the following:                        9       
      Table of Contents           Promissory Note #2      On March 19, 2012, the Company received $30,000 cash from the issuance of a convertible promissory note in the amount of $30,000. The promissory note is unsecured, interest free and repayable upon demand.     The note may be converted at the option of the holder into Common stock of the Company. The fixed conversion price is $0.01 per share. Accordingly the note may be converted into 3,000,000 common shares of the Company.     The Company determined that this Promissory note should be accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC 470-20 which addresses  Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features". The beneficial conversion feature is calculated at its intrinsic value (that is, the difference between the conversion price $0.01 and the fair value of the common stock into which the debt is convertible at the commitment date (per share being $0.08), multiplied by the number of shares into which the debt is convertible. The valuation of the beneficial conversion feature recorded cannot be greater than the face value of the note issued.

During the three month ended October 31, 2016, cash provided (used) in operating activities was $1,356 compared to $(246,000) for the three month ended October 31, 2015. The change in the amounts of cash used for operating activities was primarily due to the noncash expenses relating to the interest on convertible notes.     During the three months ended October 31, 2016 cash used in investing activities was $0 compared to $0 for the three month ended October 31, 2015.      During the three month ended October 31, 2016, cash provided by financing activitieswas $0 compared to $246,000for the three month ended October 31, 2015.       Material Events and Uncertainties      Our operating results are difficult to forecast. Our prospects should be evaluated in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties commonly encountered by comparable development stage companies.     There can be no assurance that we will successfully address such risks, expenses and difficulties.              ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.       ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES        Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures      Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by our company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"). Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of April 30, 2015, due to the material weaknesses resulting from the Board of Directors not currently having any independent members and no director qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K, and controls were not designed and in place to ensure that all disclosures required were originally addressed in our financial statements. Please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on November 12, 2014 for a complete discussion relating to the foregoing evaluation of Disclosures and Procedures.      Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting      Our management has also evaluated our internal control over financial reporting, and there have been no significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect those controls subsequent to the date of our last evaluation.     The Company is not required by current SEC rules to include, and does not include, an auditor's attestation report. The Company's registered public accounting firm has not attested to Management's reports on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.              PART II - OTHER INFORMATION         ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS       The Company has no known legal disputes at this time.       ITEM 1A.
