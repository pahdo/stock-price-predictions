 ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION    

 Organization 
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are those of Lazard Group LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as  Lazard Group  or the  Company ).  Lazard Group is a Delaware limited liability company and is governed by an Amended and Restated Operating Agreement dated as of October 26, 2015, as amended (the  Operating Agreement ). 
 Lazard Ltd, a Bermuda holding company, and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as  Lazard Ltd ), including its indirect investment in Lazard Group,  is one of the world s preeminent financial advisory and asset management firms and has long specialized in crafting solutions to the complex financial and strategic challenges of our clients. We serve a diverse set of clients around the world, including corporations, governments, institutions, partnerships and individuals. 
 Lazard Ltd indirectly held 100% of all outstanding Lazard Group common membership interests as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Lazard Ltd, through its control of the managing members of Lazard Group, controls Lazard Group. 
 Lazard Group s principal operating activities are included in two business segments: 

Financial Advisory, which offers corporate, partnership, institutional, government, sovereign and individual clients across the globe a wide array of financial advisory services regarding mergers and acquisitions ( M A ) and other strategic matters, restructurings, capital structure, capital raising, corporate preparedness and various other financial matters, and     

Asset Management, which offers a broad range of global investment solutions and investment management services in equity and fixed income strategies, alternative investments and private equity funds to corporations, public funds, sovereign entities, endowments and foundations, labor funds, financial intermediaries and private clients.     

 In addition, we record selected other activities in our Corporate segment, including management of cash, investments, deferred tax assets, outstanding indebtedness and assets and liabilities associated with Lazard Group s Paris-based subsidiary Lazard Fr res Banque SA ( LFB ). 
 LFB, as a registered bank, is engaged primarily in commercial and private banking services for clients and funds managed by Lazard Fr res Gestion SAS ( LFG ) and other clients, investment banking activities, including participation in underwritten offerings of securities in France, and asset-liability management. 
 Basis of Presentation 
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of Lazard Group have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) regarding interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Lazard Group s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The accompanying December 31, 2015 unaudited condensed consolidated statement of financial condition data was derived from audited consolidated financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for annual financial statement purposes. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. 
 Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts that are reported in the financial statements and the accompanying disclosures. For example, discretionary compensation and benefits expense for interim periods is accrued based on the year-to-date amount of revenue earned, and an assumed annual ratio of compensation and benefits expense to revenue, with the applicable amounts adjusted for certain items. Although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and actions that Lazard may undertake in the future, actual results may differ materially from the estimates. 
 The consolidated results of operations for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 are not indicative of the results to be expected for any future interim or annual period.

 LAZARD GROUP LLC 
 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) 
 (UNAUDITED) 
 (dollars in thousands, unless otherwise noted) 
   
    The condensed consolidated financial statements include Lazard Group and Lazard Group s principal operating subsidiaries: Lazard Fr res   Co. LLC ( LFNY ), a New York limited liability company, along with its subsidiaries, including Lazard Asset Management   LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as  LAM  the French limited liability companies Compagnie Financi re Lazard Fr res SAS ( CFLF ) along with its subsidiaries, LFB and LFG, and Maison Lazard SAS and its subsidiaries; and Lazard   Co., Li  mited ( LCL ), through Lazard   Co., Holdings Limited ( LCH ), an English private limited company, together with their jointly owned affiliates and subsidiaries.  
 The Company s policy is to consolidate entities in which it has a controlling financial interest. The Company consolidates: 

Voting interest entities ( VOEs ) where the Company holds a majority of the voting interest in such VOEs, and     

Variable interest entities ( VIEs ) where the Company is the primary beneficiary having the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of, or receive benefits from, the VIE that could be potentially significant to the VIE.     

 When the Company does not have a controlling interest in an entity, but exerts significant influence over such entity s operating and financial decisions, the Company applies the equity method of accounting in which it records in earnings its share of earnings or losses of the entity. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. 
 Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation, primarily as a result of the adoption of the current guidance on classification of debt issuance costs and the impact of such guidance on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.

 RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS    

 Revenue from Contracts with Customers  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued comprehensive new revenue recognition guidance. The guidance requires a company to recognize revenue when it transfers promised services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services and requires enhanced disclosures. The new guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is not permitted. On July 9, 2015, the FASB approved the deferral of the effective date of the new revenue guidance by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption being permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. During 2016, the FASB issued additional clarifications for certain aspects of the new revenue recognition guidance. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance.  
 Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  In February 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance for the consolidation of certain legal entities. The updated guidance eliminates the deferral of certain consolidation standards for entities considered to be investment companies and modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or VOEs. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this guidance using the modified retrospective method with an effective adoption date of January 1, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.  
 Interest Imputation of Interest  In April 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance which requires a company to classify debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The new guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted and is to be applied on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this guidance by the Company in the first quarter of 2016 resulted in a reclassification as of December 31, 2015 of $8,992 from  other assets  to  senior debt  on our condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.  
 Intangibles Goodwill and Other Internal-Use Software :  Customers Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement  In April 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance providing clarification on whether a cloud computing arrangement that contains a software license should be accounted for as internal-use software. The new guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance by the Company in the first quarter of 2016 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

    Fair Value Measurement   In May 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance for the classification and disclosure of certain investments using the net as  set value ( NAV ) as a practical expedient to measure the fair value of the investment. The guidance removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using NAV as a practical expedient.   The new guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The new guidance is to be applied on a retrospective basis. The Company elected to early adopt this guidance in   the quarter ended September 30, 2015 and has removed investments that are measured at NAV as a practical expedient from the fair value hierarchy in all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
 Leases  In February 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance for leases. The guidance requires a lessee to (i) recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in the statement of financial condition, (ii) recognize a single lease cost, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term on a generally straight-line basis, and (iii) classify all cash payments within operating activities in the statement of cash flows. The new guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The new guidance is to be applied on a modified retrospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance.  
 Compensation Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  In March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance regarding equity-based incentive compensation. The new guidance includes several amendments which affect various aspects of the accounting for equity-based incentive compensation transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The new guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance.  
 Financial Instruments Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance regarding the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. The new guidance replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in the current guidance with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to determine credit loss estimates. The new guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance.  
 Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  In August 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance which clarifies how a company should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows. The new guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted. The new guidance is to be applied on a retrospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance.

 RECEIVABLES    

 The Company s receivables represent fee receivables, amounts due from customers and other receivables and amounts due from Lazard Ltd subsidiaries. 
 Receivables are stated net of an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts, for past due amounts and for specific accounts deemed uncollectible, which may include situations where a fee is in dispute. Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was as follows: 

Bad debt expense, net of recoveries is included in  investment banking and other advisory fees  on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 11 
 
 LAZARD GROUP LLC 
 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) 
 (UNAUDITED) 
 (dollars in thousands, unless otherwise noted) 
   
    At Septemb  er 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had receivables past due or deemed uncollectible of $21,580 and $19,923, respectively.  
 Of the Company s fee receivables at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $77,056 and $81,774, respectively, represented interest-bearing financing receivables. In addition, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had interest-bearing receivables from Lazard Ltd subsidiaries of $16,642 and $106,567, respectively.  Based upon our historical loss experience, the credit quality of the counterparties, and the lack of past due or uncollectible amounts, there was no allowance for doubtful accounts required at those dates related to such receivables. 
 The aggregate carrying amount of our non-interest bearing receivables of $470,298 and $417,689 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, approximates fair value. 

4.   
 
 INVESTMENTS    

 The Company s investments and securities sold, not yet purchased, consist of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

(a)   
 
 Interests in alternative investment funds, debt funds and equity funds include investments with fair values of $15,011, $38,071 and $129,530, respectively, at September 30, 2016 and $10,996, $31,598 and $156,081, respectively, at December 31, 2015, held in order to satisfy the Company s liability upon vesting of previously granted Lazard Fund Interests ( LFI ) and other similar deferred compensation arrangements. LFI represent grants by the Company to eligible employees of actual or notional interests in a number of Lazard-managed funds, subject to service-based vesting conditions (see Notes 6 and 12).    

 Interest-bearing deposits have original maturities of greater than three months but equal to or less than one year and are carried at cost that approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities. 
 Equities primarily consist of seed investments invested in marketable equity securities of large-, mid- and small-cap domestic, international and global companies held within separately managed accounts related to our Asset Management business. 
 Alternative investment funds primarily consist of interests in various Lazard-managed hedge funds, funds of funds and mutual funds. 
 Debt funds primarily consist of seed investments in funds related to our Asset Management business that invest in debt securities, amounts related to LFI discussed above and an investment in a Lazard-managed debt fund. 
 12 
 
 LAZARD GROUP LLC 
 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) 
 (UNAUDITED) 
 (dollars in thousands, unless otherwise noted) 
   
    Equity funds primarily consist of seed i  nvestments in funds related to our Asset Management business that invest in equity securities, and amounts related to LFI discussed above.  
 Private equity investments include those owned by Lazard and those consolidated but not owned by Lazard. Private equity investments owned by Lazard are primarily comprised of investments in private equity funds. Such investments primarily include (i) Edgewater Growth Capital Partners III, L.P. ( EGCP III ), a fund primarily making equity and buyout investments in middle market companies, (ii) until the fourth quarter of 2015, Lazard Australia Corporate Opportunities Fund 2 ( COF2 ), an Australian fund targeting Australian mid-market investments, (iii) a mezzanine fund, which invests in mezzanine debt of a diversified selection of small- to mid-cap European companies, and (iv) a fund targeting significant noncontrolling-stake investments in established private companies. The Company disposed of its private equity business in Australia in the second quarter of 2015 in a transaction with the management of the disposed business. Revenue of $24,388 relating to the disposal of the business primarily represents the realization of carried interest at fair value and is included in  revenue-other  on the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. 
 Private equity investments consolidated but not owned by Lazard relate to the economic interests that are owned by the management team and other investors in the Edgewater Funds ( Edgewater ). 
 During the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company reported in  revenue-other  on its condensed consolidated statements of operations net unrealized investment gains and losses pertaining to  trading  securities still held as of the reporting date as follows: 

5.   
 
 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS    

 Fair Value Hierarchy of Investments and Certain Other Assets and Liabilities  Lazard categorizes its investments and certain other assets and liabilities recorded at fair value into a three-level fair value hierarchy as follows:  

Level 1.      
 
  Assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that Lazard has the ability to access.     

Level 2.   
 
  Assets and liabilities whose values are based on (i) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets, or (ii) inputs other than quoted prices that are directly observable or derived principally from, or corroborated by, market data.     

Level 3.   
 
  Assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. These inputs reflect our own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. Items included in Level 3 include securities or other financial assets whose trading volume and level of activity have significantly decreased when compared with normal market activity and there is no longer sufficient frequency or volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.     

 The Company s investments in debt securities and securities sold, not yet purchased are classified as Level 1 when their respective fair values are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets. 
 The fair value of equities is classified as Level 1 or Level 3 as follows: marketable equity securities are classified as Level 1 and are valued based on the last trade price on the primary exchange for that security as provided by external pricing services; equity securities in private companies are generally classified as Level 3. 
 The fair value of investments in alternative investment funds, debt funds and equity funds is classified as Level 1 when the fair values are primarily based on the publicly reported closing price for the fund. 
 The fair value of investments in private equity funds were classified as Level 3 for certain investments that were valued based on a potential transaction value as of September 30, 2015. 
 13 
 
 LAZARD GROUP LLC 
 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) 
 (UNAUDITED) 
 (dollars in thousands, unless otherwise noted) 
   
    The fair values of derivatives entered into by the Company are classified as Level 2 and are based on the values of the related underlying assets, indices or   reference rates as follows: the fair value of forward foreign currency exchange rate contracts is a function of the spot rate and the interest rate differential of the two currencies from the trade date to settlement date; the fair value of total return sw  aps is based on the change in fair values of the related underlying equity security, financial instrument or index and a specified notional holding; the fair value of interest rate swaps is based on the interest rate yield curve; and the fair value of deri  vative liabilities related to LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements is based on the value of the underlying investments, adjusted for forfeitures. See Note 6.  
 Investments Measured at Net Asset Value  As a practical expedient, the Company uses NAV or its equivalent to measure the fair value of certain investments. NAV is primarily determined based on information provided by external fund administrators. The Company s investments valued at NAV as a practical expedient in (i) alternative investment funds, debt funds and equity funds are redeemable in the near term, and (ii) in private equity funds are not redeemable in the near term as a result of redemption restrictions.

 Investment Capital Funding Commitments  At September 30, 2016, the Company s maximum unfunded commitments for capital contributions to investment funds primarily arose from commitments to EGCP III, which amounted to $8,613. The investment period for EGCP III ended on October 12, 2016, after which point the Company s obligation to fund capital contributions for new investments in EGCP III expired.  The Company remains obligated until October 12, 2023 (or any earlier liquidation of EGCP III) to make capital contributions necessary to fund follow-on investments and to pay for fund expenses.

 DERIVATIVES    

 The Company enters into forward foreign currency exchange rate contracts, interest rate swaps, interest rate futures, total return swap contracts on various equity and debt indices and other derivative contracts to economically hedge exposures to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity and debt prices. The Company reports its derivative instruments separately as assets and liabilities unless a legal right of set-off exists under a master netting agreement enforceable by law. The Company s derivative instruments are recorded at their fair value, and are included in  other assets  and  other liabilities  on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. Gains and losses on the Company s derivative instruments not designated as economic hedging instruments are included in  interest income  and  interest expense , respectively, or  revenue-other , depending on the nature of the underlying item, in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 In addition to the derivative instruments described above, the Company records derivative liabilities relating to its obligations pertaining to LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements, the fair value of which is based on the value of the underlying investments, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, and is included in  accrued compensation and benefits  in the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. Changes in the fair value of the derivative liabilities are included in  compensation and benefits  in the condensed consolidated statements of operations, the impact of which equally offsets the changes in the fair value of investments which are currently expected to be delivered upon settlement of LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements, which are reported in  revenue-other  in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

      SENIOR DEBT     

 Senior debt is comprised of the following as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

The table, as of December 31, 2015, reflects the retrospective application of new guidance adopted by the Company for debt issuance costs. See Note 2. 
 On September 25, 2015, Lazard Group entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement for a five-year $150,000 senior revolving credit facility with a group of lenders (the  Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ), which expires in September 2020. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement amended and restated the previous credit agreement dated September 25, 2012. Borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement generally will bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin for specific interest periods determined based on Lazard Group s highest credit rating from an internationally recognized credit agency. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, no amounts were outstanding under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. 
 The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the indenture and the supplemental indentures relating to Lazard Group s senior notes contain certain covenants, events of default and other customary provisions, including a customary make-whole provision in the event of early redemption, where applicable. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with such provisions. All of the Company s senior debt obligations are unsecured. 
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately $164,000 in unused lines of credit available to it, including the credit facility provided under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and unused lines of credit available to LFB of approximately $11,000 (at September 30, 2016 exchange rates).   
 The Company s senior debt at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is carried at historical amounts of $990,488 and $989,358, respectively. At those dates, the fair value of such senior debt was approximately $1,061,000 and $994,000, respectively. The fair value of the Company s senior debt is based on market quotations. The Company s senior debt would be categorized within Level 2 of the hierarchy of fair value measurements if carried at fair value.

 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES    

 Leases  The Company has various leases and other contractual commitments arising in the ordinary course of business.  
   Guarantees  In the normal course of business, LFB provides indemnifications to third parties to protect them in the event of non-performance by its clients. At September 30, 2016, LFB had $3,809 of such indemnifications and held $3,723 of

 LAZARD GROUP LLC 
 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) 
 (UNAUDITED) 
 (dollars in thousands, unless otherwise noted) 
   
  collateral/counter-guarantees to secure these commitments. The Company believes the likelihood of loss with respect to these indemnities is remote. Accordingly, no liability is recorded in the cond  ensed consolidated statement of financial condition.  
 Certain Business Acquisitions  On July 15, 2009, the Company established a private equity business with Edgewater. Edgewater manages funds primarily focused on buy-out and growth equity investments in middle market companies. The acquisition was structured as a purchase by Lazard Group of interests in a holding company that in turn owns interests in the general partner and management company entities of the current Edgewater private equity funds (the  Edgewater Acquisition ). Following the Edgewater Acquisition, Edgewater s leadership team retained a substantial economic interest in such entities.  
 The aggregate fair value of the consideration recognized by the Company at the acquisition date was $61,624. Such consideration consisted of (i) a one-time cash payment, (ii) 1,142,857 shares of Class A common stock (the  Initial Shares ) and (iii) up to 1,142,857 additional shares of Class A common stock (the  Earnout Shares ) that were subject to earnout criteria and payable over time. The Earnout Shares were to be issued only if certain performance thresholds were met. As of December 31, 2015, 913,722 shares were issuable on a contingent basis. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2105, 2,285,714 and 1,371,992 shares, respectively, had been earned and settled because applicable performance thresholds had been satisfied.  During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the delivery of 913,722 shares of Class A common stock resulted in a non-cash tax benefit of $12,653 recorded in deferred tax assets.  
 Other Business Acquisitions   For a business acquired in 2012, at December 31, 2012, 170,988 shares of Class A common stock (including dividend equivalent shares) were issuable on a non-contingent basis. Such shares were delivered in the first quarter of 2013. During the second quarter of 2015, the achievement of certain performance thresholds related to the acquired business were satisfied, resulting in the issuance of 27,316 shares of Class A common stock.  
   Other Commitments  The Company has various other contractual commitments arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, from time to time, each of LFB and LFNY may enter into underwriting commitments in which it will participate as an underwriter. At September 30, 2016, LFB and LFNY had no such underwriting commitments. 
 See Notes 5 and 13 for information regarding commitments relating to investment capital funding commitments and obligations to fund our pension plans, respectively. 
 In the opinion of management, the fulfillment of the commitments described herein will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s condensed consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
 Legal  The Company is involved from time to time in judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings and inquiries concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of our businesses, including proceedings initiated by former employees alleging wrongful termination. The Company reviews such matters on a case-by-case basis and establishes any required accrual if a loss is probable and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company experiences significant variation in its revenue and earnings on a quarterly basis. Accordingly, the results of any pending matter or matters could be significant when compared to the Company s earnings in any particular fiscal quarter. The Company believes, however, based on currently available information, that the results of any pending matters, in the aggregate, will not have a material effect on its business or financial condition.

Lazard Group Distributions  Distributions in respect of Lazard Group s common membership interests are allocated to the holders of such interests in accordance with the provisions of the Operating Agreement.  Such distributions primarily represent amounts necessary to fund (i) any dividends Lazard Ltd may declare on its Class A common stock and (ii) tax distributions in respect of income taxes that Lazard Ltd s subsidiaries incur.  
 During the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Lazard Group distributed $248,742 and $85,435, respectively, to the subsidiaries of Lazard Ltd. 
 Pursuant to Lazard Group s Operating Agreement, Lazard Group allocates and distributes to its members a substantial portion of its distributable profits in installments, as soon as practicable after the end of each fiscal year.  Such installment distributions usually begin in February. 
 Share Repurchase Program  During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 and since 2013, the Board of Directors of Lazard authorized the repurchase of Class A common stock as set forth in the table below.  

The Company expects that the share repurchase program will primarily be used to offset a portion of the shares that have been or will be issued under the Lazard Ltd 2008 Incentive Compensation Plan (the  2008 Plan ) and the Lazard Ltd 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2005 Plan ). Pursuant to the share repurchase program, purchases have been made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The rate at which the Company purchases shares in connection with the share repurchase program may vary from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors. Purchases with respect to such program are set forth in the table below: 

During the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, certain of our executive officers received Lazard Ltd Class A common stock in connection with the vesting of previously-granted deferred equity incentive awards. The vesting of such equity awards gave rise to a tax payable by the executive officers, and, consistent with our past practice, the Company purchased shares of Lazard Ltd Class A common stock from the executive officers equal in value to the estimated amount of such tax. In addition, during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company purchased shares of Lazard Ltd Class A common stock from an executive officer. The aggregate value of all such purchases during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $4,900 and $17,700, respectively. 
   
 During the nine month period ended September 30, 2015, Lazard Group purchased 605,192 shares of Lazard Ltd Class A common stock from subsidiaries of Lazard Ltd for $32,601.  There were no such purchases during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016.  
 As of September 30, 2016, a total of $190,477 of share repurchase authorization remained available under Lazard Ltd s share repurchase program, which will expire on December 31, 2017. 
 During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, Lazard Ltd had in place trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, pursuant to which it effected stock repurchases in the open market.

Share-Based Incentive Plan Awards 
 A description of Lazard Ltd s 2008 Plan and 2005 Plan and activity with respect thereto during the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is presented below. 
 Shares Available Under the 2008 Plan and 2005 Plan 
 The 2008 Plan authorizes the issuance of shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the grant or exercise of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units ( RSUs ) and other equity-based awards. Under the 2008 Plan, the maximum number of shares available is based on a formula that limits the aggregate number of shares that may, at any time, be subject to awards that are considered  outstanding  under the 2008 Plan to 30% of the then-outstanding shares of Class A common stock. 
 The 2005 Plan authorized the issuance of up to 25,000,000 shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the grant or exercise of stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSUs and other equity-based awards. Each RSU or similar award granted under the 2005 Plan represents a contingent right to receive one share of Class A common stock, at no cost to the recipient. The fair value of such awards is generally determined based on the closing market price of Class A common stock at the date of grant. The 2005 Plan expired in the second quarter of 2015, although unvested awards granted under the 2005 Plan remain outstanding and continue to be subject to its terms.

    The following reflects the amortization expense recorded with respect to share-based incentive plans within  compensation and benefits  expense (with respect to RS  Us, performance-based restricted stock units ( PRSUs ) and restricted stock awards) and  professional services  expense (with respect to deferred stock units ( DSUs )) within the Company s accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for th  e three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

The ultimate amount of compensation and benefits expense relating to share-based awards is dependent upon the actual number of shares of Class A common stock that vest. The Company periodically assesses the forfeiture rates used for such estimates, including as a result of any applicable performance conditions. A change in estimated forfeiture rates results in a cumulative adjustment to previously recorded compensation and benefits expense and also would cause the aggregate amount of compensation expense recognized in future periods to differ from the estimated unrecognized compensation expense described below. 
 The Company s share-based incentive plans and awards are described below. 
 RSUs and DSUs 
 RSUs generally require future service as a condition for the delivery of the underlying shares of Class A common stock (unless the recipient is then eligible for retirement under the Company s retirement policy) and convert into shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis after the stipulated vesting periods. PRSUs, which are RSUs that are also subject to service-based vesting conditions, have additional performance conditions, and are described below. The grant date fair value of the RSUs, net of an estimated forfeiture rate, is amortized over the vesting periods or requisite service periods (generally one-third after two years, and the remaining two-thirds after the third year), and is adjusted for actual forfeitures over such period. 
 RSUs generally include a dividend participation right that provides that during vesting periods each RSU is attributed additional RSUs (or fractions thereof) equivalent to any dividends paid on Class A common stock during such period. During the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, dividend participation rights required the issuance of 969,054 and 603,608 RSUs, respectively.  
   
 Non-executive members of the Board of Directors of Lazard Group, who are the same Non-Executive Directors of Lazard Ltd ( Non-Executive Directors ), receive approximately 55% of their annual compensation for service on the Board of Directors and its committees in the form of DSUs, which resulted in 38,771 and 23,961 DSUs granted in connection with annual compensation during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Their remaining compensation is payable in cash, which they may elect to receive in the form of additional DSUs under the Directors  Fee Deferral Unit Plan described below. DSUs are convertible into shares of Class A common stock at the time of cessation of service to the Board of Directors. DSUs include a cash dividend participation right equivalent to dividends paid on Class A common stock. 
 The Company s Directors  Fee Deferral Unit Plan permits the Non-Executive Directors to elect to receive additional DSUs in lieu of some or all of their cash fees. The number of DSUs granted to a Non-Executive Director pursuant to this election will equal the value of cash fees that the applicable Non-Executive Director has elected to forego pursuant to such election, divided by the market value of a share of Class A common stock on the date immediately preceding the date of the grant. During the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, 7,407 and 1,761 DSUs, respectively, had been granted pursuant to such Plan. 
 DSU awards are expensed at their fair value on their date of grant, inclusive of amounts related to the Directors  Fee Deferral Unit Plan.

    The following   is a summary of activity relating to RSUs and DSUs during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

In connection with RSUs that vested during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company satisfied its minimum statutory tax withholding requirements in lieu of delivering 1,416,643 and 1,940,996 shares of Class A common stock during such respective nine month periods. Accordingly, 3,110,916 and 5,218,646 shares of Class A common stock held by the Company were delivered during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2016, estimated unrecognized RSU compensation expense was approximately $174,364, with such expense expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 0.9 years subsequent to September 30, 2016. 
 Restricted Stock 
 The following is a summary of activity related to shares of restricted Class A common stock associated with compensation arrangements during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

In connection with shares of restricted Class A common stock that vested during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company satisfied its minimum statutory tax withholding requirements in lieu of delivering 132,984 and 94,745 shares of Class A common stock during such respective nine month periods. Accordingly, 669,292 and 417,771 shares of Class A common stock held by the Company were delivered during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 26 
 
 LAZARD GROUP LLC 
 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) 
 (UNAUDITED) 
 (dollars in thousands, unless otherwise noted) 
   
    The   restricted stock awards include a cash dividend participation right equivalent to dividends paid on Class A common stock during the period, which will vest concurrently with the underlying restricted stock award. At September 30, 2016, estimated unrecogniz  ed restricted stock expense was approximately $38,512, with such expense to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.0 years subsequent to September 30, 2016.  
 PRSUs 
 PRSUs are subject to both performance-based and service-based vesting conditions. The number of shares of Class A common stock that a recipient will receive upon vesting of a PRSU will be calculated by reference to certain performance metrics that relate to Lazard Ltd s performance over a three-year period. The target number of shares of Class A common stock subject to each PRSU is one; however, based on the achievement of the performance criteria, the number of shares of Class A common stock that may be received in connection with each PRSU generally can range from zero to two times the target number. PRSUs will vest on a single date three years following the date of the grant, provided the applicable service and performance conditions are satisfied. However, PRSUs granted in 2013 vested 33% in March 2015 and 67% in March 2016. In addition, the performance metrics applicable to each PRSU will be evaluated on an annual basis at the end of each fiscal year during the performance period and, if Lazard Ltd has achieved a threshold level of performance with respect to the fiscal year, 25% of the target number of shares of Class A common stock subject to each PRSU will no longer be at risk of forfeiture based on the achievement of performance criteria. PRSUs include dividend participation rights that provide that during vesting periods the target number of PRSUs (or, following the relevant performance period, the actual number of shares of Class A common stock that are no longer subject to performance conditions) receive dividend equivalents at the same rate that dividends are paid on Class A common stock during such period. These dividend equivalents are credited as RSUs that are not subject to the performance-based vesting criteria but are otherwise subject to the same restrictions as the underlying PRSUs to which they relate. 
 The following is a summary of activity relating to PRSUs during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

(a)   
 
 Represents PRSU awards granted during the relevant year at the target payout level.    

 In connection with PRSUs that vested during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company satisfied its minimum statutory tax withholding requirements in lieu of delivering 64,169 and 32,086 shares of Class A common stock during such respective nine month periods. Accordingly, 352,852 and 664,413 shares of Class A common stock held by the Company were delivered during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
 Compensation expense recognized for PRSU awards is determined by multiplying the number of shares of Class A common stock underlying such awards that, based on the Company s estimate, are considered probable of vesting, by the grant date fair value. As of September 30, 2016, the total estimated unrecognized compensation expense was approximately $17,330, and the Company expects to amortize such expense over a weighted-average period of approximately 0.7 years subsequent to September 30, 2016. 
 LFI and Other Similar Deferred Compensation Arrangements 
   Commencing in February 2011, the Company granted LFI to eligible employees. In connection with LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements, which generally require future service as a condition for vesting, the Company recorded a

  prepaid compensation asset an  d a corresponding compensation liability on the grant date based upon the fair value of the award. The prepaid asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over the applicable vesting periods or requisite service periods (which are generally similar to the   comparable periods for RSUs), and is charged to  compensation and benefits  expense within the Company s condensed consolidated statement of operations. LFI and similar deferred compensation arrangements that do not require future service are expensed imme  diately. The related compensation liability is accounted for at fair value as a derivative liability, which contemplates the impact of estimated forfeitures, and is adjusted for changes in fair value primarily related to changes in value of the underlying   investments.  
 The following is a summary of activity relating to LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

The amortization of the prepaid compensation asset will generally be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 0.8 years subsequent to September 30, 2016.

      EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS     

 The Company provides retirement and other post-retirement benefits to certain of its employees through defined benefit pension plans (the  pension plans ) and, in the U.S., a partially funded contributory post-retirement plan covering qualifying U.S. employees (the  medical plan  and together with the pension plans, the  post-retirement plans ). The Company also offers defined contribution plans to its employees. The post-retirement plans generally provide benefits to participants based on average levels of compensation. Expenses related to the Company s employee benefit plans are included in  compensation and benefits  expense on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 Employer Contributions to Pension Plans  The Company s funding policy for its U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans is to fund when required or when applicable upon an agreement with the plans  trustees. Management also evaluates from time to time whether to make voluntary contributions to the plans.  
 The following table summarizes the components of net periodic benefit cost (credit) related to the Company s post-retirement plans for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Although a portion of Lazard Group s income is subject to U.S. federal income taxes, Lazard Group primarily operates in the U.S. as a limited liability company that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  As a result, Lazard Group s income from its U.S. operations is generally not subject to U.S. federal income taxes because such income is attributable to its partners. Outside the U.S., Lazard Group operates principally through subsidiary corporations that are subject to local income taxes in foreign jurisdictions. Lazard Group is also subject to New York City Unincorporated Business Tax ( UBT ) attributable to its operations apportioned to New York City. 
   The Company recorded income tax provisions of $21,653 and $49,110 for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $26,987 and $52,909 for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 14.5%, 13.6%, 18.0% and 13.5%, respectively. The difference between the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35.0% and the effective tax rates reflected above principally relates to (i) Lazard Group primarily operating as a limited liability company in the U.S., (ii) change in the valuation allowance affecting the provision for income taxes, (iii) taxes

  payable to foreign jurisdictions and (iv)   U.S. state and local taxes (primarily UBT), which are incremental to the U.S. federal statutory tax rate.  
 Substantially all of Lazard s operations outside the U.S. are conducted in  pass-through  entities for U.S. income tax purposes. The Company provides for U.S. income taxes on a current basis for the relevant portion of  those earnings. The repatriation of prior earnings attributable to  non-pass-through  entities would not result in the recognition of a material amount of additional U.S. income taxes. 

Receivable from and Payable to Lazard Ltd Subsidiaries 
 Lazard Group s receivables from subsidiaries of Lazard Ltd at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 included interest- bearing loans of $16,642 and $106,567, respectively, including accrued interest thereon.  Interest income relating to interest-bearing loans with subsidiaries of Lazard Ltd amounted to $23 and $233 for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and $164 for both the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015.  
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Lazard Group s payables to subsidiaries of Lazard Ltd included interest-bearing loans, including interest thereon, of approximately $63,000 and $102,000, respectively.  Interest expense relating to interest-bearing loans with subsidiaries of Lazard Ltd amounted to $875 and $2,604 for the three month and nine month periods ended September 2016, respectively, and $941 and $2,987 for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015, respectively.   
 Sponsored Funds 
 The Company serves as an investment advisor for certain affiliated investment companies and fund entities and receives management fees and, for the alternative investment funds, performance fees for providing such services. Investment advisory fees relating to such services were $130,546 and $374,250 for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $129,524 and $405,145 for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015, respectively, and are included in  asset management fees  on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Of such amounts, $54,979 and $42,002 remained as receivables at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and are included in  fees receivable  on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.

          Management s Discussion and Analysis of   Financial Condition and Results of Operations     

 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Lazard Group s condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the  Form 10-Q ), as well as Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the  Form 10-K ). All references to  2016,   2015,   third quarter,   first nine months  or  the period  refer to, as the context requires, the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. 
 Forward-Looking Statements and Certain Factors that May Affect Our Business 
 Management has included in Parts I and II of this Form 10-Q, including in its MD A, statements that are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as  may,   might,   will,   should,   could,   would,   expect,   plan,   anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   predict,   potential,   target,   goal  or  continue,  and the negative of these terms and other comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements, which are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us, may include projections of our future financial performance based on our growth strategies, business plans and initiatives and anticipated trends in our business. These statements are only predictions based on our current expectations and projections about future events. There are important factors that could cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from the results, level of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to, those discussed in our Form 10-K and in our Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016 under the caption  Risk Factors,  including the following: 

a decline in general economic conditions or global or regional financial markets;     

a decline in our revenues, for example due to a decline in overall mergers and acquisitions ( M A ) activity, our share of the M A market or our assets under management ( AUM      

losses caused by financial or other problems experienced by third parties;     

losses due to unidentified or unanticipated risks;     

a lack of liquidity,   i.e  ., ready access to funds, for use in our businesses; and     

competitive pressure on our businesses and on our ability to retain and attract employees at current compensation levels.     

 These risks and uncertainties are not exhaustive. Other sections of the Form 10-K and our Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016 and this Form 10-Q describe additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for our management to predict all risks and uncertainties, nor can management assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. 
 Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, level of activity, performance or achievements. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any of these forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We are under no duty to update any of these forward-looking statements after the date of this Form 10-Q to conform our prior statements to actual results or revised expectations and we do not intend to do so. 
 Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about: 

financial goals, including the ratio of awarded compensation and benefits expense to operating revenue;     

ability to deploy surplus cash through distributions to members, purchases of Lazard Ltd Class A common stock and debt repurchases;     

possible or assumed future results of operations and operating cash flows;

likelihood of success and impact of litigation;     

expected tax rates, including effective tax rates;     

changes in interest and tax rates;

 Business Summary 
 Lazard is one of the world s preeminent financial advisory and asset management firms. We have long specialized in crafting solutions to the complex financial and strategic challenges of a diverse set of clients around the world, including corporations, governments, institutions, partnerships and individuals. Founded in 1848 in New Orleans, we currently operate from 42 cities in key business and financial centers across 27 countries throughout North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, the Middle East, and Central and South America. 
 Our primary business purpose is to serve our clients. Our deep roots in business centers around the world form a global network of relationships with key decision-makers in corporations, governments and investing institutions. This network is both a competitive strength and a powerful resource for Lazard and our clients. As a firm that competes on the quality of our advice, we have two fundamental assets: our people and our reputation. 
 We operate in cyclical businesses across multiple geographies, industries and asset classes. In recent years, we have expanded our geographic reach, bolstered our industry expertise and continued to build in growth areas. Companies, government bodies and investors seek independent advice with a geographic perspective, deep understanding of capital structure, informed research and knowledge of global economic conditions. We believe that our business model as an independent advisor will continue to create opportunities for us to attract new clients and key personnel. 
 Our principal sources of revenue are derived from activities in the following business segments: 

Financial Advisory, which offers corporate, partnership, institutional, government, sovereign and individual clients across the globe a wide array of financial advisory services regarding M A and other strategic matters, restructurings, capital structure, capital raising, corporate preparedness and various other financial matters, and     

Asset Management, which offers a broad range of global investment solutions and investment management services in equity and fixed income strategies, alternative investments and private equity funds to corporations, public funds, sovereign entities, endowments and foundations, labor funds, financial intermediaries and private clients.     

 34 

In addition, we record selected other activi  ties in our Corporate segment, including management of cash, investments, deferred tax assets, outstanding indebtedness and assets and liabilities associated with Lazard Group s Paris-based subsidiary, Lazard Fr res Banque SA ( LFB ).  
 LFB, as a registered bank, is engaged primarily in commercial and private banking services for clients and funds managed by LFG and other clients, investment banking activities, including participation in underwritten offerings of securities in France, and asset-liability management. 
 Our consolidated net revenue was derived from the following segments: 

We also invest our own capital from time to time, generally alongside capital of qualified institutional and individual investors in alternative investments or private equity investments, and, since 2005, we have engaged in a number of alternative investments and private equity activities, including, historically, investments through (i) the Edgewater Funds ( Edgewater ), our Chicago-based private equity firm (see Note 10 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements), (ii) a mezzanine fund, which invests in mezzanine debt of a diversified selection of small-to mid-cap European companies and (iii) a fund targeting significant noncontrolling-stake investments in established private companies. We also make investments to seed our Asset Management strategies. 
 Business Environment and Outlook 
 Economic and global financial market conditions can materially affect our financial performance. As described above, our principal sources of revenue are derived from activities in our Financial Advisory and Asset Management business segments. As our Financial Advisory revenues are primarily dependent on the successful completion of merger, acquisition, restructuring, capital raising or similar transactions, and our Asset Management revenues are primarily driven by the levels of AUM, weak economic and global financial market conditions can result in a challenging business environment for M A and capital-raising activity as well as our Asset Management business, but may provide opportunities for our restructuring business. 
 Equity market indices for developed markets at September 30, 2016 were mixed, with U.S. indices generally increasing and European indices generally decreasing as compared to such indices at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015. Emerging markets equity indices at September 30, 2016 increased as compared to September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015. In the global M A markets during the first nine months of 2016, the value and number of all completed M A transactions decreased as compared to the same period in the prior year, as did the subset of such transactions involving values greater than $500 million. During the same time, the value and number of all announced M A transactions, including the subset of such transactions involving values greater than $500 million, also decreased. During the first nine months of 2016, global restructuring activity, as measured by the number of corporate defaults, increased as compared to the first nine months of 2015, primarily due to a higher level of defaults in the commodity sector. 
 In the first nine months of 2016, volatile market conditions continued. On an ongoing basis, volatile conditions may persist, and regional macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including the United Kingdom s vote to leave the European Union, may impact our business. However, corporate cash balances remain high, and interest rates remain low for companies with strong credit ratings. Although market volatility may continue and may affect our business in 2016, the longer-term trends appear to remain favorable for both of our businesses. 
 Our outlook with respect to our Financial Advisory and Asset Management businesses is described below. 

Financial Advisory   The fundamentals for continued M A activity appear to remain in place. Demand continues for expert, independent strategic advice that can be levered across geographies and our range of advisory capabilities. The global scale and breadth of our Financial Advisory business allows us to advise on large, complex cross-border transactions across a variety of industries. In addition, we believe our businesses throughout the emerging markets position us for growth in these markets, while enhancing our relationships with, and the services that we can provide to, clients in other economies. In the third quarter of 2016, Lazard Ltd expanded its North American Financial Advisory business through the      

 35 

acquisition of an independent financial advisory firm based   in Canada.  In addition, in October 2016, we acquired the portion of MBA Lazard that we did not already own, thereby fully integrating our Latin American operations. We believe that these transactions have augmented the strength of our Financial Advisory b  usiness throughout the Americas.     

Asset Management   In the short to intermediate term, we expect most investor demand will come from defined benefit and defined contribution plans in the developed economies because of their sheer scope and size. Over the longer term, we expect an increasing share of our AUM to come from the developing economies in Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, as their retirement systems evolve and individual wealth is increasingly deployed in the financial markets. Our global footprint is already well established in the developed economies and we expect our business in the developing economies will continue to expand. Given our globally diversified platform and our ability to provide investment solutions for a global mix of clients, we believe we are positioned to benefit from growth that may occur in the asset management industry. In recent years, we have expanded the global footprint of our Asset Management business by opening offices in Singapore, Dubai and Dublin. We are continually developing and seeding new investment strategies that extend our existing platforms. Recent examples of growth initiatives include the following investment strategies: European Long/Short Equity, various Quantitative Equity strategies, various Multi-Asset strategies and Middle East North African Equities.     

 We operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge continuously, and it is not possible for our management to predict all risks and uncertainties, nor can we assess the impact of all potentially applicable factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. See Item 1A,  Risk Factors  in our Form 10-K and our Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016. Furthermore, net income and revenue in any period may not be indicative of full-year results or the results of any other period and may vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter. 
 Overall, we continue to focus on the development of our business, including the generation of stable revenue growth, earnings growth and member returns, the prudent management of our costs and expenses, the efficient use of our assets and the return of equity to our members. 
 Certain data with respect to our Financial Advisory and Asset Management businesses is included below. 
 Financial Advisory 
 As reflected in the following table, which sets forth global M A industry statistics, the value and number of all completed transactions, including completed transactions with values greater than $500 million, decreased in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to 2015. With respect to announced M A transactions, the value and number of all transactions, including announced transactions with values greater than $500 million, also decreased in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to 2015. 

Source: Dealogic as of October 4, 2016. 
 36 

Global restructuring activity during the first nine months of 2016, as   measured by the number of corporate defaults, increased as compared to the first nine months of 2015. The number of defaulting issuers increased to 115 in the first nine months of 2016, according to Moody s Investors Service, Inc., as compared to 68 in the   first nine months of 2015, primarily due to a higher level of defaults in the commodity sector.  
 Net revenue trends in Financial Advisory for M A and Other Advisory and Restructuring are generally correlated to the level of completed industry-wide M A transactions and restructuring transactions occurring subsequent to corporate debt defaults, respectively. However, deviations from this relationship can occur in any given year for a number of reasons. For instance, our results can diverge from industry-wide activity where there are material variances from the level of industry-wide M A activity in a particular market where Lazard has significant market share, or regarding the relative number of our advisory engagements with respect to larger-sized transactions, and where we are involved in non-public or sovereign advisory assignments. For example, our M A and Other Advisory revenue, which includes Sovereign and Capital Structure Advisory revenue, decreased 15% in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to 2015. The industry statistics for global M A transactions described above reflect a 13% and 14% decrease in the value and number, respectively, of all completed transactions in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to 2015. For M A deals with values greater than $500 million, the value and number of completed transactions in the first nine months of 2016 decreased 14% and 15%, respectively, as compared to 2015. 
 Asset Management 
 The percentage change in major equity market indices at September 30, 2016, as compared to such indices at June 30, 2016, December 31, 2015, and at September 30, 2015, is shown in the table below. 

The fees that we receive for providing investment management and advisory services are primarily driven by the level of AUM and the nature of the AUM product mix. Accordingly, market movements, foreign currency exchange rate volatility and changes in our AUM product mix will impact the level of revenues we receive from our Asset Management business when comparing periodic results. A substantial portion of our AUM is invested in equities. Movements in AUM during the period generally reflect the changes in equity market indices. Our AUM at September 30, 2016 increased 10% versus AUM at December 31, 2015, primarily due to market and foreign exchange appreciation and net inflows. Average AUM for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 was 5% higher than average AUM for the three month period ended September 30, 2015.  Average AUM for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was 3% lower than average AUM for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. 
 Financial Statement Overview 
 Net Revenue 
 The majority of Lazard s Financial Advisory net revenue historically has been earned from the successful completion of M A transactions, strategic advisory matters, restructuring and capital structure advisory services, capital raising and similar transactions. The main drivers of Financial Advisory net revenue are overall M A activity, the level of corporate debt defaults and the environment for capital raising activities, particularly in the industries and geographic markets in which Lazard focuses. In some client engagements, often those involving financially distressed companies, revenue is earned in the form of retainers and similar fees that are contractually agreed upon with each client for each assignment and are not necessarily linked to the completion of a transaction. In addition, Lazard also earns fees from providing strategic advice to clients, with such fees not being dependent on a specific transaction, and may also earn fees in connection with public and private securities offerings. Significant fluctuations in Financial Advisory net revenue can occur over the course of any given year, because a significant portion of such net revenue is earned upon the successful completion of a transaction, restructuring or capital raising activity, the timing of which is uncertain and is not subject to Lazard s control. 
   Lazard s Asset Management segment principally includes LAM, LFG and Edgewater. Asset Management net revenue is derived from fees for investment management and advisory services provided to clients. As noted above, the main driver of Asset Management net revenue is the level and product mix of AUM, which is generally influenced by the performance of the global equity  
 37 

markets and, to a lesser extent, fixed income markets as well as Lazard s investment performance, which impacts its ability to successfully attract and retain assets. As a result, fluc  tuations (including timing thereof) in financial markets and client asset inflows and outflows have a direct effect on Asset Management net revenue and operating income. Asset Management fees are generally based on the level of AUM measured daily, monthly   or quarterly, and an increase or reduction in AUM, due to market price fluctuations, currency fluctuations, changes in product mix, or net client asset flows will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in management fees. The majority of our invest  ment advisory contracts are generally terminable at any time or on notice of 30 days or less. Institutional and individual clients, and firms with which we have strategic alliances, can terminate their relationship with us, reduce the aggregate amount of A  UM or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for a number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates and financial market performance. In addition, as Lazard s AUM includes signif  icant amounts of assets that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. Dollars, changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies will impact the value of Lazard s AUM. Fees vary with the type of assets managed and the vehicle in w  hich they are managed, with higher fees earned on equity assets and alternative investment funds, such as hedge funds and private equity funds, and lower fees earned on fixed income and cash management products.  
 The Company earns performance-based incentive fees on various investment products, including traditional products and alternative investment funds, such as hedge funds and private equity funds. 
 For hedge funds, incentive fees are calculated based on a specified percentage of a fund s net appreciation, in some cases in excess of established benchmarks or thresholds. The Company records incentive fees on traditional products and hedge funds at the end of the relevant performance measurement period, when potential uncertainties regarding the ultimate realizable amounts have been determined. The incentive fee measurement period is generally an annual period (unless an account terminates or a redemption occurs during the year). The incentive fees received at the end of the measurement period are not subject to reversal or payback. Incentive fees on hedge funds are often subject to loss carryforward provisions in which losses incurred by the hedge funds in any year are applied against certain gains realized by the hedge funds in future periods before any incentive fees can be earned. 
 For private equity funds, incentive fees may be earned in the form of a  carried interest  if profits arising from realized investments exceed a specified threshold. Typically, such carried interest is ultimately calculated on a whole-fund basis and, therefore, clawback of carried interest during the life of the fund can occur. As a result, incentive fees earned on our private equity funds are not recognized until potential uncertainties regarding the ultimate realizable amounts have been determined, including any potential for clawback. 
 Corporate segment net revenue consists primarily of investment gains and losses on the Company s  seed investments  related to our Asset Management business, principal investments in private equity funds and  equity method  investments, net of hedging activities, as well as gains and losses on investments held in connection with Lazard Fund Interests ( LFI ) and interest income and interest expense. Corporate net revenue also can fluctuate due to changes in the fair value of investments classified as  trading , as well as due to changes in interest and currency exchange rates and in the levels of cash, investments and indebtedness. 
 Although Corporate segment net revenue during 2016 is not significant compared to Lazard s net revenue, total assets in the Corporate segment represented 58% of Lazard s consolidated total assets as of September 30, 2016, which are attributable to cash and cash equivalents, investments in debt and equity securities, interests in alternative investment, debt, equity and private equity funds, deferred tax assets and certain assets associated with LFB. 
 Operating Expenses 
 The majority of Lazard s operating expenses relate to compensation and benefits for managing directors and employees. Our compensation and benefits expense includes (i) salaries and benefits, (ii) amortization of the relevant portion of previously granted deferred incentive compensation awards, including (a) share-based incentive compensation under the Lazard Ltd 2008 Incentive Compensation Plan (the  2008 Plan ) and the Lazard Ltd 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2005 Plan ), which expired in the second quarter of 2015, and (b) LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements (see Note 12 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements), (iii) a provision for discretionary or guaranteed cash bonuses and profit pools and (iv) when applicable, severance payments. Compensation expense in any given period is dependent on many factors, including general economic and market conditions, our actual and forecasted operating and financial performance, staffing levels, estimated forfeiture rates, competitive pay conditions and the nature of revenues earned, as well as the mix between current and deferred compensation. 
 38 

For interim periods, we use  adjusted compensation and benefits expense  and the ratio of  adjusted compensation and benefits expense  to  operating revenue,  both non-U.S. GAAP measures, for comparison of compensation and benefits expense betwee  n periods. For the reconciliations and calculations with respect to  adjusted compensation and benefits expense  and related ratios to  operating revenue,  see the table under  Consolidated Results of Operations  below.  
 We believe that  awarded compensation and benefits expense  and the ratio of  awarded compensation and benefits expense  to  operating revenue,  both non-U.S. GAAP measures, are the most appropriate measures to assess the annual cost of compensation and provide the most meaningful basis for comparison of compensation and benefits expense between present, historical and future years.  Awarded compensation and benefits expense  for a given year is calculated using  adjusted compensation and benefits expense,  also a non-U.S. GAAP measure, as modified by the following items: 

We deduct amortization expense recorded for accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) purposes in the fiscal year associated with deferred incentive compensation awards;     

We add incentive compensation with respect to the fiscal year, which is comprised of:     

(i)   
 
 the deferred incentive compensation awards granted in the year-end compensation process with respect to the fiscal year ( e.g . deferred incentive compensation awards granted in 2016 related to the 2015 year-end compensation process), including Performance-based restricted stock unit ( PRSU ) awards (based on the target payout level);    

(ii)   
 
 the portion of investments in people ( e.g .  sign-on  bonuses or retention awards) and other special deferred incentive compensation awards that is applicable to the fiscal year the award becomes effective; and    

(iii)   
 
 amounts in excess of the target payout level for PRSU awards at the end of their respective performance periods; and    

We reduce the amounts in (i), (ii) and (iii) above by an estimate of future forfeitures with respect to such awards; and     

We adjust for year-end foreign exchange fluctuations.     

 Compensation and benefits expense is the largest component of our operating expenses. We seek to maintain discipline with respect to compensation, including the rate at which we award deferred compensation. Our goal is to attain a ratio of awarded compensation and benefits expense to operating revenue and a ratio of adjusted compensation and benefits expense to operating revenue over the cycle in the mid-to-high-50s percentage range, which compares to 55.8% and 55.4%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. While we have implemented initiatives that we believe will assist us in continuing to attain a ratio within this range, there can be no guarantee that such a ratio will be attained, or that our policies or initiatives will not change, in the future. We may benefit from pressure on compensation costs within the financial services industry in future periods; however, increased competition for senior professionals, changes in the macroeconomic environment or the financial markets generally, lower operating revenue resulting from, for example, a decrease in M A activity, our share of the M A market or our AUM levels, changes in the mix of revenues from our businesses or various other factors could prevent us from attaining this goal. 
 Our operating expenses also include  non-compensation expense,  which includes costs for occupancy and equipment, marketing and business development, technology and information services, professional services, fund administration and outsourced services and other expenses. In 2015, non-compensation expense also included the expenses related to the redemption of a significant portion of the Company s 6.85% senior notes due 2017 (the  2017 Notes ) (see Note 9 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 We believe that  adjusted non-compensation expense,  a non-U.S. GAAP measure, provides a more meaningful basis for assessing our operating results. For calculations with respect to  adjusted non-compensation expense,  see the table under  Consolidated Results of Operations  below. 
 Our operating expenses also include  amortization and other acquisition-related costs . For all periods,  amortization and other acquisition-related costs  pertain primarily to the acquisition of Edgewater. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Lazard Group primarily operates in the U.S. as a limited liability company that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  As a result, Lazard Group s income pertaining to the limited liability company is not subject to U.S. federal income tax because taxes associated with such income represent obligations of the individual partners. Outside the U.S., Lazard Group operates principally through subsidiary corporations that are subject to local income taxes in foreign jurisdictions. Lazard Group is also subject to Unincorporated Business Tax ( UBT ) attributable to its operations apportioned to New York City (see Note 14 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). 
 39 

Noncontrolling Interests  
 Noncontrolling interests primarily consist of amounts related to Edgewater s management vehicles that the Company is deemed to control but not own. See Note 11 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company s noncontrolling interests. 
 Consolidated Results of Operations 
 Lazard s condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars. Many of our non-U.S. subsidiaries have a functional currency ( i.e ., the currency in which operational activities are primarily conducted) that is other than the U.S. Dollar, generally the currency of the country in which the subsidiaries are domiciled. Such subsidiaries  assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars using exchange rates as of the respective balance sheet date, while revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the respective periods based on the daily closing exchange rates. Adjustments that result from translating amounts from a subsidiary s functional currency are reported as a component of members  equity. Foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on transactions in non-functional currencies are included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 A portion of our net revenue is derived from transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Since the middle of 2014, the value of the U.S. dollar has strengthened against many other major currencies. As a result, net revenue for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 was negatively impacted in comparison to the prior year period. The majority of the negative impact was offset by the positive impact of the exchange rate movements on our operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. 
 The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Selected financial data from the Company s reported condensed consolidated results of operations is set forth below, followed by a more detailed discussion of both the consolidated and business segment results.

The tables be  low describe the components of operating revenue, adjusted compensation and benefits expense, adjusted non-compensation expense, earnings from operations and related key ratios, which are non-U.S. GAAP measures used by the Company to manage its business. W  e believe such non-U.S. GAAP measures provide the most meaningful basis for comparison between present, historical and future periods, as described above.  

(a)   
 
 Interest expense (excluding interest expense incurred by LFB) is added back in determining operating revenue because such expense relates to corporate financing activities and is not considered to be a cost directly related to the revenue of our business.    

(b)   
 
 Revenue related to the consolidation of noncontrolling interests is excluded from operating revenue because the Company has no economic interest in such amount.    

(c)   
 
 The Company disposed of its private equity business in Australia in the second quarter of 2015 in a transaction with the management team of the disposed business. Revenue of $24,388 relating to the disposal of the business (which primarily represents the realization of carried interest at fair value) is adjusted for the recognition of an obligation of $12,203 with the management of the disposed business, which obligation was previously recognized for U.S. GAAP.    

(d)   
 
 Represents changes in the fair value of investments held in connection with LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements for which a corresponding equal amount is excluded from compensation and benefits expense.    

(a)   
 
 Expenses related to the consolidation of noncontrolling interests are excluded because Lazard has no economic interest in such amounts.    

(b)   
 
 Represents changes in fair value of the compensation liability recorded in connection with LFI and other similar deferred incentive compensation awards for which a corresponding equal amount is excluded from operating revenue.    

 41 

(a)   
 
 Expenses related to the consolidation of noncontrolling interests are excluded because the Company has no economic interest in such amounts.    

(b)   
 
 Charges pertaining to the redemption of a significant portion of the Company s 2017 Notes are excluded because of the non-operating nature of such transactions. See   Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Activities.

Operating Results  
 The Company s quarterly revenue and profits can fluctuate materially depending on the number, size and timing of completed transactions on which it advised, as well as seasonality, the performance of equity markets and other factors. Accordingly, the revenue and profits in any particular quarter may not be indicative of future results. Lazard management believes that annual results are the most meaningful basis for comparison among present, historical and future periods. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 versus September 30, 2015 
 The Company reported net income attributable to Lazard Group of $128 million, as compared to net income of $122 million in the 2015 period.  The changes in the Company s operating results during these periods are described below. 
 Net revenue increased $35 million, or 6%, with operating revenue increasing $16 million, or 3%, as compared to the 2015 period. Fee revenue from investment banking and other advisory activities increased $13 million, or 4%, primarily due to an increase in Restructuring revenue, which generally reflected a higher level of activity in the U.S. energy sector in the 2016 period. Asset management fees, including incentive fees, remained substantially unchanged as compared to the 2015 period. In the aggregate, interest income, other revenue and interest expense increased $22 million as compared to the 2015 period, primarily due to an increase in gains in the 2016 period attributable to investments held in connection with LFI. 
 Compensation and benefits expense increased $34 million, or 11%, as compared to the 2015 period, primarily due to an increase in discretionary compensation and an increase in charges pertaining to LFI. 
 Adjusted compensation and benefits expense (which excludes certain items and which we believe allows for improved comparability between periods, as described above) was $345 million, an increase of $15 million, or 4%, as compared to $330 million in the 2015 period. The ratio of adjusted compensation and benefits expense to operating revenue was 56.5% for the 2016 period, as compared to 55.6% for the 2015 period and 55.4% for full-year 2015.  
 Non-compensation expense increased $1 million, or 1%, as compared to the 2015 period. Adjusted non-compensation expense, which excludes non-compensation costs relating to noncontrolling interests, increased $1 million, or 1%, as compared to the 2015 period. The ratio of adjusted non-compensation expense to operating revenue was 17.0%, as compared to 17.2% in the 2015 period. 
 Amortization and other acquisition-related costs remained substantially unchanged as compared to the 2015 period. 
 Operating income remained substantially unchanged as compared to the 2015 period. 
 Earnings from operations remained substantially unchanged as compared to the 2015 period, and, as a percentage of operating revenue, was 26.6%, as compared to 27.2% in the 2015 period. 
 The provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of 14.5%, as compared to 18.0% for the 2015 period (see Note 14 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). 
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $1 million as compared to the 2015 period. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 versus September 30, 2015 
 The Company reported net income attributable to Lazard Group of $307 million, as compared to net income of $330 million in the 2015 period. The changes in the Company s operating results during these periods are described below. 
 Net revenue decreased $119 million, or 7%, with operating revenue decreasing $123 million, or 7%, as compared to the 2015 period. Fee revenue from investment banking and other advisory activities decreased $51 million, or 5%, primarily due to decreases in M A and Other Advisory fees. The decrease in M A and Other Advisory fee revenue was primarily due to a lower number of M A transactions completed as compared to the 2015 period. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in Restructuring revenue, which generally reflected a higher level of activity in the U.S. energy sector in the 2016 period. Asset management fees, including incentive fees, decreased $55 million, or 7%, as compared to the 2015 period, due to a decrease in average AUM primarily as a result of market depreciation, a change in the mix of AUM and a decrease in incentive fees relating to traditional investment products and mutual funds. In the aggregate, interest income, other revenue and interest expense decreased $13 million as compared to the 2015 period, primarily due to a $24 million gain in the 2015 period on the disposal of the Company s Australian private equity business (which relates primarily to the realization of carried interest at fair value) partially offset by, in the 2016 period, higher gains attributable to investments held in connection with LFI. 
 43 

Compensation and benefits expense decreased $26 million, or 3%, as compared to the 2015 period, primarily due to a decrease in discretionary compensation associated with decreased operating revenue, p  artially offset by an increase in charges pertaining to LFI.  
 Adjusted compensation and benefits expense (which excludes certain items and which we believe allows for improved comparability between periods, as described above) was $949 million, a decrease of $42 million, or 4%, as compared to $991 million in the 2015 period. The ratio of adjusted compensation and benefits expense to operating revenue was 57.2% for the 2016 period, as compared to 55.6% for the 2015 period and 55.4% for full-year 2015. Adjusted compensation and benefits expense in the 2016 period generally reflected lower operating revenue in the 2016 period. 
 Non-compensation expense decreased $60 million, or 16%, as compared to the 2015 period, primarily due to a non-recurring charge of $60 million related to the redemption of a significant portion of the Company s 2017 Notes in the 2015 period. Adjusted non-compensation expense, which excludes such charge, as well as non-compensation costs relating to noncontrolling interests, remained substantially unchanged as compared to the 2015 period. The ratio of adjusted non-compensation expense to operating revenue was 19.0%, as compared to 17.8% in the 2015 period. 
 Amortization and other acquisition-related costs decreased $2 million as compared to the 2015 period. 
 Operating income decreased $31 million as compared to the 2015 period, which included a charge relating to the redemption of a significant portion of the Company s 2017 Notes.  
 Earnings from operations decreased $81 million, or 17%, as compared to the 2015 period, which excluded the charge related to the redemption of a significant portion of the Company s 2017 Notes, and, as a percentage of operating revenue, was 23.7%, as compared to 26.6% in the 2015 period. 
 The provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of 13.6%, as compared to 13.5% for the 2015 period (see Note 14 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). 
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $4 million, as compared to the 2015 period. 
 Reportable Segments 
 The following is a discussion of net revenue and operating income for the Company s segments: Financial Advisory, Asset Management and Corporate. Each segment s operating expenses include (i) compensation and benefits expenses that are incurred directly in support of the segment and (ii) other operating expenses, which include directly incurred expenses for occupancy and equipment, marketing and business development, technology and information services, professional services, fund administration and outsourcing, and indirect support costs (including compensation and benefits expense and other operating expenses related thereto) for administrative services. Such administrative services include, but are not limited to, accounting, tax, human resources, legal, information technology, facilities management and senior management activities. Such support costs are allocated to the relevant segments based on various statistical drivers such as revenue, headcount, square footage and other factors. 
 Financial Advisory 
 The following table summarizes the reported operating results attributable to the Financial Advisory segment: 

44 

Certain fee and transaction statistics for the Financial Advisory segment are set forth below:  

The geographical distribution of Financial Advisory net revenue is set forth below in percentage terms and is based on the Lazard offices that generate Financial Advisory net revenue, which are located in North America, Europe (primarily in the U.K., France, Italy, Spain and Germany) and the rest of the world (primarily in Australia) and therefore may not be reflective of the geography in which the clients are located. 

The Company s managing directors and many of its professionals have significant experience, and many of them are able to use this experience to advise on M A, strategic advisory matters and restructuring transactions, depending on clients  needs. This flexibility allows Lazard to better match its professionals with the counter-cyclical business cycles of mergers and acquisitions and restructurings. While Lazard measures revenue by practice area, Lazard does not separately measure the costs or profitability of M A services as compared to restructuring services. Accordingly, Lazard measures performance in its Financial Advisory segment based on overall segment operating revenue and operating income margins. 
 Financial Advisory Results of Operations 
 Financial Advisory s quarterly revenue and profits can fluctuate materially depending on the number, size and timing of completed transactions on which it advised, as well as seasonality and other factors. Accordingly, the revenue and profits in any particular quarter or period may not be indicative of future results. Lazard management believes that annual results are the most meaningful basis for comparison among present, historical and future periods. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 versus September 30, 2015 
 Financial Advisory net revenue increased $13 million, or 4%, as compared to the 2015 period. Total Strategic Advisory net revenue, representing fees from our M A and Other Advisory and Capital Raising businesses, decreased $13 million, or 4%, and Restructuring revenue increased $26 million, or 99%, as compared to the 2015 period. 
 M A and Other Advisory revenue decreased $6 million, or 2%, while Capital Raising revenue decreased $6 million, or 38%, as compared to the 2015 period. The decrease in M A and Other Advisory revenue was primarily due to a lower number of M A transactions completed as compared to the 2015 period. Clients which in the aggregate represented a significant portion of our M A and Other Advisory revenue in the 2016 period included ARM Holdings, Columbia Pipeline Group, Dentsu Aegis Network, L Oreal, Starwood Hotels   Resorts Worldwide and Tyco International. 
 Restructuring revenue in the 2016 period primarily reflected a higher level of activity in the U.S energy sector in the 2016 period. Clients which in the aggregate represented a significant portion of our Restructuring revenue in the 2016 period included Horsehead Holding, Sabine Oil   Gas and The Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Energy Future Holdings. 
 45 

Operating expenses decreased $4 million, or 2%, as compared to the 2015 period, primarily due to a   decrease in compensation and benefits expense.  
 Financial Advisory operating income was $86 million, an increase of $17 million, or 25%, as compared to operating income of $69 million in the 2015 period and, as a percentage of net revenue, was 25.0%, as compared to 20.8% in the 2015 period. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 versus September 30, 2015 
 Financial Advisory net revenue decreased $52 million, or 6%, as compared to the 2015 period. Total Strategic Advisory net revenue, representing fees from our M A and Other Advisory and Capital Raising businesses, decreased $143 million, or 16%, and Restructuring revenue increased $91 million, or 122%, as compared to the 2015 period. 
 M A and Other Advisory revenue decreased $122 million, or 15%, and Capital Raising revenue decreased $21 million, or 41%, as compared to the 2015 period. The decrease in M A and Other Advisory revenue was primarily due to a lower number of M A transactions completed as compared to the 2015 period. Restructuring revenue in the 2016 period primarily reflected a higher level of activity in the U.S energy sector in the 2016 period. 
 Operating expenses decreased $40 million, or 5%, as compared to the 2015 period, primarily due to a decrease in discretionary compensation and benefits expense associated with decreased operating revenue. 
 Financial Advisory operating income was $178 million, a decrease of $13 million, or 7%, as compared to operating income of $191 million in the 2015 period and, as a percentage of net revenue, was 19.9%, as compared to 20.1% in the 2015 period. 
 Asset Management 
 The following table shows the composition of AUM for the Asset Management segment: 

Total AUM at September 30, 2016 was $205 billion, an increase of $19 billion, or 10%, as compared to total AUM of $186 billion at December 31, 2015, primarily due to market and foreign exchange appreciation and net inflows. Average AUM for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 increased 5% as compared to the three month period ended September 30, 2015, but decreased 3% for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine month period ended September 30, 2015.  
   As of September 30, 2016, approximately 88% of our AUM was managed on behalf of institutional clients, including corporations, labor unions, public pension funds, insurance companies and banks, and through sub-advisory relationships, mutual fund sponsors, broker-dealers and registered advisors, compared to approximately 89% as of December 31, 2015, and, as of September 30,  
 46 

2016, approximately 12% of our AUM was managed on behalf of individual client relationships, which are principally with family offices and individuals,   compared to approximately 11% at December 31, 2015.  
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, AUM with foreign currency exposure represented approximately 72% of our total AUM.  AUM with foreign currency exposure generally declines in value with the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar and increases in value as the U.S. Dollar weakens, with all other factors held constant. 
 The following is a summary of changes in AUM by asset class for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

(a)   
 
 Inflows in the Equity asset class were primarily attributable to the Multi-Regional, Emerging Markets and Local equity platforms, and inflows in the Fixed Income asset class were primarily attributable to the Emerging Markets and Multi-Regional platforms. Outflows in the Equity asset class were primarily attributable to the Emerging Markets, Multi-Regional and Global equity platforms, and outflows in the Fixed Income asset class were primarily attributable to the Emerging Markets and Multi-Regional platforms.    

(a)   
 
 Inflows in the Equity asset class were primarily attributable to the Multi-Regional, Emerging Markets and Global equity platforms, and inflows in the Fixed Income asset class were primarily attributable to the Emerging Markets and Multi-Regional platforms. Outflows in the Equity asset class were primarily attributable to the Emerging Markets, Multi-Regional and Global equity platforms, and outflows in the Fixed Income asset class were primarily attributable to the Emerging Markets and Multi-Regional platforms.    

47 

As of October 24, 2016, AUM was $202.6 billion, a $2.8 billion decrease since September 30, 2016. The decrease in AUM was due to foreign exchange depreciation of $2.8 billion and net outflows of $0.6 billion, partially offset by market appreciation of $0.6 billion. 
 Average AUM for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 for each significant asset class is set forth below. Average AUM generally represents the average of the monthly ending AUM balances for the period. 

The following table summarizes the reported operating results attributable to the Asset Management segment:

Asset Management Results of Operations 
 Asset Management s quarterly revenue and profits in any particular quarter or period may not be indicative of future results and may fluctuate based on the performance of the equity and other capital markets. Lazard management believes that annual results are the most meaningful basis for comparison among present, historical and future periods. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 versus September 30, 2015 
 Asset Management net revenue increased $3 million, or 1%, as compared to the 2015 period. Management fees increased $4 million, or 1%, as compared to the 2015 period, primarily due to an increase in average AUM. Incentive fees decreased $2 million, or 78%, as compared to the 2015 period, primarily due to incentive fees related to traditional investment products. Other revenue increased $1 million, or 11%, as compared to the 2015 period. 
 Operating expenses increased $7 million, or 4%, as compared to the 2015 period, primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits expense related to an increase in discretionary compensation. 
 Asset Management operating income was $82 million, a decrease of $3 million, or 4%, as compared to operating income of $85 million in the 2015 period and, as a percentage of net revenue, was 30.6%, as compared to 32.3% in the 2015 period. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 versus September 30, 2015 
 Asset Management net revenue decreased $83 million, or 10%, as compared to the 2015 period. Management fees decreased $42 million, or 6%, as compared to the 2015 period, primarily due to a decrease in average AUM primarily as a result of market depreciation and a change in the mix of AUM. Incentive fees decreased $12 million, or 78%, as compared to the 2015 period, primarily due to incentive fees related to traditional investment products and mutual funds. Other revenue decreased $29 million, or 37%, as compared to the 2015 period, principally due to a $24 million gain in 2015 on the disposal of the Company s Australian private equity business (which relates primarily to the realization of carried interest at fair value). 
 Operating expenses decreased $11 million, or 2%, as compared to the 2015 period, primarily due to decreases in (i) compensation and benefits expense and (ii) non-compensation expense related to fund administration and outsourced services. 
 Asset Management operating income was $224 million, a decrease of $71 million, or 24%, as compared to operating income of $295 million in the 2015 period and, as a percentage of net revenue, was 29.2%, as compared to 34.8% in the 2015 period. 
 Corporate

Corporate Results of Operations 
 Corporate operating results in any particular quarter or period may not be indicative of future results and may fluctuate based on a variety of factors. Lazard management believes that annual results are the most meaningful basis for comparison among present, historical and future periods. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 versus September 30, 2015 
 Net interest expense remained substantially unchanged as compared to the 2015 period. 
 Other revenue increased $20 million as compared to the 2015 period, primarily due to higher gains attributable to investments held in connection with LFI. 
 Operating expenses increased $33 million compared to the 2015 period, primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense, including an increase in charges pertaining to LFI. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 versus September 30, 2015 
 Net interest expense  decreased $4 million, or 10%, as compared to the 2015 period, primarily due to the redemption of $450 million of the 2017 Notes and the issuance of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% senior notes due 2025 (the  2025 Notes ) in the 2015 period. 
 Other revenue increased $12 million as compared to the 2015 period, primarily due to higher gains attributable to investments held in connection with LFI. 
 Operating expenses decreased $37 million as compared to the 2015 period, including, in the 2015 period, a charge of $60 million related to the redemption of a significant portion of the Company s 2017 Notes. Excluding the impact of such charge, operating expenses increased $23 million compared to the 2015 period, primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense, including an increase in charges pertaining to LFI. 
 Cash Flows 
 The Company s cash flows are influenced primarily by the timing of the receipt of Financial Advisory and Asset Management fees, the timing of distributions to members, payments of incentive compensation to managing directors and employees and purchases of Lazard Ltd Class A common stock. Cash flows also were affected in the 2015 period by the redemption of $450 million of the 2017 Notes and the issuance of the 2025 Notes. M A and Other Advisory and Asset Management fees are generally collected within 60 days of billing, while Restructuring fee collections may extend beyond 60 days, particularly those that involve bankruptcies with court-ordered holdbacks. Fees from our Private Capital Advisory (which we historically referred to as Private Fund Advisory) activities are generally collected over a four-year period from billing and typically include an interest component. 
 The Company makes cash payments for, or in respect of, a significant portion of its incentive compensation during the first three months of each calendar year with respect to the prior year s results.  
 50 

Summary of Cash Flows:  

(a)   
 
 Consists of the following:    

(b)   
 
 Includes net changes in operating assets and liabilities.    

(c)   
 
 Consists primarily of purchases of shares of Lazard Ltd Class A common stock, tax withholdings related to the settlement of vested restricted stock units ( RSUs ), vested restricted stock awards and vested PRSUs, distributions to members and noncontrolling interest holders and activity relating to borrowings, including, in 2015, the redemption of a majority of the Company s 2017 Notes and issuance of the 2025 Notes.    

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company s liquidity and capital resources are derived from operating activities, financing activities and equity offerings. 
 Operating Activities 
 Net revenue, operating income and cash receipts fluctuate significantly between periods. In the case of Financial Advisory, fee receipts are generally dependent upon the successful completion of client transactions, the occurrence and timing of which is irregular and not subject to Lazard s control. 
 Liquidity is significantly impacted by cash payments for, or in respect of, incentive compensation, a significant portion of which are made during the first three months of the year. As a consequence, cash on hand generally declines in the beginning of the year and gradually builds over the remainder of the year. We also pay certain tax advances during the year on behalf of our managing directors, which serve to reduce their respective incentive compensation payments. We expect this seasonal pattern of cash flow to continue. 
   Liquidity is also affected by the level of deposits and other customer payables, principally at LFB. To the extent that such deposits and other customer payables rise or fall, this has a corresponding impact on liquidity held at LFB, with such amounts generally being recorded in  deposits with banks and short-term investments . In the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, as  
 51 

reflected on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition, both  deposits with banks and short-term investments  and  deposits and other customer payables  increased as compared to December 31, 201  5, this being due to a higher level of LFB customer-related demand deposits, primarily from clients and funds managed by LFG.  
 Lazard s condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars. Many of Lazard s non-U.S. subsidiaries have a functional currency ( i.e ., the currency in which operational activities are primarily conducted) that is other than the U.S. Dollar, generally the currency of the country in which such subsidiaries are domiciled. Such subsidiaries  assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at the respective balance sheet date exchange rates, while revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year based on the daily closing exchange rates. Adjustments that result from translating amounts from a subsidiary s functional currency are reported as a component of members  equity. Foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on transactions in non-functional currencies are included on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 We regularly monitor our liquidity position, including cash levels, credit lines, principal investment commitments, interest and principal payments on debt, capital expenditures, distributions to members, purchases of shares of Lazard Ltd Class A common stock and matters relating to liquidity and to compliance with regulatory net capital requirements. At September 30, 2016, Lazard had approximately $833 million of cash, with such amount including approximately $431 million held at Lazard s operations outside the U.S. Since Lazard provides for U.S. income taxes on substantially all of its unrepatriated foreign earnings, we expect that no material amount of additional U.S. income taxes would be recognized upon receipt of dividends or distributions of such earnings from our foreign operations. 
 We maintain lines of credit in excess of anticipated liquidity requirements. As of September 30, 2016, Lazard had approximately $164 million in unused lines of credit available to it, including a $150 million, five-year, senior revolving credit facility with a group of lenders that expires in September 2020 (the  Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ) (see   Financing Activities  below) and unused lines of credit available to LFB of approximately $11 million (at September 30, 2016 exchange rates).  
 The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains customary terms and conditions, including limitations on consolidations, mergers, indebtedness and certain payments, as well as financial condition covenants relating to leverage and interest coverage ratios. Lazard Group s obligations under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement may be accelerated upon customary events of default, including non-payment of principal or interest, breaches of covenants, cross-defaults to other material debt, a change in control and specified bankruptcy events. 
 Financing Activities 
 The table below sets forth our corporate indebtedness as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The agreements with respect to this indebtedness are discussed in more detail in our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and in our Form 10-K. The table, as of December 31, 2015, reflects the retrospective application of new disclosure guidance on debt issuance costs. See Note 2 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

During February 2015, Lazard Group completed an offering of the 2025 Notes. Lazard Group used the net proceeds of the 2025 Notes, together with cash on hand, to redeem or otherwise retire $450 million of the 2017 Notes, which, including the recognition of unamortized issuance costs, resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment in connection with the redemption of such 2017 Notes of approximately $60 million. 
 Lazard s annual cash flow generated from operations historically has been sufficient to enable it to meet its annual obligations. We believe that our cash flows from operating activities, along with the use of our credit lines as needed, should be sufficient for us to fund our current obligations for the next 12 months. 
   As long as the lenders  commitments remain in effect, any loan pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement remains outstanding and unpaid or any other amount is due to the lending bank group, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement  
 52 

includes financial covenants that require that Lazard G  roup not permit (i) its Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) for the 12-month period ending on the last day of any fiscal quarter to be greater than 3.25 to 1.00 or (ii) its Consolidated Interest Coverage Ra  tio (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) for the 12-month period ending on the last day of any fiscal quarter to be less than 3.00 to 1.00. For the 12-month period ended September 30, 2016, Lazard Group was in compliance with such rati  os, with its Consolidated Leverage Ratio being 1.16 to 1.00 and its Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio being 20.06 to 1.00. In any event, no amounts were outstanding under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2016.  
 In addition, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, indenture and supplemental indentures relating to Lazard Group s senior notes contain certain other covenants (none of which relate to financial condition), events of default and other customary provisions. At September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all of these provisions. We may, to the extent required and subject to restrictions contained in our financing arrangements, use other financing sources, which may cause us to be subject to additional restrictions or covenants. 
 See Note 9 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding senior debt. 
 Members  Equity 
 At September 30, 2016, total members  equity was $696 million, as compared to $703 million at December 31, 2015, including $639 million and $650 million attributable to Lazard Group on the respective dates. The net activity in members  equity during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 is reflected in the table below (in millions of dollars): 

(a)   
 
 The tax withholding portion of share-based compensation is settled in cash, not shares.    

 The Board of Directors of Lazard has issued a series of authorizations to repurchase Lazard Ltd Class A common stock, which help offset the dilutive effect of our share-based incentive compensation plans. During a given year Lazard Ltd intends to repurchase at least as many shares as it expects to ultimately issue pursuant to such compensation plans in respect of year-end incentive compensation attributable to the prior year. The rate at which Lazard Ltd purchases shares in connection with this annual objective may vary from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors. Purchases with respect to such program are set forth in the table below: 

As of September 30, 2016, a total of $191 million of share repurchase authorization remained available under Lazard Ltd s share repurchase program, which will expire on December 31, 2017. 
 During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, Lazard Ltd had in place trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, pursuant to which it effected stock repurchases in the open market. 
 The Company plans to continue to deploy excess cash and may do so in a variety of ways, which may include repurchasing outstanding shares of Lazard Ltd Class A common stock, distributions to members and noncontrolling interest holders and repurchasing its outstanding debt. 
 53 

See Notes 11 and 12 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding members  equity and incentive plans, respectively.  
 Regulatory Capital 
 We actively monitor our regulatory capital base. Our principal subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements in their respective jurisdictions to ensure their general financial soundness and liquidity, which require, among other things, that we comply with certain minimum capital requirements, record-keeping, reporting procedures, relationships with customers, experience and training requirements for employees and certain other requirements and procedures. These regulatory requirements may restrict the flow of funds to and from affiliates. See Note 16 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. These regulations differ in the U.S., the U.K., France and other countries in which we operate. Our capital structure is designed to provide each of our subsidiaries with capital and liquidity consistent with its business and regulatory requirements. For a discussion of regulations relating to us, see Item 1,  Business Regulation  included in our Form 10-K. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 The following table sets forth information relating to Lazard s contractual obligations as of September 30, 2016: 

(a)   
 
 See Note 9 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.    

(b)   
 
 Unfunded commitments to private equity investments consolidated but not owned by Lazard of $6,724 are excluded. Such commitments are required to be funded by capital contributions from noncontrolling interest holders. See Note 5 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These amounts are generally due on demand and therefore are presented in the  less than 1 year  category.    

(c)   
 
 The table above excludes contingent obligations, as well as any possible payments for uncertain tax positions given the inability to estimate the possible amounts and timing of any such payments.  See Notes 10, 12, 13 and 14 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements regarding information in connection with commitments, incentive plans, employee benefit plans and income taxes, respectively.    

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Management s discussion and analysis of our condensed consolidated financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of Lazard s condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, Lazard evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, income taxes, investing activities and goodwill. Lazard bases these estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments, including judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities, that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 Lazard believes that the critical accounting policies set forth below comprise the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 54 

Revenue Recognition  
 Lazard generates substantially all of its net revenue from providing Financial Advisory and Asset Management services to clients. Lazard recognizes revenue when the following criteria are met: 

there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a client;     

the agreed-upon services have been provided;     

fees are fixed or determinable; and     

collection is probable.     

 The Company earns performance-based incentive fees on various investment products, including traditional products and alternative investment funds such as hedge funds and private equity funds. See  Financial Statement Overview  for a description of our revenue recognition policies on such fees. 
 If, in Lazard s judgment, collection of a fee is not probable, Lazard will not recognize revenue until the uncertainty is removed. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide coverage for estimated losses from our receivables. We determine the adequacy of the allowance by estimating the probability of loss based on our analysis of the client s creditworthiness and specifically reserve against exposures where we determine the receivables are impaired, which may include situations where a fee is in dispute or litigation has commenced. 
 With respect to fees receivable from Financial Advisory activities, such receivables are generally deemed past due when they are outstanding 60 days from the date of invoice. However, some Financial Advisory transactions include specific contractual payment terms that may vary from one month to four years (as is the case for our Private Capital Advisory fees) following the invoice date or may be subject to court approval (as is the case with restructuring assignments that include bankruptcy proceedings). In such cases, receivables are deemed past due when payment is not received by the agreed-upon contractual date or the court approval date, respectively. Financial Advisory fee receivables past due in excess of 180 days are fully provided for unless there is evidence that the balance is collectible. Asset Management fees are deemed past due and fully provided for when such receivables are outstanding 12 months after the invoice date. Notwithstanding our policy for receivables past due, we specifically reserve against exposures relating to Financial Advisory and Asset Management fees where we determine receivables are impaired. 
 Compensation Liabilities 
 Annual discretionary compensation represents a significant portion of our annual compensation and benefits expense. We allocate the estimated amount of such annual discretionary compensation to interim periods in proportion to the amount of operating revenue earned in such periods based on an assumed annual ratio of awarded compensation and benefits expense to operating revenue. See  Financial Statement Overview Operating Expenses  for more information on our periodic compensation and benefits expense. 
 Income Taxes 
 As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income taxes for each of our tax-paying entities in its respective jurisdictions. In addition to estimating actual current tax liabilities for these jurisdictions, we also must account for the tax effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting of items, such as basis adjustments, compensation and benefits expense, and depreciation and amortization. Differences which are temporary in nature result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets and our unrecognized tax benefits. 
 We recognize a deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of greater than 50%) that a tax benefit will be accepted by a taxing authority. The measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based upon currently enacted tax rates in the applicable jurisdictions. At December 31, 2015, on a consolidated basis, we recorded gross deferred tax assets of approximately $170 million, with such amount partially offset by a valuation allowance of approximately $89 million (as described below). 
 Subsequent to the initial recognition of deferred tax assets, we also must continually assess the likelihood that such deferred tax assets will be realized. If we determine that we may not fully derive the benefit from a deferred tax asset, we consider whether it would be appropriate to apply a valuation allowance against the applicable deferred tax asset, taking into account all available information. The ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset for a particular entity depends, among other things, on the generation of taxable income by such entity in the applicable jurisdiction. 
 55 

We consider multiple possible sources of taxable income when assessing   a valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset, including:  

future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences;     

future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards;     

taxable income in prior carryback years; and     

tax-planning strategies.     

 The assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted also considers all available information, including the following: 

nature, frequency, magnitude and duration of any past losses and current operating results;     

duration of statutory carryforward periods;     

historical experience with tax attributes expiring unused; and     

near-term and medium-term financial outlook.     

 The weight we give to any particular item is, in part, dependent upon the degree to which it can be objectively verified. We give greater weight to the recent results of operations of a relevant entity. Pre-tax operating losses on a three year cumulative basis or lack of sustainable profitability are considered objectively verifiable evidence and will generally outweigh a projection of future taxable income. 
 Certain of our tax-paying entities have individually experienced losses on a cumulative three year basis or have not yet attained a sustained level of profitability. In addition, one of our tax paying entities has recorded a valuation allowance on all of its deferred tax assets due to the combined effect of operating losses in certain subsidiaries of that entity as well as foreign taxes that together substantially offset any U.S. tax liability. Taking into account all available information, we cannot determine that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets held by these entities will be realized. Consequently, we have recorded valuation allowances on $89 million of deferred tax assets held by these entities as of December 31, 2015. 
 We record tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return based upon our estimates regarding the amount that is more likely than not to be realized or paid, including in connection with the resolution of any related appeals or other legal processes. Accordingly, we recognize liabilities for certain unrecognized tax benefits based on the amounts that are more likely than not to be settled with the relevant taxing authority. Such liabilities are evaluated periodically as new information becomes available and any changes in the amounts of such liabilities are recorded as adjustments to  income tax expense.  Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits involve significant judgment and the ultimate resolution of such matters may be materially different from our estimates. 
 In addition to the discussion above regarding deferred tax assets and associated valuation allowances, as well as unrecognized tax benefit liability estimates, other factors affect our provision for income taxes, including changes in the geographic mix of our business, the level of our annual pre-tax income, transfer pricing and intercompany transactions. 
 See Item 1A,  Risk Factors  in our Form 10-K and Note 14 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to income taxes. 
 Investments 
 Investments consist primarily of interest-bearing deposits, debt and equity securities, interests in alternative investment, debt, equity and private equity funds and investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting. 
 These investments, with the exception of interest-bearing deposits and equity method investments, are carried at fair value on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition, and any increases or decreases in the fair value of these investments are reflected in earnings. The fair value of investments is generally based upon market prices or the net asset value ( NAV ) or its equivalent for investments in funds. See Note 5 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the measurement of the fair value of investments. 
 Lazard is subject to market and credit risk on investments held. As such, gains and losses on investment positions held, which arise from sales or changes in the fair value of the investments, are not predictable and can cause periodic fluctuations in net income. 
 56 

Data relating to investments is set forth below:  

(b)   
 
 Private equity investments include investments related to certain legacy businesses and co-investments in private equity funds managed by our Asset Management business. Co-investments owned were $34 million and $30 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.    

(c)   
 
 Short to medium term interest rates generally turned negative in Europe during 2014 and remain very low in many other countries and regions throughout the world. In the normal course of asset and liability management activities, the Company attempts to minimize negative interest rates on its cash investments. Interest-bearing deposits generally provide positive yields when held to maturity, while also generally allowing immediate penalty-free withdrawal at any time (with less or no interest earned in such case).    

(d)   
 
 Represents investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting.    

(e)   
 
 Represents private equity investments that are consolidated but owned by noncontrolling interests, and therefore do not subject the Company to market or credit risk. The applicable noncontrolling interests are presented within  members  equity  on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.    

(f)   
 
 Composed of investments held in connection with LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements. The market risk associated with such investments is equally offset by the market risk associated with the derivative liability with respect to awards expected to vest. The Company is subject to market risk associated with any portion of such investments that employees may forfeit. See   Risk Management Risks Related to Derivatives  for risk management information relating to derivatives.    

   At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, total investments with a fair value of $455 million and $467 million, respectively, included $1 million at each such date, or less than 1%, respectively, of investments that were classified as Level 3 investments and $140 million and $123 million, respectively, or 31% and 26%, respectively, of investments that were classified using NAV or its equivalent as a practical expedient. See Notes 4 and 5 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for  
 57 

additional information regarding investments measured at fair value, including the levels of fair value within which such measurements of fair value fall.  
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company held seed investments of approximately $124 million and $146 million, respectively. Seed investments held in entities in which the Company maintained a controlling interest were $36 million in nine entities as of September 30, 2016, as compared to $49 million in eleven entities as of December 31, 2015. 
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not consolidate or deconsolidate any seed investment entities. As such, 100% of the recorded balance of seed investments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 represented the Company s economic interest in the seed investments. See   Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities  below for more information on the Company s policy regarding the consolidation of seed investment entities. 
 For additional information regarding risks associated with our investments, see  Risk Management Investments  below as well as Item 1A,  Risk Factors Other Business Risks Our results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the fair value of positions held in our investment portfolios  in our Form 10-K. 
 Assets Under Management 
 AUM primarily consists of debt and equity instruments, which have a value that is readily available based on either prices quoted on a recognized exchange or prices provided by external pricing services. 
 Prices of equity and debt securities and other instruments that comprise our AUM are provided by well-recognized, independent, third-party vendors. Such third-party vendors rely on prices provided by external pricing services which are obtained from recognized exchanges or markets, or, for certain fixed income securities, from an evaluated bid or other similarly sourced price. 
 Either directly, or through our third-party vendors, we perform a variety of regular due diligence procedures on our pricing service providers. Those procedures include oversight by our internal operations group, review of the pricing service providers  internal control frameworks, review of the pricing service providers  valuation methodologies, reconciliation to client custodial account values and comparison of significant pricing differences. 
 Goodwill 
 In accordance with current accounting guidance, goodwill has an indefinite life and is tested for impairment annually, as of November 1, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The Company performs a qualitative evaluation about whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount in lieu of actually calculating the fair value of the reporting unit. See Note 8 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding goodwill. 
 Consolidation 
 The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Lazard Group and entities in which it has a controlling interest. Lazard determines whether it has a controlling interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity ( VOE ) or a variable interest entity ( VIE ) under U.S. GAAP. 

Voting Interest Entities. VOEs are entities in which (i) the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance itself independently and (ii) the equity holders have the obligation to absorb losses, the right to receive residual returns and the right to make decisions about the entity s activities. Lazard is required to consolidate a VOE if it holds a majority of the voting interest in such VOE.     

Variable Interest Entities. VIEs are entities that lack one or more of the characteristics of a VOE. If Lazard has a variable interest, or a combination of variable interests, in a VIE, it is required to analyze whether it needs to consolidate such VIE. Lazard is required to consolidate a VIE if we are the primary beneficiary having (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of, or receive benefits from, the VIE that could be potentially significant to the VIE.     

 58 

Lazard s involvement with various entiti  es that are VOEs or VIEs primarily arises from investment management contracts with fund entities in our Asset Management business. Lazard is not required to consolidate such entities because, with the exception of certain seed investments, as discussed be  low, we do not hold more than an inconsequential equity interest in such entities and we do not hold other variable interests (including our investment management agreements, which do not meet the definition of variable interests) in such entities.  
 Lazard makes seed investments in certain entities that are considered VOEs and often require consolidation as a result of our investment. The impact of seed investment entities that require consolidation on the condensed consolidated financial statements, including any consolidation or deconsolidation of such entities, is not material to our financial statements. Our exposure to loss from entities in which we have made seed investments is limited to the extent of our investment in, or investment commitment to, such entities. See  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Investments  above for more information regarding our investments. 
 Generally, when the Company initially invests to seed an investment entity, the Company is the majority owner of the entity. Our majority ownership in seed investment entities represents a controlling interest, except when we are the general partner in such entities and the third-party investors have the right to replace the general partner. To the extent material, we consolidate seed investment entities in which we own a controlling interest, and we would deconsolidate any such entity when we no longer have a controlling interest in such entity. 
 Risk Management 
 Investments 
 The Company has investments in a variety of asset classes, primarily debt and equity securities, and interests in alternative investments, debt, equity and private equity funds. The Company makes investments primarily to seed strategies in our Asset Management business or to reduce exposure arising from LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements. The Company measures its net economic exposure to market and other risks arising from investments that it owns, excluding (i) investments held in connection with LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements, (ii) investments in funds owned entirely by the noncontrolling interest holders of certain acquired entities and (iii) interest-bearing deposits over 90 days that allow daily withdrawals without principal penalties. 
 Risk sensitivities include the effects of economic hedging. For equity market price risk, investment portfolios and their corresponding hedges are beta-adjusted to the All-Country World equity index. Fair value and sensitivity measurements presented herein are based on various portfolio exposures at a particular point in time and may not be representative of future results. Risk exposures may change as a result of ongoing portfolio activities and changing market conditions, among other things. 
 Equity Market Price Risk At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s exposure to equity market price risk in its investment portfolio, which primarily relates to investments in equity securities, equity funds and hedge funds, was approximately $100 million and $129 million, respectively. The Company hedges market exposure arising from a significant portion of our equity investment portfolios by entering into total return swaps. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a net decrease of approximately $1.1 million and $1.8 million in the carrying value of such investments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, including the effect of the hedging transactions. 
 Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s exposure to interest rate and credit spread risk in its investment portfolio related to investments in debt securities or funds which invest primarily in debt securities was $50 million and $38 million, respectively. The Company hedges market exposure arising from a portion of our debt investment portfolios by entering into total return swaps. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse change in interest rates or credit spreads would result in a decrease of approximately $0.8 million and $0.1 million in the carrying value of such investments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, including the effect of the hedging transactions. 
 Foreign Exchange Rate Risk At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk in its investment portfolio, which primarily relates to investments in foreign currency denominated equity and debt securities, was $57 million and $64 million, respectively. A significant portion of the Company s foreign currency exposure related to our equity and debt investment portfolios is hedged through the aforementioned total return swaps. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar would result in a decrease of approximately $1.5 million and $1.0 million in the carrying value of such investments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, including the effect of the hedging transactions. 
   Private Equity The Company invests in private equity primarily as a part of its co-investment activities and in connection with certain legacy businesses. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s exposure to changes in fair value of such  
 59 

investments wa  s approximately $110 million and $84 million, respectively. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 10% adverse change in fair value would result in a decrease of approximately $11.0 million and $8.4 million in the carrying value of such investments as o  f September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
 Risks Related to Receivables 
 We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide coverage for probable losses from our receivables. We determine the adequacy of the allowance by estimating the probability of loss based on our analysis of the client s creditworthiness, among other things, and specifically provide for exposures where we determine the receivables are impaired. At September 30, 2016, total receivables amounted to $564 million, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $13 million. As of that date, Financial Advisory and Asset Management fees, receivables from Lazard Ltd subsidiaries, and customers and other receivables comprised 78%, 5% and 17% of total receivables, respectively. At December 31, 2015, total receivables amounted to $606 million, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $13 million. As of that date, Financial Advisory and Asset Management fees, receivables from Lazard Ltd subsidiaries, and customers and other receivables comprised 70%, 18% and 12% of total receivables, respectively. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had receivables past due or deemed uncollectible of approximately $22 million and $20 million, respectively. See also  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Revenue Recognition  above and Note 3 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding receivables. 
 LFB engages in lending activities, including commitments to extend credit (primarily for clients of LFG). At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, customer receivables included $49 million and $38 million of LFB loans, respectively, with such loans being fully collateralized and closely monitored for counterparty creditworthiness. 
 Credit Concentrations 
 To reduce the exposure to concentrations of credit, the Company monitors large exposures to individual counterparties. 
 Risks Related to Derivatives 
 Lazard enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge exposures to currency exchange rates and interest rates and uses total return swap contracts on various equity and debt indices to hedge a portion of its market exposure with respect to certain seed investments related to our Asset Management business. Derivative contracts are recorded at fair value. Derivative assets amounted to $2 million and $1 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and derivative liabilities, excluding the derivative liability arising from the Company s obligation pertaining to LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements, amounted to $11 million and $2 million at such respective dates. 
 The Company also records derivative liabilities relating to its obligations pertaining to LFI awards and other similar deferred compensation arrangements, the fair value of which is based on the value of the underlying investments, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. Changes in the fair value of the derivative liabilities are equally offset by the changes in the fair value of investments which are expected to be delivered upon settlement of LFI awards. Derivative liabilities relating to LFI amounted to $175 million and $194 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
 Risks Related to Cash and Cash Equivalents and Corporate Indebtedness 
 A significant portion of the Company s indebtedness has fixed interest rates, while its cash and cash equivalents generally have market interest rates. Based on account balances as of September 30, 2016, Lazard estimates that its annual operating income relating to cash and cash equivalents would increase by approximately $8 million in the event interest rates were to increase by 1% and decrease by approximately $8 million if rates were to decrease by 1%. 
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company s cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $833 million. Substantially all of the Company s cash and cash equivalents were invested in (i) highly liquid institutional money market funds (a significant majority of which were invested solely in U.S. Government or agency money market funds), (ii) in short-term interest bearing and non-interest bearing accounts at a number of leading banks throughout the world, and (iii) in short-term certificates of deposit from such banks. Cash and cash equivalents are constantly monitored. On a regular basis, management reviews its investment profile as well as the credit profile of its list of depositor banks in order to adjust any deposit or investment thresholds as necessary. 
 Operational Risk 
   Operational risk is inherent in all our business and may, for example, manifest itself in the form of errors, breaches in the system of internal controls, employee misconduct, business interruptions, fraud, including fraud perpetrated by third parties, or legal actions  
 60 

due to operating deficiencies or noncompliance. The Company maintains a framework including policies and a system of internal controls designed to monitor and manage operational risk and provide management with timely and   accurate information. Management within each of the operating companies is primarily responsible for its operational risk programs. The Company has in place business continuity and disaster recovery programs that manage its capabilities to provide services   in the case of a disruption. We purchase insurance policies designed to help protect the Company against accidental loss and losses that may significantly affect our financial objectives, personnel, property or our ability to continue to meet our responsi  bilities to our various stakeholder groups.

 Risk Management 
 Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are included under the caption  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management . 

Item  4.   
 
     Controls and Procedures    

 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 In addition, no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

61 

PART II. OTHER   INFORMATION  

Item 1.   
 
     Legal Proceedings    

 The Company is involved from time to time in judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings and inquiries concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of our businesses, including proceedings initiated by former employees alleging wrongful termination. The Company reviews such matters on a case-by-case basis and establishes any required accrual if a loss is probable and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company experiences significant variation in its revenue and earnings on a quarterly basis. Accordingly, the results of any pending matter or matters could be significant when compared to the Company s earnings in any particular fiscal quarter. The Company believes, however, based on currently available information, that the results of any pending matters, in the aggregate, will not have a material effect on its business or financial condition.

EXHIBIT 12.1  
 LAZARD GROUP LLC  
 COMPUTATION OF RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES (a) 
 The following table sets forth the ratio of earnings to fixed charges for Lazard Group LLC and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.  

Notes (dollars in thousands):  

(a)   
 
 For purposes of computing the ratio of earnings to fixed charges:     

earnings for the periods presented represent income before income taxes and fixed charges, and      

fixed charges represent the interest expense and the portion of rental expense which represents an appropriate interest factor.      

(b)   
 
 The Company s policy is to include interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Accordingly, such interest expense is not included in the computations of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges.     

(c)   
 
 Other fixed charges consist of the interest factor in rentals.     

(d)   
 
 Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 is presented after giving effect to a charge of (i) $60,219 associated with the redemption of $450 million of the 2017 Notes, (ii) $2,655 excess interest expense due to the period of time between the issuance of the 2025 Notes and the settlement of the redemption of the 2017 Notes and (iii) $12,203 relating to a private equity revenue adjustment. Excluding the impact of such items, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges would have been 8.64.     

(e)   
 
 Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2013 is presented after giving effect to a charge of (i) $64,703 associated with the cost saving initiatives announced by the Company in October 2012, (ii) $54,087 pertaining to the refinancing of the 2015 Notes and the issuance of the 2020 Notes and (iii) $12,203 relating to private equity incentive compensation. Excluding the impact of such charges, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges would have been 4.14.     

(f)   
 
 Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2012 is presented after giving effect to (i) a charge in the first quarter of $24,659 relating to severance costs and benefit payments associated with staff reductions, including the acceleration of unrecognized amortization expense of deferred incentive compensation previously granted to individuals being terminated, and (ii) a charge in the fourth quarter of $102,576 associated with the cost saving initiatives announced by the Company in October 2012. Excluding the impact of such items, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges would have been 3.14.
