CAUTIONARY
STATEMENT ON FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION   

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this  Report ) contains  forward-looking statements  within the meaning
of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities
Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). Forward-looking
statements discuss matters that are not historical facts. Because they discuss future events or conditions, forward-looking statements
may include words such as  anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   intend,   could, 
 should,   would,   may,   seek,   plan,   might,   will, 
 expect,   predict,   project,   forecast,   potential,   continue 
negatives thereof or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, are based on various
underlying assumptions and current expectations about the future and are not guarantees. Such statements involve known and unknown
risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievement to be
materially different from the results of operations or plans expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  

We
cannot predict all of the risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, such information should not be regarded as representations that
the results or conditions described in such statements or that our objectives and plans will be achieved and we do not assume
any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any of these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements
are found at various places throughout this Report and include information concerning possible or assumed future results of our
operations, including statements about potential acquisition or merger targets; business strategies; future cash flows; financing
plans; plans and objectives of management; any other statements regarding future acquisitions, future cash needs, future operations,
business plans and future financial results, and any other statements that are not historical facts.  

These
forward-looking statements represent our intentions, plans, expectations, assumptions and beliefs about future events and are
subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors. Many of those factors are outside of our control and could cause actual results
to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements. In light of these risks, uncertainties
and assumptions, the events described in the forward-looking statements might not occur or might occur to a different extent or
at a different time than we have described. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements,
which speak only as of the date of this Report. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning other matters
addressed in this Report and attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by
the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this Report.  

Except
to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result
of new information, future events, a change in events, conditions, circumstances or assumptions underlying such statements, or
otherwise.

1 - Organization and Operations   

Vapir
Enterprises, Inc.    

Vapir
Enterprises Inc. (formerly FAL Exploration Corp.) ( Vapir Enterprises  or the  Company ) was incorporated
in the State of Nevada on December 17, 2009. The Company s principal business is focused on inventing, developing and producing
aromatherapy devices and vaporizers. The Company s aromatherapy devices utilize heat and convection air and thereby extract
natural essences and produce fresh fragrances. Vapir, Inc. ( Vapir ) is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and
was incorporated in the State of California in October 2006.   

Note
2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Basis
of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation    

The
accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission for interim financial information, which includes condensed consolidated financial statements and present the consolidated
financial statements of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary as of September 30, 2016. All intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated. Accordingly, the condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the information
and notes necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position and results of operations and should be read in conjunction
with the Annual Report, Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  It is management's opinion that all material
adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) have been made, which are necessary for a fair financial statement presentation.
Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The results for the interim period are
not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Use
of estimates   

In
preparing the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet, and revenues and
expenses for the period then ended. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates. Significant estimates made by
management include, but are not limited to allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory obsolescence and markdowns, the useful life
of property and equipment, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, valuation of intangible assets, the assumptions
used to calculate fair value of stock options and warrants granted, stock-based compensation and the fair value of common stock
issued.   

Cash
equivalents    

The
Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments and other short-term investments with maturities of three months or less,
when purchased, to be cash equivalents.  The Company maintains cash and cash equivalent balances at one financial institution
that is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company s account at this institution is insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) up to $250,000. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has not reached
bank balances exceeding the FDIC insurance limit. To reduce its risk associated with the failure of such financial institution,
the Company evaluates at least annually the rating of the financial institution in which it holds deposits.  

Accounts
receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts    

The
Company has a policy of providing on allowance for doubtful accounts based on its best estimate of the amount of probable credit
losses in its existing accounts receivable.  The Company periodically reviews its accounts receivable to determine whether
an allowance is necessary based on an analysis of past due accounts and other factors that may indicate that the realization of
an account may be in doubt.  Account balances deemed to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense and included
in the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company recorded $2,009 and $1,373 in the allowance for doubtful accounts, respectively.
The Company recorded bad debt expense of $1,619 and $0 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Note
2 - Significant and Critical Accounting Policies and Practices (continued)     

Inventory    

Inventory
Valuation   

The
Company values inventory, consisting of finished goods, at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the first-in and
first-out ( FIFO ) method. The Company reduces inventory for the diminution of value, resulting from product obsolescence,
damage or other issues affecting marketability, equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market
value. Factors utilized in the determination of estimated market value include (i) estimates of future demand, and (ii) competitive
pricing pressures. At September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded a reserve for slow-moving inventory of $23,162 and $0,
respectively.  

Inventory
Obsolescence and Markdowns   

The
Company evaluates its current level of inventory considering historical sales and other factors and, based on this evaluation,
classifies inventory markdowns in the income statement as a component of cost of goods sold pursuant to Paragraph 420-10-S99 of
the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to adjust inventory to net realizable value. These markdowns are estimates, which could
vary significantly from actual requirements if future economic conditions, customer demand or competition differ from expectations.  

There
was no inventory obsolescence for the reporting period ended September 30, 2016 or 2015. There was no lower of cost or market
adjustments for the reporting period ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.  

Advances
to suppliers    

Advances
to a supplier represents the cash paid in advance which is usually in three installment payments for the purchase of inventory.
The advances to a supplier are interest free and unsecured. As of September 30, 2016, advance to the Company s major supplier
amounted $107,565. Upon shipment of the purchase inventory, the Company reclass or records such advances to supplier into inventory.  

Property
and Equipment    

Property
and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.  Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements
and improvements are capitalized.  When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are
removed, and any resulting gains or losses are included in the consolidated statement of operations.  

Revenue
recognition    

The
Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company will
recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned
when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped
or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is
reasonably assured.  

Consideration
paid to promote and sell the Company s products to customers is typically recorded as marketing costs incurred by the Company.
If the amount of consideration paid to customers exceeds the marketing costs, any excess is recorded as a reduction of revenue.
The Company follows the requirements of FASB ASC 605-50-45-2, Revenue Recognition Customer Payments and Incentives.  

Cost
of Sales    

The
primary components of cost of sales include the cost of the product and shipping fees.  

Shipping
and Handling Costs    

The
Company accounts for shipping and handling fees in accordance with paragraph 605-45-45-19 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.
While amounts charged to customers for shipping products are included in revenues, the related costs are classified in cost of
goods sold as incurred. Shipping costs included in cost of goods sold were $89,074 and $79,638 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Advertising
Costs    

The
Company follows the guidance of the Section 720-35-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( Section 720-35-25 )
as to when advertising costs should be expensed. Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 720-35-25-1 the Company expenses the advertising costs
when the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising costs were $9,876 and $24,021 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

The
amounts paid to customers for marketing expenses incurred in behalf of the Company are recorded as marketing cost and not as a
reduction of revenue in accordance with FASB ASC 605-50-45-2, Revenue Recognition Customer Payments and Incentives. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a total of marketing cost of approximately $71,500 as consideration
paid to promote and sell the Company s products to customers.  

Income
Taxes    

The
Company discloses tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions pursuant to the ASC Paragraph 740-10-50-15.
The federal and state income tax returns of the Company are subject to examination by the IRS and state taxing authorities, generally
for three years after they are filed. The Company's 2015, 2014 and 2013 tax years are still subject to federal and state tax examination.  

Earnings
per Share    

Earnings
per share ( EPS ) is the amount of earnings attributable to each share of common stock. For convenience, the term is
used to refer to either earnings or loss per share. EPS is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification. Pursuant to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-10 through 260-10-45-16 Basic EPS shall be computed by dividing income available
to common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the
period. Income available to common stockholders shall be computed by deducting both the dividends declared in the period on preferred
stock (whether or not paid) and the dividends accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned)
from income from continuing operations (if that amount appears in the income statement) and also from net income. The computation
of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional
common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued during the period to reflect
the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement, stock options
or warrants.  

Pursuant
to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-45-21 through 260-10-45-45-23 Diluted EPS shall be based on the most advantageous conversion rate
or exercise price from the standpoint of the security holder. The dilutive effect of outstanding call options and warrants (and
their equivalents) issued by the reporting entity shall be reflected in diluted EPS by application of the treasury stock method
unless the provisions of paragraphs 260-10-45-35 through 45-36 and 260-10-55-8 through 55-11 require that another method be applied.
Equivalents of options and warrants include non-vested stock granted to employees, stock purchase contracts, and partially paid
stock subscriptions (see paragraph 260-10-55-23). Anti-dilutive contracts, such as purchased put options and purchased call options,
shall be excluded from diluted EPS. Under the treasury stock method: a. Exercise of options and warrants shall be assumed at the
beginning of the period (or at time of issuance, if later) and common shares shall be assumed to be issued. b. The proceeds from
exercise shall be assumed to be used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. (See paragraphs 260-10-45-29
and 260-10-55-4 through 55-5.) c. The incremental shares (the difference between the number of shares assumed issued and the number
of shares assumed purchased) shall be included in the denominator of the diluted EPS computation. Pursuant to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-40
through 45-42 convertible securities shall be reflected in diluted EPS by application of if converted method. The convertible
preferred stock or convertible debt shall be assumed to have been converted at the beginning of the period (or at time of issuance,
if later). In applying the if-converted method, conversion shall not be assumed for purposes of computing diluted EPS if the effect
would be anti-dilutive. The Company s contingent shares issuance arrangement, stock options or warrants are as follows:    

There
were no incremental common shares under the Treasury Stock Method for the reporting period ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements    

In
February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying
leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase
by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or
on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability
for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less
will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases. The new guidance will be effective for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period and is applied retrospectively.
Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently in the process of assessing the impact the adoption of this guidance will
have on the Company s consolidated financial statements. Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet
effective accounting pronouncements, when adopted, will have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.  

Note
3 - Going Concern   

The
Company has elected to adopt early application of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements-Going
Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU
2014-15 ). The Company s condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that it will continue
as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the
normal course of business. As reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit
of approximately $1.97 million at September 30, 2016, a net loss of approximately $1.5 million and net cash used in operating
activities of approximately $397,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

The
Company is attempting to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue; however, the Company s cash
position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a private
or public offering. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to further implement its business plan and generate
sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the

Note
8 - Convertible Notes Payable   

On
April 3, 2015, the Company closed a financing transaction by entering into a Securities Purchase Agreement dated April 3, 2015
(the  Securities Purchase Agreement ) with certain accredited investors (the  Purchasers ) for an aggregate
subscription amount of $500,000 (the  Purchase Price ). Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company
issued a 6% Convertible Debenture (the  Debenture ) and warrants to acquire 500,000 shares of the Company's common
stock at an exercise price of $0.60 per share (the  Warrants ).  

The
total principal amount of the Debentures is $500,000. The Debenture accrues interest at 6% per annum and the Debenture matured
on October 3, 2016 and is convertible any time after its issuance date. The Purchaser has the right to convert the Debenture into
shares of the Company s common stock at $0.50 per share. The conversion price, however, is subject to full ratchet anti-dilution
in the event that the Company issues any securities at a per share price lower than the conversion price then in effect. The Company
paid financing costs of $22,500 in connection with this Debenture, which was initially recorded as prepaid financing cost and
is being amortized over the term of the Debenture.  

The
Warrants issued in this transaction are immediately exercisable at an exercise price of $0.60 per share, subject to applicable
adjustments, including full ratchet anti-dilution in the event that the Company issues any securities at a per share price lower
than the exercise price then in effect. The Warrants have an expiration period of five years from the date of the original issuance.  

The
Company is currently in negotiations with the note holders to convert these notes payable into common stock. The Company has not
received any default notice from the note holders.  

Convertible
notes payable consisted of the following:

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company recognized $248,634 and $163,935, respectively of amortization of
debt discount. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company recognized $11,189 and $7,377, respectively of
amortization of deferred financing cost. The amortization of debt discount and deferred financing cost were included in interest
expense. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, accrued interest related to this Debenture amounted to $44,977 and $22,456,
respectively.  

Note
9 - Derivative Liabilities   

Since
the terms of the Debentures and Warrants in the April 2015 closing include a down-round provision under which the conversion price
and exercise price could be affected by future equity offerings undertaken by the Company under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic
No. 815-40,  Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in an Entity s Own Stock , the embedded conversion feature
and the warrants were accounted for as derivative liabilities at the date of issuance and adjusted to fair value through earnings
at each reporting date. In accordance with ASC 815, the Company has bifurcated the conversion feature of the convertible Debentures,
along with the free-standing warrant derivative instruments and recorded derivative liabilities on their issuance date. The Company
uses the Simple Binomial Lattice model to value the derivative liabilities. The Debentures were all discounted in full based on
the valuations and the Company recognized an additional derivative expense of $188,378 upon initial recording of the derivative
liabilities. The total debt discount of $500,000 consisted of initial valuation of the derivatives of $250,407 and the valuation
of the warrants of $249,593 to be amortized over the terms of the note. These derivative liabilities are then revalued on each
reporting date. The gain resulting from the decrease in fair value of these convertible instruments was $75,670 and $456,083 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a warrant derivative
liability of $78,270 and note derivative liability of $48,713.

views future sales level with a fair degree of uncertainty in that management has not been able to identify whether our sales
level are trending up or down over the near term. As a result, we believed our sales level are subject to high level of uncertainty.

Operating
Expenses    

Total
operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $389,434 and $368,032, respectively, an increase
of $21,402 or approximately 6%. The increase in operating expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily
due to an increase in stock based consulting of approximately $19,000 and an increase in stock based compensation of $107,000
in connection with common stock and stock options granted to our CEO, Directors, employees and consultants of the Company during
the three months ended September 30, 2016. Such increases were offset by a decrease in cash compensation to our employees of approximately
$58,000, a decrease in legal and accounting fee of approximately $31,000 and a decrease in health insurance expense of approximately
$13,000.  

Total
operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $1,555,226 and $1,103,593, respectively, an increase
of $451,633 or approximately 41%. The increase in operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily

The
Company s management continues to evaluate its operating cost with an aim of reducing its operating expenses in the future.

Total
other (expense) income, net, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $(146,047) and $58,622. The increase
in other expense is the primary result of the decrease in derivative expense and decreased gain resulting from the decrease in
fair value of derivative liabilities during the three month period.  

Total
other expense, net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $(245,712) and $58,267, respectively, an increase
of $187,445. The increase in other expense is the primary result of the decreased gain resulting from the decrease in fair value
of derivative liabilities offset by interest expense from related party advances and convertible debentures and also includes
amortization of debt discount and deferred financing cost of approximately $260,000 in connection with the issuance of convertible
debentures.  

Net
loss    

Our
net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $442,722 and $190,850, respectively, as a result of the items
discussed above. Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1,459,200 and $551,851, respectively, as
a result of the items discussed above.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Liquidity
is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise
operate on an ongoing basis. As of September 30, 2016, our total current liabilities exceeded our total current assets and, as
a result, we had a working capital deficit and a further deterioration in our liquidity over the past 12 months.  

We
are not aware of any known any known demands, commitments or events that will result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing
in any material way. We are not aware of any matters that would have a positive impact on future operations. But over the past
twelve months we have had increasing losses that is likely to continue if current market conditions continue.  

Our
net revenues are not sufficient to fund our operating expenses. At September 30, 2016, we had a cash balance of approximately
$9,500 and working capital deficit of $1,588,000. Our cash increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 by approximately
$1,700 from our cash balance at December 31, 2015 of $7,900. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we borrowed $50,000
by issuing a note payable which will mature in February 2019 and we also received related party advances for a total of $400,000
to fund our operating expenses, pay our obligations, and grow our company. We currently have no material commitments for capital
expenditures.  

We
are facing increasing demands that will likely require that we raise additional funds. If circumstances and market conditions
allow, we may be able to raise additional capital but it may be under market conditions that are not favorable with the result
that we may incur dilution or be required to accept debt covenants or other conditions that are onerous or which otherwise limit
our ability to gain or attract additional financing in the future. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be successful
in raising any additional funds or if we are successful, that we will be able to do so on terms that are reasonable in light of
our current circumstances. As a small company with a limited product line and limited customer base, we face continuing risks
and uncertainties that serve to make our company and an investment in our common stock subject to risks that are beyond our control.
We estimate that based on current plans and assumptions, that our cash is not sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements under
our present operating expectations, without further financing, for the next 12 months.  

Our
ability to generate and maintain a positive cash flow from our operations cannot be assured. Based solely on our own internal
estimates without the benefit of any independent third party evaluation, we anticipate that our cash and cash flow will not be
sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements and we will likely require significant additional external financing. The magnitude
of the additional financing and its timing is not yet precisely known and depending on the level of our sales revenues and other
operating needs we may be facing a prolonged multi-period scenario of negative cash flows with increasing losses. As a result,
we face increasing risks and persons who acquire our common stock may incur the loss of all or substantially all of their investment.  

Currently,
we have no other known alternative source for any additional financing except those sources which we have previously used and
we cannot be assured that our prior sources will have any willingness to provide us with additional capital or, if they do, that
the terms of any such additional financing will be reasonable in light of our current conditions. Further, we cannot assure you
that we can continue to rely upon those existing financing sources in the future. We may not have sufficient working capital and
funds from the collection of revenues that may allow us to maintain or expand our existing operations, to provide sufficient working
capital to meet our operating needs and our outstanding financial obligations. For this reason we anticipate that, based on current
market conditions and our existing financial condition, we will likely need to obtain significant additional capital. In this
sense we currently anticipate that we will remain dependent on our ability to secure additional financing.  

In
the event that we are able to secure a sufficient amount additional financing on a timely basis, it may include the issuance of
equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or entering into other financing arrangements on such terms as then existing
market conditions require. The capital market for small or micro-cap companies has been and likely will remain very difficult
in the near future. As a result our ability to obtain additional capital on terms that are reasonable in light of current market
conditions cannot be assured. We may be forced to obtain additional capital on terms that could limit our long term ability to
remain in business or otherwise materially restrict our operations. Further, our current financial structure and the demands of
our existing creditors is such that we face a clear risk of not being able to meet the obligations to our creditors. In that event,
we face a clear risk of insolvency with the result that persons who acquire our common stock may lose all or substantially all
of their investment.  

Further,
the market price of our common stock and the uncertainties of the U.S. economy, the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election and other
factors will likely negatively impact us and the financing options that we may have. Any downturn in the U.S. equity and debt
markets could also make it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing.  

Even
if we are able to raise the additional financing that we anticipate that we will require, it is possible that we could incur unexpected
costs and expenses, fail to collect amounts owed to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek
other, less-attractive alternative financing.  

Currently
we do not have any commitment from any outside financing source to meet our anticipated financing needs. Furthermore, in the event
that we were to issue additional equity or debt securities, stockholders may experience significant additional dilution or the
new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock. And
in the case of any issuance of one or more debt securities, the debt covenants may restrict our operating ability and our ability
to raise additional financing from debt.  

Overall
if we are unable to raise additional capital on terms that are reasonable in light of current market conditions will likely restrict
our ability to grow and may reduce our ability to continue to conduct business operations. We face a clear risk of insolvency
unless we are able to successfully raise significant additional capital on terms that will allow us to reduce our financial obligations
and improve our profitability and cash flow. If we are unable to obtain significant additional financing, we will likely be required
to curtail our marketing and development plans and possibly cease our operations with the clear risk of insolvency.  

We
anticipate that depending on market conditions and our plan of operations, we may incur operating losses in the foreseeable future.
Therefore, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and persons who acquire our common stock
face the risk of losing all or substantially all of their investment.  

Inflation
and Changing Prices   

Neither
inflation nor changing prices for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 had a material impact on our operations.

Critical
Accounting Policies   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
( US GAAP ) requires our management to make assumptions, estimates, and judgments that affect the amounts reported,
including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We have identified certain accounting
policies that are significant to the preparation of our financial statements. These accounting policies are important for an understanding
of our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal
of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s difficult, subjective, or complex judgment,
often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent
periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because
of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management s current judgments.  

We
believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation
of our financial statements.     We believe the critical accounting policies in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements appearing in the Annual Report, Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, affect our more significant judgments
and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.      

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant matters requiring the
use of estimates and assumptions include, but may not be limited to, accounts receivable allowances and evaluation of impairment
of long lived assets and intangible assets and the fair value of common stock issued. Management believes that its estimates and
assumptions are reasonable, based on information that is available at the time they are made.    

Item
    3.   
       Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.    

As
a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide this information.  

Item
    4.   
       Controls
    and Procedures.    

We
maintain  disclosure controls and procedures,  as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within
the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures,
no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure
controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was
required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The
design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.  

With
respect to the quarterly period ending September 30, 2016, under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based
upon this evaluation, our management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September
30, 2016 due to our limited internal resources and lack of ability to have multiple levels of transaction review. In connection
with this evaluation, management identified the following control deficiencies that represent material weaknesses as of September
30, 2016:  

(1)  
       Lack
of an independent audit committee or audit committee financial expert. Although our board of directors serves as the audit committee
it has no independent directors. These factors are counter to corporate governance practices as defined by the various stock exchanges
and may lead to less supervision over management.     

(2)  
       We
do not have sufficient experience from our accounting personnel with the requisite U.S. GAAP public company reporting experience
that is necessary for adequate controls and procedures due to our limited resources with appropriate skills, training and experience
to perform the review processes to ensure the complete and proper application of generally accepted accounting principles.    

(3)  
      Need
    for greater integration, oversight, communication and financial reporting of the books and records of our office.   

(4)  
      Lack
    of sufficient segregation of duties such that the design over these areas relies primarily on detective controls and could
    be strengthened by adding preventative controls to properly safeguard company assets.   

Changes
in Internal Controls.    

There
have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors during the fiscal quarter ended September
30, 2016, that materially affected, or is likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
    1.   
       Legal
    Proceedings.    

From
time to time, the Company is involved in litigation matters relating to claims arising from the ordinary course of business. While
the results of such claims and legal actions cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company s management does not believe
that there are claims or actions, pending or threatened against the Company, the ultimate disposition of which would have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.  

Item
    1A.   
       Risk
    Factors    

The
application of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to all tobacco products, including products like the Company s vaporizers,
will have a material adverse effect on our business.    

On
May 9, 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the issuance of a final rule (the  Rule ) deeming all
tobacco products, including  electronic cigarettes  and their components and parts, subject to the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (the FD C Act), as amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control Act).
As a result of the new Rule, all electronic cigarette products will be subject to the same FD C Act provisions and relevant
regulatory requirements to which cigarettes are subject, with respect to the following:  

1.
Enforcement action against products determined to be adulterated or misbranded (other than enforcement actions based on lack of
a marketing authorization during an applicable compliance period);  

2.
Required submission of ingredient listing and reporting of HPHCs;  

3.
Required registration of tobacco product manufacturing establishments and product listing;  

4.
Prohibition against sale and distribution of products with modified risk descriptors (e.g.,  light,   low, 
and  mild  descriptors) and claims unless FDA issues an order authorizing their marketing;  

5.
Prohibition on the distribution of free samples (same as cigarettes);  

6.
Premarket review requirements;  

7.
Implementation of minimum age and identification restrictions to prevent sales to individuals under age 18;  

8. Inclusion
of a health warning; and  

9.
Prohibition of sale of electronic cigarettes in vending machines, unless in a facility that never admits youth.  

The
application of the Rule will result in additional expenses, could affect the markets we sell our products in, could require us
to change our advertising and labeling and method of marketing our products, any of which would have a substantial adverse effect
on our business, results of operation and financial condition.  In addition, the application process of our products by the
FDA could cost the Company several hundred thousand dollars.  

We
may face the same governmental actions aimed at conventional cigarettes and other tobacco products.    

The
tobacco industry expects significant regulatory developments to take place over the next few years, driven principally by the
World Health Organization s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, or the FCTC. The FCTC is the first international public
health treaty on tobacco, and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing
initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation. Regulatory initiatives that have been proposed, introduced or enacted include:  

the
    levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges;   

restrictions
    or bans on advertising, marketing and sponsorship;   

the
    display of larger health warnings, graphic health warnings and other labeling requirements;   

restrictions
    on packaging design, including the use of colors and generic packaging;   

restrictions
    or bans on the display of tobacco product packaging at the point of sale, and restrictions or bans on cigarette vending machines;   

requirements
    regarding testing, disclosure and performance standards for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide and other smoke constituents levels;   

requirements
    regarding testing, disclosure and use of tobacco product ingredients;   

increased
    restrictions on smoking in public and work places and, in some instances, in private places and outdoors;   

elimination
    of duty free allowances for travelers; and   

encouraging
    litigation against tobacco companies.   

If
vaporizers and/or electronic cigarettes are subject to one or more significant regulatory initiates enacted under the FCTC, our
business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.  

We
are a small public company and we face ever-increasing challenges in fulfilling the ever-rising costs of regulatory compliance
under our federal, state, and other laws.    

As
a small company we have limited financial resources and we face compliance and regulatory costs that are increasing yearly. While
we believe that our business strategies are sound, we cannot assure you that we will not incur such costs and have the ability
to pass these increased costs onto our customers. As a result we may incur significant operating losses and negative cash flow
for the foreseeable future with resulting adverse impact on our continued existence as a corporation.  

Our
Total Current Liabilities were greater than our Total Current Assets as of September 30, 2016.    

As
of September 30, 2016, our Total Current Liabilities were $1,970,185 and our Total Current Assets were $381,705. As a result we
do not have sufficient cash or other liquid current assets to meet our current financial obligations that become due within the
twelve month period through September 30, 2017.  

We
need to raise additional external capital but we have received no commitment from any source to provide this capital and there
can be no assurance that we can raise any additional capital.    

We
estimate that we may need to raise $300,000 to $500,000 or more in additional external capital to meet our current and projected
financial needs. Currently we do not have any existing commitments from any reliable source to provide this capital and we cannot
assure you that we will be successful in raising the additional capital that we need or, if we are successful, that we will be
able to raise it on a timely basis and on terms that are reasonable in light of our present circumstances.  

Our
cash flow is limited and volatile with the result that we face constant financial challenges in meeting our monthly operating
and other financial obligations.    

As
a small company, our cash flow is limited and we do not have a diversified customer base with diversified customers and markets
compared to larger companies. As a result, our monthly cash flow is limited and more volatile than other larger companies. For
this reason we are exposed to greater financial risks and persons who acquire our common stock could lose all or substantially
all of their investment.  

Continuing
and increasing losses may directly impact our ability to remain in business.    

During
the three months ending September 30, 2016 we incurred $442,722 in losses and for the nine months ending September 30, 2016,
we incurred $1,459,200 in losses compared to $190,850 in losses and $551,851 in losses for the comparable periods in 2015.
The net losses include non-cash expenses primarily due to stock based compensation of $126,681 and $673,322 during the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016. While we believe that if circumstances and market conditions allow, we may be able
to achieve profitability, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts or if we are successful, that
we can sustain any profitability. If we are not successful in achieving and sustaining profitability and positive cash flow,
then persons who acquire our common stock could lose all or substantially all of their investment.
