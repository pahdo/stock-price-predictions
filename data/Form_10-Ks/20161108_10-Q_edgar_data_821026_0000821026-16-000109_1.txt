1. Basis of Presentation and Consolidation 
  These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of The Andersons, Inc. and its wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries (the  Company ). All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. 
  Investments in unconsolidated entities in which the Company has significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. 
  In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal and recurring items, considered necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows for the periods indicated, have been made. The results in these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending   December 31, 2016  .  An unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   September 30, 2015   has been included as the Company operates in several seasonal industries. 
  The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet data at December 31, 2015 was derived from the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in The Andersons, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the  2015 Form 10-K ). 
  New Accounting Standards 
  Revenue Recognition 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09, Revenue From Contracts With Customers.  They issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance in August 2015, March 2016, April 2016, and May 2016 within ASU 2015-14, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, and ASU 2016-12, respectively.  The core principle of the new revenue model is that an entity recognizes revenue from the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. These standards are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently assessing the method of adoption and the impact this standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures. 
  Leasing 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases. This standard is intended to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet with expanded disclosures around those items. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard. 
  Other applicable standards 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  This standard clarifies how companies present and classify certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows.  The standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company is currently evaluating when to adopt this standard but has not done so in the current period.  At the time of future adoption, the Company will make the election to continue classifying distributions from equity method investments using the cumulative earnings approach which is consistent with current practice.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This standard simplifies the accounting treatment for excess tax benefits and deficiencies, forfeitures, and cash flow considerations related to share-based compensation. The standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently assessing the method of adoption and the impact this standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. This standard provides guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure  
  
   9 

     Table of Contents  

of financial instruments. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard. 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. This standard requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value rather than at the lower of cost or market. The standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard. 

2. Inventories 
  Major classes of inventories are as follows: 

Inventories on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015   do not include   1.0 million  ,   3.4 million   and   3.2 million   bushels of grain, respectively, held in storage for others. The Company does not have title to the grain and is only liable for any deficiencies in grade or shortage of quantity that may arise during the storage period. Management has not experienced historical losses on any deficiencies and does not anticipate material losses in the future. 

3. Property, Plant and Equipment 
  The components of property, plant and equipment are as follows: 

Depreciation expense on property, plant and equipment was   $35.7 million   and   $34.1 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Additionally, Depreciation expense on property, plant and equipment was   $12.0 million   and   $11.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.     Capitalized software has been reclassified from property, plant, and equipment, and is now presented as a component of other intangible assets.  Prior year balance sheets have been recast to conform with the current period presentation. 
  Rail Group Assets 
  The components of Rail Group assets leased to others are as follows:

     Table of Contents  

Depreciation expense on Rail Group assets leased to others amounted to   $14.0 million   and   $12.9 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Additionally, depreciation expense on Rail Group assets leased to others amounted to   $4.7 million   and   $4.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 

4. Debt 
  The Company is party to borrowing arrangements with a syndicate of banks. See Note 5 in the Company s 2015 Form 10-K for a description of these arrangements. Total borrowing capacity for the Company under all lines of credit is currently at $  872.5 million  , including $  22.5 million   of debt of The Andersons Denison Ethanol LLC ("TADE"), which is non-recourse to the Company. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a total of $  809.9 million   available for borrowing under its lines of credit. Our borrowing capacity is reduced by a combination of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  The Company s short-term and long-term debt at   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015   consisted of the following:    

5. Derivatives 
  The Company s operating results are affected by changes to commodity prices. The Grain and Ethanol businesses have established  unhedged  position limits (the amount of a commodity, either owned or contracted for, that does not have an offsetting derivative contract to lock in the price). To reduce the exposure to market price risk on commodities owned and forward grain and ethanol purchase and sale contracts, the Company enters into exchange traded commodity futures and options contracts and over the counter forward and option contracts with various counterparties. These contracts are primarily traded via the regulated Chicago Mercantile Exchange ("CME"). The Company s forward purchase and sales contracts are for physical delivery of the commodity in a future period. Contracts to purchase commodities from producers generally relate to the current or future crop years for delivery periods quoted by regulated commodity exchanges. Contracts for the sale of commodities to processors or other commercial consumers generally do not extend beyond   one year  . 
    
  All of these contracts meet the definition of derivatives. While the Company considers its commodity contracts to be effective economic hedges, the Company does not designate or account for its commodity contracts as hedges as defined under current accounting standards. The Company accounts for its commodity derivatives at estimated fair value. The estimated fair value of the commodity derivative contracts that require the receipt or posting of cash collateral is recorded on a net basis (offset against cash collateral posted or received, also known as margin deposits) within commodity derivative assets or liabilities. Management determines fair value based on exchange-quoted prices and in the case of its forward purchase and sale contracts, estimated fair value is adjusted for differences in local markets and non-performance risk. For contracts for which physical delivery occurs, balance sheet classification is based on estimated delivery date. For futures, options and over-the-counter contracts in which physical delivery is not expected to occur but, rather, the contract is expected to be net settled, the Company classifies these contracts as current or noncurrent assets or liabilities, as appropriate, based on the Company s expectations as to when such contracts will be settled.

     Table of Contents  

Realized and unrealized gains and losses in the value of commodity contracts (whether due to changes in commodity prices, changes in performance or credit risk, or due to sale, maturity or extinguishment of the commodity contract) and grain inventories are included in cost of sales and merchandising revenues.  These amounts were previously classified in sales and merchandising revenues but were reclassified starting in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
    
  Generally accepted accounting principles permit a party to a master netting arrangement to offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments against the right to reclaim cash collateral or obligation to return cash collateral under the same master netting arrangement. The Company has master netting arrangements for its exchange traded futures and options contracts and certain over-the-counter contracts. When the Company enters into a future, option or an over-the-counter contract, an initial margin deposit may be required by the counterparty. The amount of the margin deposit varies by commodity. If the market price of a future, option or an over-the-counter contract moves in a direction that is adverse to the Company s position, an additional margin deposit, called a maintenance margin, is required. The margin deposit assets and liabilities are included in short-term commodity derivative assets or liabilities, as appropriate, in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  The following table presents at   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  , a summary of the estimated fair value of the Company s commodity derivative instruments that require cash collateral and the associated cash posted/received as collateral. The net asset or liability positions of these derivatives (net of their cash collateral) are determined on a counterparty-by-counterparty basis and are included within current or noncurrent commodity derivative assets (or liabilities) on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: 

The following table presents, on a gross basis, current and noncurrent commodity derivative assets and liabilities:

6. Employee Benefit Plans 
    
  The following are components of the net periodic benefit cost for the pension and post-retirement benefit plans maintained by the Company for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

7. Income Taxes 
    
  On a quarterly basis, the Company estimates the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full year and makes changes if necessary based on new information or events.  The estimated annual effective tax rate is forecast based on actual historical information and forward-looking estimates and is used to provide for income taxes in interim reporting periods.  The Company also recognizes the tax impact of certain unusual or infrequently occurring items, such as the effects of changes in tax laws or rates and impacts from settlements with tax authorities, discretely in the quarter in which they occur.  Additionally, the annual effective tax rate differs from the statutory U.S. Federal tax rate of   35%   primarily due to the impact of state income taxes, the tax benefit related to railroad track maintenance credit transactions, and to benefits or costs related to various permanent book to tax differences and tax credits.   
    
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded income tax expense of   $1.1 million   at an effective tax rate of   24.8%  , which varied from the U.S. Federal tax rate of   35%   primarily due to   5.8%   in discrete tax benefits related to prior years and a   3.4%   tax benefit related to railroad track maintenance credit transactions.  For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of   $1.5 million   at an effective tax rate of   61.3%  .  The higher effective tax rate in the prior year was primarily due to the cumulative impact of revised full year earnings expectations, driven by the inclusion of a one-time charge which occurred in the fourth quarter related to the termination of the Company s pension plan, and relatively low third quarter earnings. 
    
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded income tax expense of   $1.5 million   at an effective tax rate of   32.0%  , which varied from the U.S. Federal tax rate of   35%   primarily due to a   3.3%   tax benefit related to railroad track maintenance credit transactions.  The discrete tax benefits related to prior years that impacted the third quarter tax rate did not have a significant impact on the nine month effective tax rate due to an offsetting discrete tax charge related to prior years that was recorded in the first quarter.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded income tax expense of   $17.6 million   at an effective tax rate of   33.2%  . 
    
  There have been no material changes to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits reported at December 31, 2015.  During the quarter ended March 31, 2016, the IRS completed its audit of the Company s 2011 and 2012 consolidated Federal income tax returns.  The results of the examination will not have a material effect on the Company s 2016 effective tax rate.

9. Earnings Per Share 
  Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. The two-class method of computing earnings per share is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for common stock and any participating securities according to dividends declared (whether paid or unpaid) and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The Company s nonvested restricted stock that was granted prior to March 2015 is considered a participating security since the share-based awards contain a non-forfeitable right to dividends irrespective of whether the awards ultimately vest. 

There were   no   antidilutive stock-based awards outstanding at   September 30, 2016   or   September 30, 2015  .

10. Fair Value Measurements 
  The following table presents the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  : 

(a) 
    Includes associated cash posted/received as collateral 
              (b) 
    Included in "Provisionally priced contracts" are those instruments based only on underlying futures values (Level 1) and delayed price contracts (Level 2) 
              (c) 
    Recorded in  Other noncurrent assets  on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets 
              (d) 
    Included in other assets and liabilities are deferred compensation assets, ethanol risk management contracts, and foreign exchange derivative contracts (Level 1), interest rate derivatives (Level 2), and contingent consideration to the former owners of Kay Flo Industries, Inc (Level 3). 
       
  Level 1 commodity derivatives reflect the fair value of the exchange-traded futures and options contracts that the Company holds, net of the cash collateral that the Company has in its margin account. 
    
  The majority of the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on the market approach valuation technique. With the market approach, fair value is derived using prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. 
    
  The Company s net commodity derivatives primarily consist of futures or options contracts via regulated exchanges and contracts with producers or customers under which the future settlement date and bushels (or gallons in the case of ethanol contracts) of commodities to be delivered (primarily wheat, corn, soybeans and ethanol) are fixed and under which the price may or may not be fixed. Depending on the specifics of the individual contracts, the fair value is derived from the futures or  
  
   20 

     Table of Contents  

options prices on the CME or the New York Mercantile Exchange for similar commodities and delivery dates as well as observable quotes for local basis adjustments (the difference, which is attributable to local market conditions, between the quoted futures price and the local cash price). Because basis for a particular commodity and location typically has multiple quoted prices from other agribusinesses in the same geographical vicinity and is used as a common pricing mechanism in the Agribusiness industry, we have concluded that basis is a Level 2 fair value input for purposes of the fair value disclosure requirements related to our commodity derivatives. Although nonperformance risk, both of the Company and the counterparty, is present in each of these commodity contracts and is a component of the estimated fair values, based on the Company s historical experience with its producers and customers and the Company s knowledge of their businesses, the Company does not view nonperformance risk to be a material input to fair value for these commodity contracts. 
    
  These fair value disclosures exclude physical grain inventories measured at net realizable value. The net realizable value used to measure the Company s agricultural commodity inventories is the fair value (spot price of the commodity in an exchange), less cost of disposal and transportation based on the local market. This valuation would generally be considered Level 2. The amount is disclosed in Note 2 Inventories. Changes in the net realizable value of commodity inventories are recognized as a component of cost of sales and merchandising revenues. 
    
  Provisionally priced contract liabilities are those for which the Company has taken ownership and possession of grain but the final purchase price has not been established. In the case of payables where the unpriced portion of the contract is limited to the futures price of the underlying commodity or we have delivered provisionally priced grain and a subsequent payable or receivable is set up for any futures changes in the grain price, quoted CBOT prices are used and the liability is deemed to be Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. For all other unpriced contracts which include variable futures and basis components, the amounts recorded for delayed price contracts are determined on the basis of local grain market prices at the balance sheet date and, as such, are deemed to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  The risk management contract liability allows related ethanol customers to effectively unprice the futures component of their inventory for a period of time, subjecting the bushels to market fluctuations. The Company records an asset or liability for the market value changes of the commodities over the life of the contracts based on quoted CBOT prices and as such, the balance is deemed to be Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  The Company s stake in the Iowa Northern Railway Company ("IANR") was redeemed in the first quarter of 2016.  The remaining convertible preferred securities are interests in two early-stage enterprises in the form of debt securities with the possibility of conversion to equity under certain circumstances.  
  A reconciliation of beginning and ending balances for the Company s fair value measurements using Level 3 inputs is as follows:

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  The fair value of the Company s long-term debt is estimated using quoted market prices or discounted future cash flows based on the Company s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. As such, the Company has concluded that the fair value of long-term debt is considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 

The fair value of the Company s cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying value as they are close to maturity. 

11. Related Party Transactions 
  Equity Method Investments 
  The Company, directly or indirectly, holds investments in companies that are accounted for under the equity method. The Company s equity in these entities is presented at cost plus its accumulated proportional share of income or loss, less any distributions it has received. 
  On December 4, 2015, Lansing Trade Group, LLC ("LTG") agreed to the sale of equity to New Hope Liuhe Investment (USA), Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of the Chinese company, New Hope Liuhe Co. Ltd.  New Hope paid cash for a   20 percent   equity interest in LTG.  The impact of this transaction to the Company was a reduction in total ownership share of LTG from approximately   38.5 percent   to   31.0 percent   which includes dilution from newly issued shares as well as a redemption of shares that occurred on a pro rata basis between the Company and the other existing owners of LTG.  The Company recognized a total gain of   $23.1 million   on these transactions.  Cash of   $8.2 million   was received of which   $1.3 million   was a return of capital and   $6.7 million   was a return on capital.  The remainder was a book gain on cash received in excess of basis in the shares redeemed.

13. Commitments and Contingencies 
  The Company is party to litigation, or threats thereof, both as defendant and plaintiff with some regularity, although individual cases that are material in size occur infrequently. As a defendant, the Company establishes reserves for claimed amounts that are considered probable, and capable of estimation. If those cases are resolved for lesser amounts, the excess reserves are taken into income and, conversely, if those cases are resolved for larger than the amount the Company has accrued, the Company records additional expense. The Company believes it is unlikely that the results of its current legal proceedings for which it is the defendant, even if unfavorable, will be material. As a plaintiff, amounts that are collected can also result in sudden, non-recurring income.  
  Litigation results depend upon a variety of factors, including the availability of evidence, the credibility of witnesses, the performance of counsel, the state of the law, and the impressions of judges and jurors, any of which can be critical in importance, yet difficult, if not impossible, to predict. Consequently, cases currently pending, or future matters, may result in unexpected, and non-recurring losses, or income, from time to time. Finally, litigation results are often subject to judicial reconsideration, appeal and further negotiation by the parties, and as a result, the final impact of a particular judicial decision may be unknown for some time, or may result in continued reserves to account for the potential of such post-verdict actions. 
  The estimated range of loss for all outstanding claims that are considered reasonably possible is not material.  
  Build-to-Suit Lease 
  In August, 2015, the Company entered into a lease agre  ement with an initial term of     15 years     for a build-to-suit facility to be used as the new corporate headquarters which was completed in the third quarter of 2016.  Since the Company is deemed to be the owner of this facility for accounting purposes during the construction period, we have recognized an asset and a corresponding financing obligation.    
  As of September 30, 2016, we have recorded a build-to-suit financing obligation of   $13.7 million   in other long-term liabilities and   $1.3 million   in other current liabilities. 

14. Supplemental Cash Flow Information           
  Certain supplemental cash flow information, including noncash investing and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows: 

15. Business Acquisitions 
    
  There were   no   business acquisitions completed in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Prior Year Business Acquisitions 
    
  On May 18, 2015, the Company purchased Kay Flo Industries, Inc. and certain subsidiaries. The Company acquired   100%   of the outstanding shares of Kay Flo Industries, Inc.  In connection with the acquisition, the Company agreed to pay contingent consideration based on the achievement of specified objectives, including reaching targeted gross profit thresholds.  The range of undiscounted amounts the Company could be required to pay under the contingent consideration arrangement is between   $0   and   $24 million  .  
    
  The total fair value of consideration for the acquisitions was   $129.4 million  , including working capital and   $0.4 million   in estimated fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement.  The Company has funded this transaction with long-term debt, short-term debt, and cash on hand. The debt has been drawn from the Company's existing line of credit. The purchase price allocation was finalized as of December 31, 2015.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Our critical accounting policies and critical accounting estimates, as described in our 2015 Form 10-K, have not materially changed through the third quarter of 2016. 
  Executive Overview 
    
  Our operations are organized, managed and classified into five reportable business segments: Grain, Ethanol, Plant Nutrient, Rail, and Retail. Each of these segments is based on the nature of products and services offered. 
    
  The agricultural commodity-based business is one in which changes in selling prices generally move in relationship to changes in purchase prices. Therefore, increases or decreases in prices of the agricultural commodities that the business deals in will have a relatively equal impact on sales and cost of sales and a much less significant impact on gross profit. As a result, changes in sales for the period may not necessarily be indicative of the overall performance of the business and more focus should be placed on changes to gross profit. 
  Grain Group 
  The Grain Group's performance in the third quarter reflects continued performance challenges in its core grain assets, as well as lower returns from affiliates. Overall results did improve, primarily due to the divestiture of underperforming assets in Iowa during the first half of 2016.  The impact of the challenged harvest in the prior year continued to limit opportunities for space income and earnings from blending activities.  
  Grain inventories on hand at September 30, 2016 were 67.0 million bushels, of which 1.0 million bushels were stored for others. This compares to 67.3 million bushels on hand at September 30, 2015, of which 3.2 million bushels were stored for others. Total grain storage capacity was approximately 152 million bushels at September 30, 2016 compared to 163 million bushels at September 30, 2015 due to the sale of Iowa grain assets and the construction of a new elevator in Tennessee. 
  Based on preliminary indications, the Grain Group is expecting an increase in soybean and corn production in our core markets in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year.  
  Ethanol Group 
  The Ethanol Group's third quarter results reflect improvements in overall margins as reductions in corn and natural gas input prices were only partially offset by modest decreases in the sales price of ethanol.  Additionally, higher prices were realized on ethanol by-products in relation to the cost of the underlying corn inputs.  Driving demand remains strong which supports high sales volumes.

     Table of Contents  

Ethanol volumes shipped for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: 

* DDG tons shipped converts wet tons to a dry ton equivalent amount 
    
  The above table shows only shipped volumes that flow through the Company's sales revenues. Total ethanol, corn oil and DDG production by the unconsolidated LLCs are higher, however, the portion of this volume that is sold directly to their customers is excluded here.  
  Plant Nutrient Group 
  The Plant Nutrient Group's results reflect price declines, particularly in base nutrient products, which has put pressure on overall margins.  Volumes have also declined compared to the prior year as a result of lower farm income and a market that continues to experience uncertainty around future nutrient prices leading to lower immediate demand. 
    
  Storage capacity at our wholesale nutrient and farm center facilities, including leased storage, was approximately 488 thousand tons for dry nutrients and approximately 547 thousand tons for liquid nutrients at September 30, 2016 and approximately 508 thousand tons for dry nutrients and approximately 546 thousand tons for liquid nutrients at September 30, 2015. The decrease in our dry storage capacity is a result of the sale of Iowa farm center assets in the second quarter of 2016. 
    
  Tons of product shipped (including sales and service tons) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: 

Margins in our wholesale fertilizer business continue to be under pressure due to an uncertain outlook for future crop prices and decreased domestic demand for fertilizer.  The analysis of goodwill held by this reporting unit is subject to changes in key assumptions that affect the calculated fair value at the annual October 1 assessment date as the annual budgeting and long-term planning process is completed.  The goodwill fair value is highly sensitive to changes in those assumptions, including interest rates and outlook for future volume and margins.  If recent weakness in our wholesale fertilizer business affects our forecast for future years, this may result in a goodwill impairment charge.  Total goodwill in the wholesale nutrient reporting unit is $59.1 million. 
  Rail Group 
  The Rail Group saw a decline in average utilization rates from 91.6 percent in the third quarter of 2015 to 86.2 percent in the third quarter of 2016.  Average lease rates remained relatively flat.  Railcars, locomotives, and barges under management (owned, leased or managed for financial institutions in non-recourse arrangements) at September 30, 2016 were 23,203 compared to 23,301 at September 30, 2015.  
  Utilization rates are under pressure due to substantial increases in operational efficiency of the railroads in North America driving a decrease in the number of cars needed to move the same volume of freight.  This has made it more difficult for us to re-market cars as they are returned from existing leases.  
  The Group will continue to focus on ways to strategically grow the rail fleet and look for opportunities to open new repair facilities.

Retail Group 
  The retail industry is highly competitive. Our stores compete with a variety of retail merchandisers, including home centers, department and hardware stores, as well as local and national grocers.  In the fourth quarter of 2016, we announced the closure of our specialty food concept store.

Operating Results 
  The following discussion focuses on the operating results as shown in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations with a separate discussion by segment. Additional segment information is included in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements herein in Note 12. Segment Information. 

Comparison of the three months ended   September 30, 2016   with the three months ended   September 30, 2015  : 
  Grain Group 

Operating results for the Grain Group have increased $1.7 million compared to the results of the same period last year.  Sales and merchandising revenues increased $4.9 million. This was partially offset by an increase of cost of sales and merchandising revenues for a net favorable gross profit impact of $0.5 million.  The increase was driven by improved trading income, and partially offset by modest declines in margins on sale of grain, income from blending operations, and limited opportunities for basis appreciation.  Additionally, the 2016 divestiture of Iowa grain assets reduced gross profit by $1.5 million.  However, it also provided a $3.0 million reduction in other, administrative and general expenses for a net positive impact of $1.5 million compared to the same quarter in 2015. 
    
  Operating, administrative and general expenses showed a decrease of $3.3 million compared to the same period in 2015 due primarily to decreases in labor and benefit costs and the Iowa divestiture noted above. 
    
  Equity in earnings of affiliates were not a major driver of performance in the current quarter with a decrease of $0.8 million compared to the same period in 2015.

     Table of Contents  

Ethanol Group 

Operating results for the Ethanol Group increased $3.7 million from the same period last year.  Sales and merchandising revenues increased $1.6 million compared to the results of the same period last year with cost of sales and merchandising revenues increasing by a similar amount.   These changes were due to minor fluctuations in ethanol sales prices and volumes related to our consolidated operations during the quarter but were not a significant driver of results. 
    
  Equity in earnings of affiliates increased $5.4 million due to higher earnings from the unconsolidated ethanol LLCs.  This was driven by a variety of factors.  Corn and natural gas input prices declined more than the price of the ethanol being produced, increasing margins during the current period in the markets where we operate our unconsolidated ethanol facilities.  Additionally, the ratio of price realized on ethanol by-products relative to the price of corn inputs improved. 
  Plant Nutrient Group 

Operating results for the Plant Nutrient Group improved $3.9 million from the same period last year. Sales and merchandising revenues decreased $47.5 million primarily due to significant declines in fertilizer prices as well as a 6.9 percent decline in total tons sold. The decrease in cost of sales and merchandising revenues follows the commodity price and volume declines noted above.  Additionally, we saw margin compression in products used in agricultural end markets. The total impact of the volume decreases and lower margins to gross profit was a decrease of $2.9 million.  The primary driver of performance during the current quarter has been pressure on farmer income causing nutrient purchases to be deferred or reduced. 
    
  Operating, administrative, and general expenses decreased $6.8 million, primarily due to decreased labor and benefits cost as well as a $2.0 million goodwill impairment charge related to the cob business in the prior year.

Rail Group 

Operating results for the Rail Group decreased $5.2 million from the same period last year. Sales and merchandising revenues decreased $6.6 million, partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease in cost of sales.  The net gross profit decline of $5.0 million was primarily driven by a $2.6 million reduction in base leasing margin due to lower utilization rates and a decrease of $1.6 million in gains on the sale of railcars.  
    
  The decline in other income of $1.6 million was due mostly to a $0.6 million decline in end of lease settlement activity and prior year dividends of $0.5 million on our investment in Iowa Northern Railway Corporation which was sold in 2016. 
  Retail Group 

Operating results for the Retail Group declined from the same period last year, with a 4% decrease in customer count, partially offset by a slight decline in general expenses. 
  Other 

The other operating loss not allocated to business segments decreased $2.2 million compared to the same period in the prior year.  The majority of the change was a $2.8 million decrease in interest expense due to lower borrowing during the period as well as mark-to-market adjustments on interest rate derivative contracts.  This was offset by increased operating,

     Table of Contents  

administrative, and general expenses which were primarily due to the timing of certain employee benefit charges being incurred and allocated to the operating segments compared to the prior year. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  Income tax expense of $1.1 million was provided at 24.8% in the current quarter. In the third quarter of 2015, income tax benefit of $1.5 million was provided at 61.3%.  The high 2015 effective tax rate is primarily due to the cumulative impact of revised full year earnings expectations and relatively low third quarter earnings, while the lower 2016 effective tax rate is primarily due to tax benefits related to railroad track maintenance credit transactions and tax benefits related to prior years.  
    
  The Company anticipates that its 2016 effective annual rate will be 30.7%. The Company s actual 2015 effective tax rate was a benefit of 2.1%.  The lower benefit rate in 2015 relative to our losses before income taxes is primarily due to the impact of the 2015 write-off of goodwill that did not provide a corresponding tax benefit.   
  Comparison of the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   with the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  : 
  Grain Group 

Operating results for the Grain Group have decreased $32.6 million compared to the results of the same period last year.  Sales and merchandising revenues decreased $93.4 million. This was partially offset by a decrease of cost of sales and merchandising revenues of $73.0 million for a net unfavorable gross profit impact of $20.4 million.  This decrease was primarily driven by elevated basis levels in the eastern corn belt causing significant reductions in space income and basis appreciation as well as reduced opportunities to earn margins on grain purchases and sales.  Additionally, we saw reduced gross profit of $3.2 million from the sale of our Iowa grain assets in 2016. 
    
  Operating, administrative and general expenses showed a decrease of $5.9 million compared to the same period in 2015, $5.3 million of which was due to prior year expenses incurred at the underperforming assets in Iowa which were sold earlier in the year and lower labor and benefit expenses.   
    
  The reductions in gross profit and expenses noted above in relation to the sale of Iowa assets have combined for a net positive impact of $2.1 million so far this year, excluding the impact of the sale transaction itself. 
    
  Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased $16.9 million compared to the same period in 2015.  This was driven by reduced performance at Lansing Trade Group.

Ethanol Group 

Operating results for the Ethanol Group decreased $7.8 million compared to the results of the same period last year.  Sales and merchandising revenues decreased $16.5 million, due to a decline in the average price of ethanol and a decrease in DDG prices. Ethanol gallons sold were up 1.3 percent compared to the prior year. The $11.3 million decrease in cost of sales is due to lower input costs, primarily corn and natural gas.  The ethanol plants' performance was also unfavorably impacted by pricing pressure on ethanol byproducts compared to the prior year. 
  Plant Nutrient Group 

Operating results for the Plant Nutrient Group increased $9.8 million from the same period last year. Sales and merchandising revenues decreased $71.6 million primarily due to significant declines in fertilizer prices. The decrease in cost of sales and merchandising revenues of $76.3 million exceeds the impact of lower sales noted above due to a decrease in the cost of raw materials and is also impacted by an increase in the proportion of higher margin specialty products. The total net positive impact to gross profit of the items noted above was $4.7 million. 
    
  Operating, administrative, and general expenses decreased $5.3 million due primarily to a $2.3 million decrease in labor and benefits as well as a $1.4 million reduction in maintenance costs compared to the prior year.

Rail Group 

Operating results for the Rail Group decreased $21.2 million from the same period last year. Sales and merchandising revenues decreased $16.3 million, partially offset by a $4.0 million decrease in cost of sales.  The net gross profit decline of $12.3 million was primarily driven by a decrease of $6.0 million in gains on the sale of railcars, and a $4.2 million reduction in base leasing margin caused by lower utilization rates compared to the prior year. 
    
  The decline in other income of $12.8 million is primarily driven by higher than normal lease settlement activity in the prior year.  
  Retail Group 

Operating results for the Retail Group declined by $1.2 million from the same period last year.  This was driven primarily by a  3% decrease in customer count. 
  Other 

The other operating loss not allocated to business segments decreased $4.3 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Interest expense declined due to mark-to-market adjustments on interest rate derivative contracts.  
    
  The majority of the change in other income was a $1.3 million gain on final settlement of our pension plan.

Income Taxes 
    
  Income tax expense of $1.5 million was provided at 32.0%.  In 2015, income tax expense of $17.6 million was provided at 33.2%.  The lower 2016 effective tax rate is due primarily to a tax benefit related to railroad track maintenance credit transactions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Working Capital 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had working capital of   $230.9 million  . The following table presents changes in the components of current assets and current liabilities: 

In comparison to September 30, 2015, current assets decreased significantly.  This was primarily due to declining commodity prices resulting in a decline in the value of both inventory and accounts receivable in our Grain and Plant Nutrient segments. This was partially offset by increases in our cash on hand compared to the prior year which is caused by a reduced need for margin deposits on our grain contracts due to the lower prices. 
  Current liabilities were down compared to the prior year due to many of the same factors driving the changes in our current assets.  We paid off all of our short-term line of credit borrowings due to reduced margin needs in the grain business.  Additionally, our accounts payable balance is lower due to substantial declines in prices for recently purchased fertilizer and grain inventory.  This was partially offset by a greater portion of our long-term debt becoming current compared to the prior year.  
  Sources and Uses of Cash 
  Operating Activities 
  Our operating activities provided cash of   $41.3 million   and   $57.8 million   in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. The cash provided year to date is primarily a result of seasonal changes in the use of working capital, particularly the fact that we have seen significant reductions in prepaid fertilizer balances compared to the beginning of the period and that our prepaid income tax balances have declined compared to the prior year.  
  Investing Activities 
  Investing activities provided cash of $4.8 million through the first nine months of 2016, compared to using cash of $212.4 million in the prior year.  This change is due to $124.6 million for the prior year acquisition of Kay Flo Industries, Inc, net of cash received and prior to final working capital adjustments, as well as a $33.5 million decrease in net spend on railcar acquisitions and sales.  Cash provided in the current year was positively impacted by the $54.3 million sale of underperforming assets in Iowa as well as the redemption of our investment in the Iowa Northern Railway Corporation which provided proceeds of $13.5 million.  We also received $7.4 million in return of capital distributions from our ethanol investments.  This was offset by a $13.8 million increase in purchases of other property, plant, and equipment. The variability in railcar purchases and sales is driven by timing of opportunities in the Rail Group asset market.   
  
   38 

     Table of Contents  

In 2016, we expect to spend a total of $99.8 million for the purchase of railcars, barges and related leases and capitalized modifications of railcars. We also expect to offset this amount by proceeds from the sales and dispositions of approximately $73.9 million during the year.  
  Additionally, total capital spending for 2016 on property, plant and equipment in our base business excluding rail leasing activity, but inclusive of information technology spending and the construction of a new corporate headquarters building is expected to be approximately $106.4 million.  
  Financing Activities 
  Financing activities used cash of $31.7 million and provided cash of $80.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Short term borrowings used cash of $15.0 million in the current year compared to providing cash of $79.7 million in the prior year.  This change was driven primarily by declines in commodity prices and associated working capital requirements.  In addition, the current year saw a decrease of $74.6 million in funds provided by long-term debt issuance, but this was largely offset by $49.1 million in prior year repurchases of the company's common stock.  We also received $14.0 million in reimbursement payments related to the long-term financing agreement of our new corporate headquarters.   
  We are party to borrowing arrangements with a syndicate of banks that provides a total of $872.5 million in borrowings, which includes $22.5 million of debt of The Andersons Denison Ethanol LLC which is non-recourse to the Company. Of that total, we had $  809.9 million   remaining available for borrowing at September 30, 2016. Peak short-term borrowings to date were $412.0 million on January 6, 2016. Typically, our highest borrowing occurs in the late Winter and early Spring due to seasonal inventory requirements in our fertilizer and grain businesses.   
    
  We paid $13.0 million in dividends in the first nine months of 2016 compared to $12.0 million in the prior year. We paid $0.155 per common share for the dividends paid in January, April, and July 2016, and $0.14 per common share for the dividends paid in January, April, and July 2015. On August 26, 2016, we declared a cash dividend of $0.155 per common share payable on October 24, 2016 to shareholders of record on October 3, 2016.  
  Certain of our long-term borrowings include covenants that, among other things, impose minimum levels of equity and limitations on additional debt. We are in compliance with all such covenants as of September 30, 2016. In addition, certain of our long-term borrowings are collateralized by first mortgages on various facilities or are collateralized by railcar assets. Our non-recourse long-term debt is collateralized by ethanol plant assets. 
  Because we are a significant consumer of short-term debt in peak seasons and the majority of this is variable rate debt, increases in interest rates could have a significant impact on our profitability. In addition, periods of high grain prices and/or unfavorable market conditions could require us to make additional margin deposits on our exchange traded futures contracts. Conversely, in periods of declining prices, we receive a return of cash. 
  We believe our sources of liquidity will be adequate to fund our operations, capital expenditures and payments of dividends in the foreseeable future.

Off-Balance Sheet Transactions 
    
  Our Rail Group utilizes leasing arrangements that provide off-balance sheet financing for its activities. We lease assets from financial intermediaries through sale-leaseback transactions, the majority of which involve operating leasebacks. Rail Group assets we own or lease from a financial intermediary are generally leased to a customer under an operating lease. We also arrange non-recourse lease transactions under which we sell assets to a financial intermediary, and assign the related operating lease to the financial intermediary on a non-recourse basis. In such arrangements, we generally provide ongoing maintenance and management services for the financial intermediary, and receive a fee for such services. On most of the assets, we hold an option to purchase the assets at the end of the lease.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
  For further information, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. There were no material changes in market risk, specifically commodity and interest rate risk during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer ("Certifying Officers"), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  
  As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report.  Based on the results of this evaluation, management concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  Management concluded that the Company s system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015.  As required by Rule 13a-15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of any change in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting. The Company is undertaking the phased implementation of an ERP software system. The Company believes it is maintaining and monitoring appropriate internal controls during the implementation period and further believes that its internal control environment will be enhanced as a result of this implementation.  There have been no other changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting during the Company s most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting.

Part II. Other Information 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
  We are currently subject to various claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of business, which include environmental issues, employment claims, contractual disputes, and defensive counter claims. We accrue liabilities where litigation losses are deemed probable and estimable. We believe it is unlikely that the results of our current legal proceedings, even if unfavorable, will be materially different from what we currently have accrued. There can be no assurance, however, that any claims or suits arising in the future, whether taken individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
  Our operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in this Form 10-Q and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. These risks can be impacted by factors beyond our control as well as by errors and omissions on our part. The most significant factors known to us that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results are described in our 2015 Form 10-K (Item 1A).
