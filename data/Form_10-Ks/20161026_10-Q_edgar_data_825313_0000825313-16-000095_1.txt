  September 30, 2016    
  (unaudited) 
    
  The words  we  and  our  refer collectively to AllianceBernstein Holding L.P. ( AB Holding ) and AllianceBernstein L.P.  and its subsidiaries ( AB ), or to their officers and employees. Similarly, the word  company  refers to both AB Holding and AB. Where the context requires distinguishing between AB Holding and AB, we identify which of them is being discussed. 

1. 
    Business Description, Organization and Basis of Presentation 
       
  Business Description 
    
  AB Holding s principal source of income and cash flow is attributable to its investment in AB limited partnership interests. The condensed financial statements and notes of AB Holding should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes of AB included as an exhibit to this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and with AB Holding s and AB s audited financial statements included in AB Holding s Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  AB provides research, diversified investment management and related services globally to a broad range of clients. Its principal services include: 

Institutional Services   servicing its institutional clients, including private and public pension plans, foundations and endowments, insurance companies, central banks and governments worldwide, and affiliates such as AXA and its subsidiaries, by means of separately-managed accounts, sub-advisory relationships, structured products, collective investment trusts, mutual funds, hedge funds and other investment vehicles.

  AB s high-quality, in-depth research is the foundation of its business. AB s research disciplines include economic, fundamental equity, fixed income and quantitative research. In addition, AB has experts focused on multi-asset strategies, wealth management and alternative investments. 
    
  AB provides a broad range of investment services with expertise in:

Actively-managed traditional and unconstrained fixed income strategies, including taxable and tax-exempt strategies; 

Passive management, including index and enhanced index strategies; 

Alternative investments, including hedge funds, fund of funds and private equity (  e.g.  , direct real estate investing); and 

Multi-asset solutions and services, including dynamic asset allocation, customized target-date funds and target-risk funds. 

5 

     Index  

AB s services span various investment disciplines, including market capitalization (  e.g.  , large-, mid- and small-cap equities), term (  e.g.  , long-, intermediate- and short-duration debt securities), and geographic location (  e.g.  , U.S., international, global, emerging markets, regional and local), in major markets around the world. 
    
  Organization 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , AXA, a   soci t  anonyme   organized under the laws of France and the holding company for the AXA Group, a worldwide leader in financial protection, through certain of its subsidiaries ( AXA and its subsidiaries ) owns approximately   1.5%   of the issued and outstanding units representing assignments of beneficial ownership of limited partnership interests in AB Holding ( AB Holding Units ). 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the ownership structure of AB, expressed as a percentage of general and limited partnership interests, is as follows: 

AllianceBernstein Corporation (an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of AXA,  General Partner ) is the general partner of both AB Holding and AB. AllianceBernstein Corporation owns   100,000   general partnership units in AB Holding and a   1%   general partnership interest in AB. Including both the general partnership and limited partnership interests in AB Holding and AB, AXA and its subsidiaries have an approximate   64.2%   economic interest in AB as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The interim condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the interim results, have been made. The preparation of the condensed financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the interim reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The condensed statement of financial condition as of   December 31, 2015   was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
    
  AB Holding records its investment in AB using the equity method of accounting. AB Holding s investment is increased to reflect its proportionate share of income of AB and decreased to reflect its proportionate share of losses of AB and cash distributions made by AB to its Unitholders. In addition, AB Holding's investment is adjusted to reflect its proportionate share of certain capital transactions of AB. 
    
  Revision  
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, AB identified an error that has been impacting the calculation of its tax provision since 2010. As a result of this error, which impacted our equity in net income attributable to AB Unitholders, AB revised its previously issued financial statements and we revised Holding's financial statements.  
    
  In regard to the revision of Holding's previously issued financial statements, we recorded a cumulative adjustment to our 2012 partners' capital account and revised our statements of financial condition and statements of income from 2012 through the second quarter of 2016. As of December 31, 2015, the cumulative impact of the revision on partners  capital in the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition was   $13.8 million  . We revised our equity in net income attributable to AB Unitholders, net income, and basic and diluted net income per unit reported in prior periods in the condensed statements of income. The tables below reflect the revisions to these line items for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015 presented in this Form 10-Q, as well as the six months ended June 30, 2016, which impacted the financial results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Other periods that have been revised, including the three months ended June 30, 2016, will appear in our future annual and quarterly filings.

    Cash Distributions  
       
  AB Holding is required to distribute all of its Available Cash Flow, as defined in the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of AB Holding ( AB Holding Partnership Agreement ), to its Unitholders   pro rata   in accordance with their percentage interests in AB Holding. Available Cash Flow is defined as the cash distributions AB Holding receives from AB minus such amounts as the General Partner determines, in its sole discretion, should be retained by AB Holding for use in its business or plus such amounts as the General Partner determines, in its sole discretion, should be released from previously retained cash flow. 
    
  On   October 26, 2016  , the General Partner declared a distribution of   $0.45   per unit, representing a distribution of Available Cash Flow for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . Each general partnership unit in AB Holding is entitled to receive distributions equal to those received by each AB Holding Unit. The distribution is payable on   November 17, 2016   to holders of record at the close of business on   November 7, 2016  .

3. 
    Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans 
       
  AB maintains several unfunded, non-qualified long-term incentive compensation plans, under which the company grants awards of restricted AB Holding Units and options to buy AB Holding Units to its employees and members of the Board of Directors, who are not employed by AB or by any of AB s affiliates ( Eligible Directors ). 
    
  AB funds its restricted AB Holding Unit awards either by purchasing AB Holding Units on the open market or purchasing newly-issued AB Holding Units from AB Holding, and then keeping all of these AB Holding Units in a consolidated rabbi trust until delivering them or retiring them. In accordance with the AB Holding Partnership Agreement, when AB purchases newly-issued AB Holding Units from AB Holding, AB Holding is required to use the proceeds it receives from AB to purchase the equivalent number of newly-issued AB Units, thus increasing its percentage ownership interest in AB. AB Holding Units held in the consolidated rabbi trust are corporate assets in the name of the trust and are available to the general creditors of AB. 
    
  During the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2016  , AB purchased   2.0 million   and   5.8 million   AB Holding Units for   $45.2 million   and   $129.2 million  , respectively (on a trade date basis). These amounts reflect open-market purchases of   2.0 million   and   5.7 million   AB Holding Units for   $45.1 million   and   $127.1 million  , respectively, with the remainder relating to purchases of AB Holding Units from employees to allow them to fulfill statutory tax withholding requirements at the time of distribution of long-term incentive compensation awards. During the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2015  , AB purchased   3.0 million   and   3.8 million   AB Holding Units for   $82.1 million   and   $103.4 million  , respectively (on a trade date basis). These amounts reflected open-market purchases of   3.0 million   and   3.7 million   AB Holding Units for   $82.1 million   and   $101.1 million  , respectively, with the remainder relating to purchases of AB Holding Units from employees to allow them to fulfill statutory tax withholding requirements at the time of distribution of long-term incentive compensation awards. 
    
  Each quarter, AB implements plans to repurchase AB Holding Units pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act ). A Rule 10b5-1 plan allows a company to repurchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so because of self-imposed trading blackout periods or because it possesses material non-public information. Each broker selected by AB has the authority under the terms and limitations specified in the plan to repurchase AB Holding Units on AB s behalf in accordance with the terms of the plan. Repurchases are subject to regulations promulgated by the SEC as well as certain price, market volume and timing constraints specified in the plan. The plan adopted during the   third   quarter of   2016   expired at the close of business on October 25, 2016. AB may adopt additional Rule 10b5-1 plans in the future to engage in open-market purchases of AB Holding Units to help fund anticipated obligations under its incentive compensation award program and for other corporate purposes. 
    
  During the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , AB granted to employees and Eligible Directors   0.7 million   and   0.3 million   restricted AB Holding Unit awards, respectively. AB used AB Holding Units repurchased during the period and newly-issued AB Holding Units to fund the restricted AB Holding Unit awards. 
    
  During the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , AB Holding issued   0.1 million   and   0.5 million   AB Holding Units, respectively, upon exercise of options to buy AB Holding Units. AB Holding used the proceeds of   $2.4 million   and   $9.0 million  , respectively, received from employees as payment in cash for the exercise price to purchase the equivalent number of newly-issued AB Units. 

4. 
    Net Income per Unit 
       
  Basic net income per unit is derived by dividing net income by the basic weighted average number of units outstanding for each period. Diluted net income per unit is derived by adjusting net income for the assumed dilutive effect of compensatory options ( Net income   diluted ) and dividing by the diluted weighted average number of units outstanding for each period.

     Index  

For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we excluded   2,873,106   options from the diluted net income computation due to their anti-dilutive effect. For the   three and nine    months ended   September 30, 2015  , we excluded   2,771,250   and   2,383,589   options, respectively, from the diluted net income computation due to their anti-dilutive effect.

7. 
    Income Taxes 
       
  AB Holding is a  grandfathered  publicly-traded partnership ( PTP ) for federal tax purposes and, accordingly, is not subject to federal or state corporate income taxes. However, AB Holding is subject to the   4.0%   New York City unincorporated business tax ( UBT ), net of credits for UBT paid by AB, and to a   3.5%   federal tax on partnership gross income from the active conduct of a trade or business. AB Holding s partnership gross income is derived from its interest in AB. 
    
  AB Holding s income tax is computed by multiplying certain AB qualifying revenues (primarily U.S. investment advisory fees and brokerage commissions) by AB Holding s ownership interest in AB, multiplied by the   3.5%   tax rate. AB Holding Units in AB s consolidated rabbi trust are not treated as outstanding for purposes of calculating AB Holding s ownership interest in AB. 

In order to preserve AB Holding s status as a  grandfathered  PTP for federal income tax purposes, management seeks to ensure that AB Holding does not directly or indirectly (through AB) enter into a substantial new line of business. If AB Holding were to lose its status as a  grandfathered  PTP, it would be subject to corporate income tax, which would reduce materially AB Holding s net income and its quarterly distributions to AB Holding Unitholders. 

8. 
    Commitments and Contingencies 
       
  Legal and regulatory matters described below pertain to AB and are included here due to their potential significance to AB Holding s investment in AB. 
    
  With respect to all significant litigation matters, we consider the likelihood of a negative outcome. If we determine the likelihood of a negative outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record an estimated loss for the expected outcome of the litigation. If the likelihood of a negative outcome is reasonably possible and we are able to determine an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts already accrued, if any, we disclose that fact together with the estimate of the possible loss or range of loss. However, it is often difficult to predict the outcome or estimate a possible loss or range of loss because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, particularly when plaintiffs allege substantial or indeterminate damages. Such is also the case when the litigation is in its early stages or when the litigation is highly complex or broad in scope. In these cases, we disclose that we are unable to predict the outcome or estimate a possible loss or range of loss. 
  
   10 

     Index  

During the first quarter of 2012, AB received a legal letter of claim ( Letter of Claim ) sent on behalf of Philips Pension Trustees Limited and Philips Electronics U.K. Limited ( Philips ), a former pension fund client, alleging that AllianceBernstein Limited (one of AB s subsidiaries organized in the U.K.) was negligent and failed to meet certain applicable standards of care with respect to the initial investment in, and management of, a    500 million   portfolio of U.S. mortgage-backed securities. Philips has alleged damages ranging between   $177 million   and   $234 million  , plus compound interest on an alleged   $125 million   of realized losses in the portfolio. On January 2, 2014, Philips filed a claim form ( Claim ) in the High Court of Justice in London, England, which formally commenced litigation with respect to the allegations in the Letter of Claim.  
    
  We believe that any losses to Philips resulted from adverse developments in the U.S. housing and mortgage market that precipitated the financial crisis in 2008 and not from any negligence or other failure or malfeasance on our part. We believe that we have strong defenses to these claims, which are set forth in our October 12, 2012 response to the Letter of Claim and our June 27, 2014 Statement of Defence in response to the Claim, and intend to defend this matter vigorously. 
    
  In addition to the Claim   discussed immediately above  , AB is involved in various other matters, including regulatory inquiries, administrative proceedings and litigation, some of which allege significant damages. 
    
  In the opinion of AB s management, an adequate accrual has been made as of   September 30, 2016   to provide for any probable losses regarding any litigation matters for which management can reasonably estimate an amount of loss. It is reasonably possible that AB could incur additional losses pertaining to these matters, but currently management cannot estimate any such additional losses. 
    
  Management, after consultation with legal counsel, currently believes that the outcome of any individual matter that is pending or threatened, or all of them combined, will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. However, any inquiry, proceeding or litigation has an element of uncertainty; management cannot determine whether further developments relating to any individual matter that is pending or threatened, or all of them combined, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity in any future reporting period.

Item 2. 
    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
       
  AB Holding s principal source of income and cash flow is attributable to its investment in AB Units. AB Holding s interim condensed financial statements and notes and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( MD A ) should be read in conjunction with those of AB included as an exhibit to this Form 10-Q. They also should be read in conjunction with AB s audited financial statements and notes and MD A included in AB Holding s Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

Results of Operations 

During the third quarter of 2016, AB identified an error that has been impacting the calculation of its tax provision since 2010. As a result of this error, which impacted our equity in net income attributable to AB Unitholders, AB revised its previously issued financial statements and we revised Holding's financial statements.   See Note 1 to the condensed financial statements contained in Item 1   for further discussion. 
    
  Net income for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   increased $8.2 million and $9.2 million, respectively, due to higher net income attributable to AB Unitholders, offset by a lower weighted average equity ownership interest.  
    
  AB Holding s partnership gross income is derived from its interest in AB. AB Holding s income taxes, which reflect a 3.5% federal tax on its partnership gross income from the active conduct of a trade or business, are computed by multiplying certain AB qualifying revenues (primarily U.S. investment advisory fees and brokerage commissions) by AB Holding s ownership interest in AB (adjusted for AB Holding Units owned by AB s consolidated rabbi trust), multiplied by the 3.5% tax rate. AB Holding s effective tax rate was 10.1% in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to 13.0% during the   third   quarter of   2015  . AB Holding's effective tax rate during the   nine     months ended   September 30, 2016     was 10.5%, compared to 12.1% during the   nine     months ended   September 30, 2015  .   See Note 7     to the condensed financial statements contained in Item 1   for the calculation of income tax expense. 

Management Operating Metrics 
    
  As supplemental information, AB provides the performance measures  adjusted net revenues ,  adjusted operating income  and  adjusted operating margin , which are the principal metrics management uses in evaluating and comparing the period-to-period operating performance of AB. Management principally uses these metrics in evaluating performance because they present a clearer picture of AB's operating performance and allow management to see long-term trends without the distortion primarily caused by long-term incentive compensation-related mark-to-market adjustments, real estate consolidation charges and other adjustment items. Similarly, management believes that these management operating metrics help investors better understand the underlying trends in AB's results and, accordingly, provide a valuable perspective for investors. Such measures are not based on generally accepted accounting principles ( non-GAAP measures ). These non-GAAP measures are provided in addition to, and not as  
  
   12 

     Index  

substitutes for, net revenues, operating income and operating margin, and they may not be comparable to non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. Management uses both the GAAP and non-GAAP measures in evaluating the company s financial performance. The non-GAAP measures alone may pose limitations because they do not include all of AB s revenues and expenses. Further, adjusted diluted net income per AB Holding Unit is not a liquidity measure and should not be used in place of cash flow measures.   See AB s MD A contained in Exhibit 99.1  . 
    
  The impact of these adjustments on AB Holding s net income and diluted net income per AB Holding Unit are as follows: 

The degree to which AB's non-GAAP adjustments impact AB Holding's net income fluctuates based on AB Holding's ownership percentage in AB. 

Cash Distributions 
    
  AB Holding is required to distribute all of its Available Cash Flow, as defined in the AB Holding Partnership Agreement, to its Unitholders (including the General Partner). Available Cash Flow typically is the adjusted diluted net income per unit for the quarter multiplied by the number of units outstanding at the end of the quarter. Management anticipates that Available Cash Flow will continue to be based on adjusted diluted net income per unit, unless management determines, with concurrence of the Board of Directors, that one or more non-GAAP adjustments that are made for adjusted net income should not be made with respect to the Available Cash Flow calculation.   See Note 2 to the condensed financial statements contained in Item 1   for a description of Available Cash Flow. 

Capital Resources and Liquidity 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , net cash provided by operating activities was $127.0 million, compared to $149.8 million during the corresponding 2015 period. The decrease primarily resulted from lower cash distributions received from AB of $24.5 million. 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , net cash used in investing activities was $2.4 million, compared to $9.0 million during the corresponding 2015 period. The decrease reflects lower investments in AB with proceeds from exercises of compensatory options to buy AB Holding Units. 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , net cash used in financing activities was $124.6 million, compared to $140.8 million during the corresponding 2015 period. The decrease was due to lower cash distributions to Unitholders of $23.2 million, offset by lower proceeds from exercises of compensatory options to buy AB Holding Units of $6.6 million. 
    
  Management believes that AB Holding will have the resources it needs to meet its financial obligations as a result of the cash flow AB Holding realizes from its investment in AB.

CAUTIONS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
    
  Certain statements provided by management in this report and in the portion of AB s Form 10-Q attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 are  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The most significant of these factors include, but are not limited to, the following: the performance of financial markets, the investment performance of sponsored investment products and separately-managed accounts, general economic conditions, industry trends, future acquisitions, integration of acquired companies, competitive conditions and government regulations, including changes in tax regulations and rates and the manner in which the earnings of publicly-traded partnerships are taxed. We caution readers to carefully consider such factors. Further, these forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made; we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements. For further information regarding these forward-looking statements and the factors that could cause actual results to differ,     see  Risk Factors  in Part I, Item 1A   of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015   and Part II, Item 1A     in this Form 10-Q. Any or all of the forward-looking statements that we make in our Form 10-K, this Form 10-Q, other documents we file with or furnish to the SEC, and any other public statements we issue, may turn out to be wrong. It is important to remember that other factors besides   those listed in  Risk Factors  and those listed below   also could affect adversely our revenues, financial condition, results of operations and business prospects. 
    
  The forward-looking statements referred to in   the preceding paragraph  , most of which directly affect AB but also affect AB Holding because AB Holding s principal source of income and cash flow is attributable to its investment in AB, include statements regarding: 

Our belief that the cash flow AB Holding realizes from its investment in AB will provide AB Holding with the resources it needs to meet its financial obligations:   AB Holding s cash flow is dependent on the quarterly cash distributions it receives from AB. Accordingly, AB Holding s ability to meet its financial obligations is dependent on AB s cash flow from its operations, which is subject to the performance of the capital markets and other factors beyond our control. 

Our financial condition and ability to access the public and private capital markets providing adequate liquidity for our general business needs:   Our financial condition is dependent on our cash flow from operations, which is subject to the performance of the capital markets, our ability to maintain and grow client assets under management and other factors beyond our control. Our ability to access public and private capital markets on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions, our firm s credit ratings, our profitability and changes in government regulations, including tax rates and interest rates. 

The outcome of litigation:   Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and excessive damage awards do occur. Though we have stated that we do not expect certain pending legal proceedings to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, any settlement or judgment with respect to a pending or future legal proceeding could be significant, and could have such an effect. 

The possibility that we will engage in open market purchases of AB Holding Units to help fund anticipated obligations under our incentive compensation award program:   The number of AB Holding Units AB may decide to buy in future periods, if any, to help fund incentive compensation awards depends on various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the fluctuation in the price of an AB Holding Unit (NYSE: AB) and the availability of cash to make these purchases. 

Our determination that adjusted employee compensation expense should not exceed 50% of our adjusted net revenues:    Aggregate employee compensation reflects employee performance and competitive compensation levels.  Fluctuations in our revenues and/or changes in competitive compensation levels could result in adjusted employee compensation expense exceeding 50% of our adjusted net revenues. 
                
    Our expectation that, as a result of repatriating future non-U.S. earnings, effective January 1, 2017, our effective tax rate will increase:   Our effective tax rate fluctuates based on the mix of our earnings across our tax filing group, which includes our U.S. partnership, our U.S. corporate subsidiaries and our corporate subsidiaries operating in various non-U.S. jurisdictions, and the differences between the tax rates in the U.S and the other jurisdictions where we conduct business.  

Item 3.      Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  There have been no material changes in AB Holding s market risk from the information provided under    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    in Part II, Item 7A of AB Holding's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures 
       
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Each of AB Holding and AB maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and the Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), to permit timely decisions regarding our disclosure. 
    
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the CEO and the CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the CEO and the CFO concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  No change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the   third   quarter of   2016   that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

  Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act  
    
    AB, AB Holding and their global subsidiaries had no transactions or activities requiring disclosure under the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act ( Iran Act ), nor were they involved in the AXA Group matters   described immediately below  . 
    
  The non-U.S. based subsidiaries of AXA operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations of the various jurisdictions in which they operate, including applicable international (United Nations and European Union) laws and regulations. While AXA Group companies based and operating outside the United States generally are not subject to U.S. law, as an international group, AXA has in place policies and standards (including the AXA Group International Sanctions Policy) that apply to all AXA Group companies worldwide and often impose requirements that go well beyond local law. For additional information regarding AXA,   see Note 1 to the condensed financial statements in Part 1, Item 1  . 
    
  AXA has informed us that AXA Konzern AG, an AXA insurance subsidiary organized under the laws of Germany, provides car insurance to diplomats based at the Iranian embassy in Berlin, Germany.  The total annual premium of these policies is approximately $13,000 and the annual net profit arising from these policies, which is difficult to calculate with precision, is estimated to be $1,950.  These policies were underwritten by a broker who specializes in providing insurance coverage for diplomats. Provision of motor vehicle insurance is mandatory in Germany and cannot be cancelled until the policies expire. 
    
  In addition, AXA has informed us that AXA Insurance Ireland, an AXA insurance subsidiary, provides statutorily required car insurance under four separate policies to the Iranian embassy in Dublin, Ireland. AXA has informed us that compliance with the Declined Cases Agreement of the Irish Government prohibits the cancellation of these policies unless another insurer is willing to assume the coverage. The total annual premium for these policies is  
  
   16 

     Index  

approximately $6,094 and the annual net profit arising from these policies, which is difficult to calculate with precision, is estimated to be $914. 
    
  Also, AXA has informed us that AXA Sigorta, a subsidiary of AXA organized under the laws of Turkey, provides car insurance coverage for vehicle pools of the Iranian General Consulate and the Iranian embassy in Istanbul, Turkey. Motor liability insurance coverage is mandatory in Turkey and cannot be cancelled unilaterally. The total annual premium in respect of these policies is approximately $3,150 and the annual net profit, which is difficult to calculate with precision, is estimated to be $473. 
    
  AXA has informed us that AXA Ukraine, an AXA insurance subsidiary, provides car insurance for the Attach  of the Embassy of Iran in Ukraine. Motor liability insurance coverage cannot be cancelled under Ukrainian law. The total annual premium in respect of this policy is approximately $1,000 and the annual net profit, which is difficult to calculate with precision, is estimated to be $150. 
    
  Lastly, AXA has informed us that AXA France, an AXA insurance subsidiary, has identified a property insurance contract for Bank Sepah in Paris, France.  This business commenced in July 2016 for a total annual premium of approximately $1,400 and the annual net profit arising from this policy, which is difficult to calculate with precision, is estimated to be $210.  
    
  The aggregate annual premium for the above-referenced insurance policies is approximately $24,644, representing approximately 0.00002% of AXA s 2015 consolidated revenues, which exceed $100 billion. The related net profit, which is difficult to calculate with precision, is estimated to be $3,697, representing approximately 0.00005% of AXA s 2015 aggregate net profit. 
    
  W.P. Stewart 
    
  On December 12, 2013, we acquired W.P. Stewart   Co., Ltd. ( WPS ), an equity investment manager that managed, as of December 12, 2013, approximately $2.1 billion in U.S., Global, and Europe, Australasia (Australia and New Zealand) and Far East ( EAFE ) concentrated growth equity strategies for its clients, primarily in the U.S. and Europe. On the date of the WPS acquisition, each of approximately 4.9 million outstanding shares of WPS common stock (other than certain specified shares, as previously disclosed in Amendment No. 2 to Form S-4 filed by AB on November 8, 2013) was converted into the right to receive $12.00 per share and one transferable contingent value right ( CVR ) entitling the holders to an additional $4.00 per share cash payment if the Assets Under Management (as such term is defined in the Contingent Value Rights Agreement ( CVR Agreement ) dated as of December 12, 2013, a copy of which we filed as Exhibit 4.01 ( Exhibit 4.01 ) to our December 31, 2013 Form 10-K) in the acquired WPS investment services business exceed $5 billion on or before December 12, 2016, subject to measurement procedures and limitations set forth in the CVR Agreement.   See the definition of AUM Milestone in Exhibit 4.01   for additional information regarding the circumstances that trigger payment pursuant to the CVRs. The foregoing description of the CVR Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the CVR Agreement. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Assets Under Management are approximately $4.4 billion. Accordingly, management has determined that the AUM Milestone did not occur during the   third   quarter of   2016  .

Organization  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , AXA, a   soci t  anonyme   organized under the laws of France and the holding company for the AXA Group, a worldwide leader in financial protection, through certain of its subsidiaries ( AXA and its subsidiaries ), owns approximately   1.5%   of the issued and outstanding units representing assignments of beneficial ownership of limited partnership interests in AllianceBernstein Holding L.P. ( AB Holding Units ).  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the ownership structure of AB, expressed as a percentage of general and limited partnership interests, is as follows:  

AllianceBernstein Corporation (an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of AXA,  General Partner ) is the general partner of both AllianceBernstein Holding L.P. ( AB Holding ) and AB. AllianceBernstein Corporation owns   100,000   general partnership units in AB Holding and a   1%   general partnership interest in AB. Including both the general partnership and limited partnership interests in AB Holding and AB, AXA and its subsidiaries had an approximate   64.2%   economic interest in AB as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Basis of Presentation  
    
  The interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the interim results, have been made. The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the interim reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The condensed consolidated statement of financial condition as of   December 31, 2015   was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).  
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements include AB and its majority-owned and/or controlled subsidiaries, and the consolidated entities that are considered to be variable interest entities ("VIEs") and for which AB is considered the primary beneficiary. Non-controlling interests on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition includes the portion of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds in which we do not have direct equity ownership. All significant inter-company transactions and balances among the consolidated entities have been eliminated.  
    
  Revision 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, management determined that the frequency with which we settle our U.S. inter-company payable balances with foreign subsidiaries over the past several years created deemed dividends under Section 956 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Section 956"). In the past, we funded our foreign subsidiaries as they required cash for their operations rather than pre-fund them each quarter, thereby reducing the inter-company balance to zero on a quarterly basis, as required by Section 956. As a result, we have been understating our income tax provision and income tax liability since 2010. We evaluated the aggregate effects of this error in our income tax provision and income tax liability to our previously issued financial statements in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins No. 99 and No. 108 and, based upon quantitative and qualitative factors, have determined that the error was not material to our previously issued financial statements. However, the cumulative effect of this error would be material to our third quarter 2016 financial results if recorded as an out-of-period adjustment in the third quarter of 2016. Accordingly, we have revised our previously issued financial statements that are included in this Form 10-Q. 
    
  In regard to our revision to correct previously issued financial statements, we recorded a cumulative adjustment to our January 1, 2012 partners' capital account and revised our consolidated statements of financial condition and consolidated statements of income from 2012 through the second quarter of 2016. As a result, we have established an income tax liability, including  
  
   8 

     Index  

interest and potential penalties, of   $45.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . As of   December 31, 2015  , the cumulative impact of the revision on partners  capital in the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition was   $37.7 million  . We revised our income tax provision, net income attributable to AB Unitholders, and basic and diluted net income per AB Unit reported in prior periods in the condensed consolidated statements of income. The tables below reflect the revisions to these line items for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015 presented in this Form 10-Q, as well as the six months ended June 30, 2016, which impacted the financial results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Other periods that have been revised, including the three months ended June 30, 2016, will appear in our future annual and quarterly filings. 

We provide income taxes on the undistributed earnings of non-U.S. corporate subsidiaries except to the extent that such earnings are permanently invested outside the United States. As a result of the deemed dividend adjustment discussed above, the accumulated undistributed earnings of non-U.S. corporate subsidiaries permanently invested outside the U.S. of   $892.0 million   as of   December 31, 2015   will decrease significantly as of   December 31, 2016  .  

2.    
    Significant Accounting Policies    
       
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements  
    
  In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-02,   Consolidation   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   ("ASU 2015-02"), which provides a new consolidation standard for evaluating: (i) limited partnerships and similar entities for consolidation, (ii) how decision maker or service provider fees affect the consolidation analysis, (iii) how interest held by related parties affect the consolidation analysis and (iv) how the consolidation analysis applies to certain investment funds. We adopted ASU 2015-02 using the modified retrospective method with an effective adoption date of January 1, 2016, which did not require the restatement of prior-year periods. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 resulted in the consolidation of certain investment funds that were not previously consolidated. These funds became consolidated VIEs because we are considered the party with both (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of  
  
   9 

     Index  

the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.   See Consolidation of VIEs below  . 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.   This standard requires debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability, consistent with the presentation of a debt discount. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2016 on a retrospective basis, which required the restatement of prior periods. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.   
    
  In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07,   Fair Value Measurement : Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)  . This standard removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value ("NAV") per share practical expedient. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2016 on a retrospective basis, which required the restatement of prior-period disclosures. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted  
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . The amendment is effective retrospectively for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2017. Management currently is evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. We expect to have this evaluation completed in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  . The amendment addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments  and is effective for fiscal years (and interim periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendment will result in a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption, except for one provision relating to equity securities without readily determinable fair values, which provision will be applied prospectively. The amendment is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  . The amendment requires recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the statement of financial condition and disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. Specifically, this guidance requires an operating lease lessee to recognize on the statement of financial condition a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. However, for leases with a term of twelve months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities.  The amendment is effective for fiscal years (and interim periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2018 and requires lessees to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements using a modified retrospective approach. Management currently is evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07,   Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting  . The amendment eliminates the current requirement for a retroactive adjustment and instead requires that the investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor's previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. Additionally, the amendment requires that an entity that has an available-for-sale equity security that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting recognize through earnings the unrealized holding gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for use of the equity method. The amendment is effective for fiscal years (and interim periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2016 and should be applied prospectively as of the effective date of increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that result in the adoption of the equity method. The amendment is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.  
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . The amendment includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements, including income tax effects of share-based payments, minimum statutory tax withholding requirements and forfeitures. The amendment is effective for fiscal years (and interim periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2016 and may be applied using various transition approaches (prospective, retrospective and modified retrospective). The amendment is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.  

10 

     Index  

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)  . The amendment is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendment is effective for fiscal years (and interim periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2017 and should be applied using a retrospective transition method. The amendment is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results or operations.  
    
  Consolidation of VIEs 
  As discussed above  , we adopted ASU 2015-02 effective January 1, 2016. 
  For legal entities evaluated for consolidation, we first determine whether the fees we receive and the interests we hold qualify as a variable interest in the entity, including an evaluation of fees paid to us as a decision maker or service provider to the entity being evaluated. Fees received by us are not variable interests if (i) the fees are compensation for services provided and are commensurate with the level of effort required to provide those services, (ii) the service arrangement includes only terms, conditions or amounts that are customarily present in arrangements for similar services negotiated at arm s length, and (iii) our other economic interests in the entity held directly and indirectly through our related parties, as well as economic interests held by related parties under common control, would not absorb more than an insignificant amount of the entity s losses or receive more than an insignificant amount of the entity s benefits. 
  For those entities in which we have a variable interest, we perform an analysis to determine whether the entity is a VIE by considering whether the entity s equity investment at risk is insufficient, whether the investors lack decision making rights proportional to their ownership percentage of the entity, and whether the investors lack the obligation to absorb an entity s expected losses or the right to receive an entity s expected income. 
  A VIE must be consolidated by its primary beneficiary, which generally is defined as the party that has a controlling financial interest in the VIE. We are deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a VIE if we have (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the VIE's economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive income from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. For purposes of evaluating (ii) above, fees paid to us as a decision maker or service provider are excluded if the fees are compensation for services provided commensurate with the level of effort required to be performed and the arrangement includes only customary terms, conditions or amounts present in arrangements for similar services negotiated at arm s length. The primary beneficiary evaluation generally is performed qualitatively based on all facts and circumstances, as well as quantitatively, as appropriate. 
  If we have a variable interest in an entity that is determined not to be a VIE, the entity is then evaluated for consolidation under the voting interest entity ( VOE ) model. For limited partnerships and similar entities, we are deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a VOE, and would be required to consolidate the entity, if we own a majority of the entity s kick-out rights through voting limited partnership interests and limited partners do not hold substantive participating rights (or other rights that would indicate that we do not control the entity). For entities other than limited partnerships, we are deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a VOE if we own a majority voting interest in the entity. 
  The analysis performed regarding the determination of variable interests held, whether entities are VIEs or VOEs, and whether we have a controlling financial interest in such entities requires the exercise of judgment. The analysis is updated continuously as circumstances change or new entities are formed. 
  As a result of the adoption of ASU 2015-02, effective January 1, 2016, we consolidated   three   investment funds that were classified as VIEs in which we have a controlling financial interest. Ownership interests not held by us relating to these consolidated VIEs are included in redeemable non-controlling interest on the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition. In addition, effective January 1, 2016, we reclassified our consolidated private equity fund as a consolidated VIE, which had been consolidated as of   December 31, 2015   under previous accounting guidance due to our controlling financial interest of a VOE. Ownership interests not held by us relating to this consolidated VIE, which is a closed-end fund, are included in non-controlling interest on the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition.  
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , subsequent to the initial adoption of ASU 2015-02, we consolidated   two   additional investment funds that were classified as VIEs in which we have a controlling interest and deconsolidated a VIE of which we were no longer the primary beneficiary. The table below illustrates the summary balance sheet amounts related to these VIEs at their consolidation dates:  
  
   11 

     Index  

As of   September 30, 2016  , the net assets of company-sponsored investment products that are non-consolidated VIEs are approximately   $43.0 billion  , and our maximum risk of loss is our investment of   $11.6 million   in these VIEs and advisory fee receivables from these VIEs, which are not material. 
   
           3. 
    Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans    
       
  We maintain several unfunded, non-qualified long-term incentive compensation plans, under which we grant annual awards to employees, generally in the fourth quarter, and to members of the Board of Directors, who are not employed by us or any of our affiliates ("Eligible Directors").  
    
  We fund our restricted AB Holding Unit awards either by purchasing AB Holding Units on the open market or purchasing newly-issued AB Holding Units from AB Holding, and then keeping all of these AB Holding Units in a consolidated rabbi trust until delivering them or retiring them. In accordance with the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of AB ( AB Partnership Agreement ), when AB purchases newly-issued AB Holding Units from AB Holding, AB Holding is required to use the proceeds it receives from AB to purchase the equivalent number of newly-issued AB Units, thus increasing its percentage ownership interest in AB. AB Holding Units held in the consolidated rabbi trust are corporate assets in the name of the trust and are available to the general creditors of AB.  
    
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we purchased   2.0 million   and   5.8 million   AB Holding Units for   $45.2 million   and   $129.2 million  , respectively (on a trade date basis). These amounts reflect open-market purchases of   2.0 million   and   5.7 million   AB Holding Units for   $45.1 million   and   $127.1 million  , respectively, with the remainder relating to purchases of AB Holding Units from employees to allow them to fulfill statutory tax withholding requirements at the time of delivery of long-term incentive compensation awards. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we purchased   3.0 million   and   3.8 million   AB Holding Units for   $82.1 million   and   $103.4 million  , respectively (on a trade date basis). These amounts reflected open-market purchases of   3.0 million   and   3.7 million   AB Holding Units for   $82.1 million   and   $101.1 million  , respectively, with the remainder relating to purchases of AB Holding Units from employees to allow them to fulfill statutory tax withholding requirements at the time of delivery of long-term incentive compensation awards. Purchases of AB Holding Units reflected on the consolidated statements of cash flows are net of AB Holding Unit purchases by employees as part of a distribution reinvestment election. 
    
  Each quarter, we implement plans to repurchase AB Holding Units pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act ). A Rule 10b5-1 plan allows a company to repurchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so because of self-imposed trading blackout periods or because it possesses material non-public information. Each broker we select has the authority under the terms and limitations specified in the plan to repurchase AB Holding Units on our behalf in accordance with the terms of the plan. Repurchases are subject to regulations promulgated by the SEC as well as certain price, market volume and timing constraints specified in the plan. The plan adopted during the   third   quarter of   2016   expired at the close of business on October 25, 2016. We may adopt additional Rule 10b5-1 plans in the future to engage in open-market purchases of AB Holding Units to help fund anticipated obligations under our incentive compensation award program and for other corporate purposes.

     Index  

During the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , we granted to employees and Eligible Directors   0.7 million   and   0.3 million   restricted AB Holding Unit awards, respectively. We used AB Holding Units repurchased during the period and newly-issued AB Holding Units to fund these awards.  
    
  During the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , AB Holding issued   0.1 million   and   0.5 million   AB Holding Units, respectively, upon exercise of options to buy AB Holding Units. AB Holding used the proceeds of   $2.4 million   and   $9.0 million  , respectively, received from employees as payment in cash for the exercise price to purchase the equivalent number of newly-issued AB Units.  

4. 
    Cash Distributions    
       
  AB is required to distribute all of its Available Cash Flow, as defined in the AB Partnership Agreement, to its Unitholders and to the General Partner. Available Cash Flow can be summarized as the cash flow received by AB from operations minus such amounts as the General Partner determines, in its sole discretion, should be retained by AB for use in its business, or plus such amounts as the General Partner determines, in its sole discretion, should be released from previously retained cash flow.  
    
  Typically, Available Cash Flow has been the adjusted diluted net income per unit for the quarter multiplied by the number of general and limited partnership interests at the end of the quarter. In future periods, management anticipates that Available Cash Flow will be based on adjusted diluted net income per unit, unless management determines that one or more non-GAAP adjustments that are made for adjusted net income should not be made with respect to the Available Cash Flow calculation.  
    
  On   October 26, 2016  , the General Partner declared a distribution of   $0.51   per AB Unit, representing a distribution of Available Cash Flow for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The General Partner, as a result of its   1%   general partnership interest, is entitled to receive   1%   of each distribution. The distribution is payable on   November 17, 2016   to holders of record on   November 7, 2016  .

    Real Estate Charges    
       
  During 2010, we performed a comprehensive review of our real estate requirements in New York in connection with our workforce reductions, which commenced in 2008. As a result, during 2010 we decided to sub-lease over   380,000   square feet in New York (all of this space has been sublet) and consolidate our New York-based employees into   two   office locations from   three  . During the third quarter of 2012, in an effort to further reduce our global real estate footprint, we completed a comprehensive review of our worldwide office locations and began implementing a global space consolidation plan. As a result, we decided to sub-lease approximately   510,000   square feet of office space (all of this space has been sublet), more than   70%   of which is New York office space (in addition to the   380,000   square foot space reduction in 2010), with the remainder consisting of office space in England, Australia and various U.S. locations.  
    
  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , we recorded pre-tax real estate charges of   $24.6 million  , resulting from new charges of   $26.7 million   relating to the further consolidation of office space at our New York offices, offset by changes in estimates related to previously recorded real estate charges of   $2.1 million  . 
    
  The activity in the liability account relating to our 2010 and 2012 office space consolidation initiatives for the following periods is as follows: 

6.    
    Net Income per Unit    
       
  Basic net income per unit is derived by reducing net income for the   1%   general partnership interest and dividing the remaining   99%   by the basic weighted average number of units outstanding for each period. Diluted net income per unit is derived by reducing net income for the   1%   general partnership interest and dividing the remaining   99%   by the total of the diluted weighted average number of units outstanding for each period.  

For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we excluded   2,873,106   options from the diluted net income per unit computation due to their anti-dilutive effect. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we excluded

2,771,250   and   2,383,589   options, respectively, from the diluted net income per unit computation due to their anti-dilutive effect.  

7.    
    Cash and Securities Segregated Under Federal Regulations and Other Requirements    
       
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,     $0.4 billion   and   $0.5 billion  , respectively, of U.S. Treasury Bills were segregated in a special reserve bank custody account for the exclusive benefit of our brokerage customers under Rule 15c3-3 of the Exchange Act.  
    
  One of our subsidiaries, which serves as the distributor of our U.S. mutual funds, maintains several special bank accounts for the exclusive benefit of customers. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $47.5 million   and   $55.4 million  , respectively, of cash was segregated in these bank accounts.

Total investments related to long-term incentive compensation obligations of   $67.5 million   and   $78.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, consist of company-sponsored mutual funds and hedge funds. For long-term incentive compensation awards granted before 2009, we typically made investments in our services that were notionally elected by plan participants and maintained them (and continue to maintain them) in a consolidated rabbi trust or separate custodial account. The rabbi trust and custodial account enable us to hold such investments separate from our other assets for the purpose of settling our obligations to participants. The investments held in the rabbi trust and custodial account remain available to the general creditors of AB.  
    
  The underlying investments of the hedge funds in which we invest include long and short positions in equity securities, fixed income securities (including various agency and non-agency asset-based securities), currencies, commodities and derivatives (including various swaps and forward contracts). These investments are valued at quoted market prices or, where quoted market prices are not available, are fair valued based on the pricing policies and procedures of the underlying funds.  
    
  U.S. Treasury Bills, the majority of which are pledged as collateral with clearing organizations, are held in our investment account. These clearing organizations have the ability by contract or custom to sell or re-pledge this collateral.

We allocate seed capital to our investment teams to help develop new products and services for our clients. The seed capital trading investments are equity and fixed income products, primarily in the form of separately-managed account portfolios, U.S. mutual funds, Luxembourg funds, Japanese investment trust management funds or Delaware business trusts. We also may allocate seed capital to investments in private equity funds, such as our consolidated venture capital fund, which holds technology, media, telecommunications, healthcare and clean-tech investments, and a third-party venture capital fund that invests in communications, consumer, digital media, healthcare and information technology markets. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our seed capital investments were   $401.0 million   and   $478.0 million  , respectively.  
    
  Our consolidated venture capital fund, previously consolidated under the voting interest entity model, is considered a consolidated VIE effective January 1, 2016 upon the adoption of ASU 2015-02. 
    
  Trading securities also include long positions in corporate equities, an exchange-traded fund and long exchange-traded options traded through our options desk.

    Derivative Instruments    
       
  We enter into various futures, forwards, options and swaps to economically hedge certain seed capital investments.  Also, we have currency forwards that economically hedge certain balance sheet exposures. In addition, our options desk trades long and short exchange-traded equity options. We do not hold any derivatives designated in a formal hedge relationship under Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 815-10,   Derivatives and Hedging  .

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the derivative assets and liabilities are included in both receivables and payables to brokers and dealers on our condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.  
    
  The gains and losses for derivative instruments (excluding our options desk trading activities) for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   recognized in investment gains (losses) in the condensed consolidated statements of income were as follows:  

We may be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative financial instruments. We minimize our counterparty exposure through a credit review and approval process. In addition, we have executed various collateral arrangements with counterparties to the over-the-counter derivative transactions that require both pledging and accepting collateral in the form of cash. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we held   $0.8 million   and   $1.5 million  , respectively, of cash collateral payable to trade counterparties. This obligation to return cash is reported in payables to brokers and dealers in our condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.  
    
  Although notional amount is the most commonly used measure of volume in the derivative market, it is not used as a measure of credit risk. Generally, the current credit exposure of our derivative contracts is limited to the net positive estimated fair value of derivative contracts at the reporting date after taking into consideration the existence of netting agreements and any collateral received. A derivative with positive value (a derivative asset) indicates existence of credit risk because the counterparty would owe us if the contract were closed. Alternatively, a derivative contract with negative value (a derivative  
  
   17 

     Index  

liability) indicates we would owe money to the counterparty if the contract were closed. Generally, if there is more than one derivative transaction with a single counterparty, a master netting arrangement exists with respect to derivative transactions with that counterparty to provide for aggregate net settlement.  
    
  Certain of our standardized contracts for over-the-counter derivative transactions ( ISDA Master Agreements ) contain credit risk related contingent provisions pertaining to each counterparty s credit rating. In some ISDA Master Agreements, if the counterparty s credit rating, or in some agreements, our assets under management ( AUM ), falls below a specified threshold, either a default or a termination event permitting the counterparty to terminate the ISDA Master Agreement would be triggered. In all agreements that provide for collateralization, various levels of collateralization of net liability positions are applicable, depending on the credit rating of the counterparty. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we delivered   $5.1 million   and   $12.8 million  , respectively, of cash collateral into brokerage accounts. We report this cash collateral in cash and cash equivalents in our condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we held   $3.5 million   and   $5.9 million  , respectively, of long exchange-traded equity options, which are classified as trading investments and included in other investments on our condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. In addition, as of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we held   $4.3 million   and   $0.8 million  , respectively, of short exchange-traded equity options, which are included in securities sold not yet purchased on our condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. Our options desk provides our clients with equity derivative strategies and execution for exchange-traded options on single stocks, exchange-traded funds and indices. While predominately agency-based, the options desk may commit capital to facilitate a client s transaction. Our options desk hedges the risks associated with this activity by taking offsetting positions in equities. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized   $10.9 million   and   $27.6 million  , respectively, of losses on equity options activity. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recognized   $14.1 million   and   $54.5 million  , respectively, of losses on equity options activity. These losses are recognized in investment gains (losses) in the condensed consolidated statements of income.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our consolidated VIEs held   $0.3 million   (net) of futures, forwards and swaps within their portfolios. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized   $2.0 million   of losses and   $0.7 million   of gains, respectively, on these derivative positions. These gains are recognized in investment gains (losses) in the condensed consolidated statements of income. As of   September 30, 2016  , the consolidated VIEs held   $0.4 million   of cash collateral payable to trade counterparties. This obligation to return cash is reported in the liabilities of consolidated VIEs in our condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. As of   September 30, 2016  , the consolidated VIEs delivered   $3.0 million   of cash collateral into brokerage accounts.

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (  i.e.  , the  exit price ) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The three broad levels of fair value hierarchy are as follows:  
    
       Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets are available for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date.  

Level 2   Quoted prices in markets that are not active or other pricing inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date.  

Level 3    Prices or valuation techniques that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable as of the reported date. These financial instruments do not have two-way markets and are measured using management s best estimate of fair value, where the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation.  
            Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

Included in Note 8, Investments,   but excluded in the above fair value table, are the following investments: 
       Limited partnership hedge funds, which are recorded using the equity method of accounting; 
              
    Other investments, which primarily include miscellaneous investments recorded using the cost or equity method of accounting and long-term deposits; and 
        
  We   provide below   a description of the fair value methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy:  

Money markets  : We invest excess cash in various money market funds that are valued based on quoted prices in active  markets; these are included in Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.  

Treasury Bills  : We hold U.S. Treasury Bills, which are primarily segregated in a special reserve bank custody account as required by Rule 15c3-3 of the Exchange Act. These securities are valued based on quoted yields in secondary markets and are included in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.  

Equity and fixed income securities  : Our equity and fixed income securities consist principally of company-sponsored mutual funds with NAVs and various separately-managed portfolios consisting primarily of equity and fixed income securities with quoted prices in active markets, which are included in Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. In addition, some securities are valued based on observable inputs from recognized pricing vendors, which are included in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.  

Derivatives  : We hold exchange-traded futures with counterparties that are included in Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. In addition, we also hold currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps, credit default swaps, option swaps and total return swaps with counterparties that are valued based on observable inputs from recognized pricing vendors, which are included in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.  
       
         Options  : We hold long exchange-traded options that are included in Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.  

Private equity  : As of December 31, 2015, private equity investments include the investments of our consolidated venture capital fund and our investment in a private equity energy fund. As of   September 30, 2016  , the consolidated venture capital fund is classified as a consolidated VIE (  see Note 2  ) and is discussed separately below; our investment in a private equity energy fund remains. Generally, the valuation of private equity investments requires significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such investments. Private equity investments are valued initially at cost. The carrying values of private equity investments are adjusted either up or down from cost to reflect expected exit values as evidenced by financing and sale transactions with third parties, or when determination of a valuation adjustment is confirmed through ongoing review in accordance with our valuation policies and procedures. A variety of factors are reviewed and monitored to assess positive and negative changes in valuation, including current operating performance and future expectations of investee companies, industry valuations of comparable public companies, changes in market outlooks, and the third party financing environment over time. In determining valuation adjustments resulting from the investment review process, particular emphasis is placed on current company performance and market conditions. For these reasons, which make the fair value of private equity investments unobservable, equity investments are included in Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. If private equity investments become publicly traded, they are included in Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy; provided, however, if they contain trading restrictions, publicly-traded equity investments are included in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy until the trading restrictions expire.  

Securities sold not yet purchased  : Securities sold not yet purchased, primarily reflecting short positions in equities and exchange-traded options, are included in Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.  

Contingent payment arrangements  : Contingent payment arrangements relate to contingent payment liabilities associated with acquisitions in 2010, 2013, 2014 and 2016. At each reporting date, we estimate the fair values of the contingent  
     
   22 

     Index  

consideration expected to be paid based upon probability-weighted AUM and revenue projections, using unobservable market data inputs, which are included in Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.  
             
    Consolidated VIEs  : During the third quarter of 2016, we deconsolidated a VIE that was consolidated during the first six months of 2016 and consolidated   two   new VIEs. Currently,   four   of our consolidated VIEs are open-end Luxembourg funds investing in (i) high yield debt issued by U.S. corporations and related derivatives, (ii) fixed income securities issued by Asia-Pacific issuers and related derivatives, and (iii) equity securities, including common and preferred stocks, convertible securities, depositary receipts and securities of real estate investment trusts; currencies and currency-related instruments; pooled investment vehicles; and financial derivative instruments, such as options, futures, forwards, swaps and commodity index-related instruments. In addition, our venture capital fund, which is classified as a consolidated VIE effective January 1, 2016, holds both private equity investments as well as private equity investments that became publicly-traded. The investments and derivatives held by the consolidated VIEs are included in Levels 1, 2 and 3 of the valuation hierarchy. If private equity investments become publicly traded, they are included in Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy; provided, however, if they contain trading restrictions, publicly-traded equity investments are included in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy until the trading restrictions expire. During the third quarter of 2016,   one   of our private securities went public and, due to a trading restriction period,   $23.6 million   was transferred from a Level 3 to a Level 2 classification. 
       
  The change in carrying value associated with Level 3 financial instruments carried at fair value, classified as private equity investments, trading equity securities and investments held by our consolidated VIEs, is as follows:  

Transfers into and out of all levels of the fair value hierarchy are reflected at end-of-period fair values. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on Level 3 financial instruments are recorded in investment gains and losses in the condensed consolidated statements of income.  
  Also, as of   September 30, 2016  , our   three   consolidated VIEs that are open-end Luxembourg funds hold   $2.8 million   of investments that are classified as Level 3. They primarily consist of corporate bonds that are vendor priced with no ratings available, bank loans, non-agency collateralized mortgage obligations and asset-backed securities. The remainder of the activity related to consolidated VIEs pertains to our consolidated venture capital fund. 
  In addition, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we have an investment in a private equity fund focused exclusively on the energy sector (fair value of   $4.8 million   and   $6.5 million  , respectively) that is classified as Level 3. This investment s valuation is based on a market approach, considering recent transactions in the fund and the industry.

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the reporting entities  venture capital securities in the Technology, Media and Telecommunications areas are enterprise value to revenue multiples and a discount to account for liquidity and various risk factors. Significant increases (decreases) in the enterprise value to revenue multiple inputs in isolation would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. Significant increases (decreases) in the discount would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. 
  The change in carrying value associated with Level 3 financial instruments carried at fair value, classified as contingent payment arrangements, is as follows:  

During the third quarter of 2016, we recorded a change in estimate of the contingent consideration payable relating to our 2010 acquisition of   $2.2 million  . Additionally, we had recorded a contingent consideration payable for our 2013 acquisition relating to contingent value rights ("CVRs"). The CVRs would have entitled the shareholders to an additional   $4   per share if the assets under management in the acquired investment services exceed   $5 billion   on or before the third anniversary of the acquisition date. As of September 30, 2016, management has determined the target will probably not be met and, as a result, reversed the contingent consideration payable of   $19.3 million  . 
    
  As of September 30, 2016, the   three   acquisition-related contingent consideration liabilities recorded have a combined fair value of   $18.0 million   and are valued using a projected AUM weighted average growth rate of   18%   for one acquisition, and revenue growth rates and discount rates ranging from   4%   to   31%   and   1.4%   to   6.4%  , respectively, for the three acquisitions. 
    
  As of December 31, 2015, the   three   acquisition-related contingent consideration liabilities recorded had a combined fair value of   $31.4 million   and were valued using a projected AUM weighted average growth rate of   46%  , a revenue growth rate of   43%  , and discount rates ranging  from   3.0%   to   6.4%  .  
    
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis  
    
  We did not have any material assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value for impairment on a nonrecurring basis during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or during the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

  With respect to all significant litigation matters, we consider the likelihood of a negative outcome.  If we determine the likelihood of a negative outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record an estimated loss for the expected outcome of the litigation. If the likelihood of a negative outcome is reasonably possible and we are able to determine an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts already accrued, if any, we disclose that fact together with the estimate of the possible loss or range of loss. However, it is often difficult to predict the outcome or estimate a possible loss or range of loss because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, particularly when plaintiffs allege substantial or indeterminate damages. Such is also the case when the litigation is in its early stages or when the litigation is highly complex or broad in scope. In these cases, we disclose that we are unable to predict the outcome or estimate a possible loss or range of loss.  
    
  During the first quarter of 2012, we received a legal letter of claim ( Letter of Claim ) sent on behalf of Philips Pension Trustees Limited and Philips Electronics U.K. Limited ( Philips ), a former pension fund client, alleging that AllianceBernstein Limited (one of our subsidiaries organized in the U.K.) was negligent and failed to meet certain applicable standards of care with respect to the initial investment in, and management of, a    500 million   portfolio of U.S. mortgage-backed securities. Philips has alleged damages ranging between   $177 million   and   $234 million  , plus compound interest on an alleged   $125 million   of realized losses in the portfolio. On January 2, 2014, Philips filed a claim form ( Claim ) in the High Court of Justice in London, England, which formally commenced litigation with respect to the allegations in the Letter of Claim.  
    
  We believe that any losses to Philips resulted from adverse developments in the U.S. housing and mortgage market that precipitated the financial crisis in 2008 and not from any negligence or other failure or malfeasance on our part. We believe that we have strong defenses to these claims, which are set forth in our October 12, 2012 response to the Letter of Claim and our June 27, 2014 Statement of Defence in response to the Claim, and intend to defend this matter vigorously. 
    
  In addition to the Claim   discussed immediately above  , we are involved in various other matters, including regulatory inquiries, administrative proceedings and litigation, some of which allege significant damages.  
    
  In management s opinion, an adequate accrual has been made as of   September 30, 2016   to provide for any probable losses regarding any litigation matters for which we can reasonably estimate an amount of loss. It is reasonably possible that we could incur additional losses pertaining to these matters, but currently we cannot estimate any such additional losses.  
    
  Management, after consultation with legal counsel, currently believes that the outcome of any individual matter that is pending or threatened, or all of them combined, will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. However, any inquiry, proceeding or litigation has an element of uncertainty; management cannot determine whether further developments relating to any individual matter that is pending or threatened, or all of them combined, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition or liquidity in any future reporting period.

  On September 23, 2016, we acquired Ramius Alternative Solutions LLC ("RASL"), a global alternative investment management business that, as of the acquisition date, had approximately   $2.5 billion   in AUM. RASL offers a range of customized alternative investment and advisory solutions to a global institutional client base. On the acquisition date, we made a cash payment of   $20.5 million   and recorded a contingent consideration payable of   $11.9 million  . The valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired has been determined provisionally. The excess of the purchase price over the current fair value of identifiable net assets acquired resulted in the recognition of   $31.9 million   of goodwill as of September 30, 2016. Adjustments, if any, will be recorded to goodwill upon the completion of the valuation during the fourth quarter of 2016.

Item 2.       Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  Executive Overview 
  Our total assets under management ( AUM ) as of September 30, 2016 were $490.2 billion, up $0.7 billion, or 0.1%, compared to June 30, 2016, and up $27.3 billion, or 5.9%, compared to September 30, 2015. During the third quarter of 2016, AUM increased as a result of market appreciation of $13.5 billion and new assets from our third quarter acquisition of Ramius Alternative Solutions LLC ($2.5 billion of AUM), offset by net outflows of $15.3 billion (primarily from the Institutions channel). During the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, AUM increased as a result of market appreciation of $40.0 billion, offset by net outflows of $12.2 billion.  
  Institutional AUM decreased $1.8 billion, or 0.7%, to $247.0 billion during the third quarter of 2016, due to net outflows of $9.9 billion, offset by market appreciation of $5.6 billion and $2.5 billion of new assets from our third quarter acquisition. Gross sales were flat compared to the second quarter of 2016. However, redemptions and terminations increased sequentially from $2.4 billion to $10.7 billion primarily as a result of an institutional alternative investment portfolio redemption (  see Third Quarter 2016 AUM Redemptions below  ). 
  Retail AUM increased $0.8 billion, or 0.5%, to $162.2 billion during the third quarter of 2016, primarily due to market appreciation of $5.7 billion, offset by net outflows of $5.0 billion. Gross sales increased 13.3% sequentially from $10.8 billion during the second quarter of 2016 to $12.3 billion during the third quarter of 2016. However, redemptions and terminations increased sequentially from $7.5 billion to $15.7 billion primarily as a result of the State of Rhode Island redemption (  see Third Quarter 2016 AUM Redemptions below  ).  
  Private Wealth Management AUM increased $1.7 billion, or 2.2%, to $81.0 billion during the third quarter of 2016, primarily due to market appreciation of $2.2 billion, offset by net outflows of $0.4 billion. Gross sales were flat compared to the second quarter of 2016. However, redemptions and terminations increased 25.6% sequentially from $2.1 billion during the second quarter of 2016 to $2.7 billion during the third quarter of 2016. 
  Bernstein Research Services revenue for the third quarter of 2016 was $110.9 million, down $16.2 million, or 12.7%, compared to the third quarter of 2015, as a result of a steep drop in market trading volumes across the U.S. and Europe. 
  Net revenues for the third quarter of 2016 increased $8.9 million, or 1.2%, to $747.6 million from $738.7 million in the third quarter of 2015. The drivers of the increase were higher investment gains of $27.9 million and higher base advisory fees of $2.7 million, offset by lower Bernstein Research Services revenue of $16.2 million and lower distribution revenues of $7.7 million. Operating expenses for the third quarter of 2016 decreased $34.4 million, or 5.8%, to $562.3 million from $596.7 million in the second quarter of 2015. The decrease primarily was due to lower contingent payment arrangements of $21.6 million and lower promotion and servicing expenses of $9.0 million. Our operating income increased $43.3 million, or 30.5%, to $185.3 million from $142.0 million in the third quarter of 2015 and our operating margin increased to 22.7% in the third quarter of 2016 from 19.6% in the third quarter of 2015. 
  Market Environment    
  U.S. equity markets rallied during the third quarter of 2016, but market volatility persisted. Various factors, including global social and political uncertainty, the U.S. presidential election, mixed economic data and the timing of the next U.S. interest rate increase, continued to dampen client sentiment and activity levels and caused investors to favor the perceived safety of passive investments.

Revision 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, management determined that the frequency with which we settle our U.S. inter-company payable balances with foreign subsidiaries over the past several years created deemed dividends under Section 956 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Section 956"). In the past, we funded our foreign subsidiaries as they required cash for their operations rather than pre-fund them each quarter, thereby reducing the inter-company balance to zero on a quarterly basis, as required by Section 956. As a result, we have been understating our income tax provision and income tax liability since 2010. In regard to our revision of previously issued financial statements, we recorded a cumulative adjustment to our January 1, 2012 partners' capital account and revised our consolidated statements of financial condition and consolidated statements of income from 2012 through the second quarter of 2016.  
    
  Real Estate Charges 
    
  During 2010, we performed a comprehensive review of our real estate requirements in New York in connection with our workforce reductions, which commenced in 2008. As a result, during 2010 we decided to sub-lease over 380,000 square feet in New York (all of this space has been sublet) and consolidate our New York-based employees into two office locations from three. During the third quarter of 2012, in an effort to further reduce our global real estate footprint, we completed a comprehensive review of our worldwide office locations and began implementing a global space consolidation plan. As a result, we decided to sub-lease approximately 510,000 square feet of office space (all of this space has been sublet), more than 70% of which is New York office  
  
   38 

     Index  

space (in addition to the 380,000 square foot space reduction in 2010), with the remainder consisting of office space in England, Australia and various U.S. locations. 
    
  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , we recorded pre-tax real estate charges of $24.6 million, resulting from new charges of $26.7 million relating to the further consolidation of office space at our New York offices, offset by changes in estimates related to previously recorded real estate charges of $2.1 million.  
    
  Units Outstanding 
    
  Each quarter, we implement plans to repurchase AB Holding Units pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act ). A Rule 10b5-1 plan allows a company to repurchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so because of self-imposed trading blackout periods or because it possesses material non-public information. Each broker we select has the authority under the terms and limitations specified in the plan to repurchase AB Holding Units on our behalf in accordance with the terms of the plan. Repurchases are subject to regulations promulgated by the SEC as well as certain price, market volume and timing constraints specified in the plan. The plan adopted during the   third   quarter of   2016   expired at the close of business on October 25, 2016. We may adopt additional Rule 10b5-1 plans in the future to engage in open-market purchases of AB Holding Units to help fund anticipated obligations under our incentive compensation award program and for other corporate purposes. 
    
  Cash Distributions 
    
  AB is required to distribute all of its Available Cash Flow, as defined in the AB Partnership Agreement, to its Unitholders and to the General Partner. Available Cash Flow typically is the adjusted diluted net income per unit for the quarter multiplied by the number of general and limited partnership interests at the end of the quarter. In future periods, management anticipates that Available Cash Flow will continue to be based on adjusted diluted net income per unit, unless management determines, with concurrence of the Board of Directors, that one or more non-GAAP adjustments that are made for adjusted net income should not be made with respect to the Available Cash Flow calculation.   See Note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained in Item 1   for a description of Available Cash Flow. 
  
   39 

     Index  

Management Operating Metrics 
    
  We are providing the non-GAAP measures  adjusted net revenues ,  adjusted operating income  and  adjusted operating margin  because they are the principal operating metrics management uses in evaluating and comparing period-to-period operating performance. Management principally uses these metrics in evaluating performance because they present a clearer picture of our operating performance and allow management to see long-term trends without the distortion primarily caused by long-term incentive compensation-related mark-to-market adjustments, real estate consolidation charges and other adjustment items. Similarly, we believe that these management operating metrics help investors better understand the underlying trends in our results and, accordingly, provide a valuable perspective for investors. 
    
  These non-GAAP measures are provided in addition to, and not as substitutes for, net revenues, operating income and operating margin, and they may not be comparable to non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. Management uses both  accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( US GAAP ) and non-GAAP measures in evaluating our financial performance. The non-GAAP measures alone may pose limitations because they do not include all of our revenues and expenses. 

Adjusted operating income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   increased $1.6 million, or 1.1%, from the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to lower employee compensation expense (excluding the impact of long-term incentive compensation-related items) of $8.8 million, lower promotion and servicing expense of $4.7 million, higher investment advisory  
  
   40 

     Index  

base fees of $3.6 million, higher investment gains of $3.3 million and lower general and administration expense (excluding real estate charges) of $1.6 million, offset by lower Bernstein Research Services revenue of $16.2 million and higher net distribution expenses of $4.3 million. Adjusted operating income for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased $41.4 million, or 9.1%, from the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  ,  primarily due to lower investment advisory base fees of $59.2 million, lower Bernstein Research Services revenue of $22.6 million, lower performance-based fees of $16.6 million, higher net distribution expenses of $9.3 million and higher investments losses of $3.4 million, offset by lower employee compensation expense (excluding the impact of long-term incentive compensation-related items) of $58.7 million and lower promotion and servicing expenses of $10.4 million.  
    
  Adjusted Net Revenues 
    
  Adjusted net revenues exclude investment gains and losses and dividends and interest on employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments. In addition, adjusted net revenues offset distribution-related payments to third parties as well as amortization of deferred sales commissions against distribution revenues. We believe offsetting net revenues by distribution-related payments is useful for our investors and other users of our financial statements because such presentation appropriately reflects the nature of these costs as pass-through payments to third parties who perform functions on behalf of our sponsored mutual funds and/or shareholders of these funds. We offset amortization of deferred sales commissions against net revenues because such costs, over time, essentially offset our distribution revenues. We also exclude additional pass-through expenses we incur (primarily through our transfer agency) that are reimbursed and recorded as fees in revenues. These fees do not affect operating income, but they do affect our operating margin. As such, we exclude these fees from adjusted net revenues. 
    
  Lastly, in 2015 we excluded 90% of the investment gains and losses of our consolidated venture capital fund attributable to non-controlling interests. Effective January 1, 2016, as a result of adopting a new accounting standard (  see Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements),   we account for     our consolidated venture capital fund in the same manner as our other consolidated VIEs. We adjust for the revenue impact of consolidating VIEs by eliminating the consolidated VIEs' revenues and including AB's fees from such VIEs and AB's investment gains and losses on its investments in such VIEs that were eliminated in consolidation. In addition, in the first quarter of 2016 we excluded a realized gain of $75.3 million resulting from the liquidation of an investment in Jasper Wireless Technologies, Inc. ("Jasper"), which was acquired by Cisco Systems, Inc., because it was not part of our core operating results.  
    
  Adjusted Operating Income 
    
  Adjusted operating income represents operating income on a US GAAP basis excluding (1) the impact on net revenues and compensation expense of the investment gains and losses (as well as the dividends and interest) associated with employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments, (2) the gain on the sale of our investment in Jasper, (3) real estate charges (credits), (4) acquisition-related expenses, (5) the net income or loss of consolidated entities attributable to non-controlling interests in 2015, (6) adjustments to contingent payment arrangements, and (7) the impact of consolidated VIEs in 2016. 
    
  Prior to 2009, a significant portion of employee compensation was in the form of employee long-term incentive compensation awards that were notionally invested in AB investment services and generally vested over a period of four years. AB economically hedged the exposure to market movements by purchasing and holding these investments on its balance sheet. All such investments had vested as of year-end 2012 and the investments have been distributed to the participants, except for those investments with respect to which the participant elected a long-term deferral. Fluctuation in the value of these investments is recorded within investment gains and losses on the income statement and also impacts compensation expense. Management believes it is useful to reflect the offset achieved from economically hedging the market exposure of these investments in the calculation of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin. The non-GAAP measures exclude gains and losses and dividends and interest on employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments included in revenues and compensation expense. 
    
  A realized gain on an investment carried at cost has been excluded due to its non-recurring nature and because it is not part of our core operating results.  
    
  Real estate charges (credits) have been excluded because they are not considered part of our core operating results when comparing financial results from period to period and to industry peers. 
    
  Acquisition-related expenses have been excluded because they are not considered part of our core operating results when comparing financial results from period to period and to industry peers.  
    
  The recording of changes in estimates of contingent consideration payable with respect to contingent payment arrangements associated with our acquisitions are not considered part of our core operating results and, accordingly, have been excluded. 
  
   41 

     Index  

In regard to 2015 adjusted operating income, most of the net income or loss of consolidated entities attributable to non-controlling interests relates to the 90% limited partner interests held by third parties in our consolidated venture capital fund. We own a 10% limited partner interest in the fund. US GAAP requires us to consolidate the financial results of the fund because we are the general partner and are deemed to have a controlling interest. However, recognizing 100% of the gains or losses in operating income while only retaining 10% is not reflective of our underlying financial results at the operating income level. As a result, we exclude the 90% limited partner interests we do not own from our adjusted operating income. Effective January 1, 2016, our consolidated venture capital fund is included with other consolidated VIEs. Similarly, net income of joint ventures attributable to non-controlling interests, although not significant, is excluded because it does not reflect the economic interest attributable to AB. 
    
  Relating to 2016 adjusted operating income, we adjusted for the operating income impact of consolidating certain VIEs (as a result of the adoption of a new accounting standard;   see Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements)   by eliminating the consolidated VIEs' revenues and expenses and including AB's revenues and expenses that were eliminated in consolidation. We also excluded the limited partner interests we do not own. 
    
  Adjusted Operating Margin 
    
  Adjusted operating margin allows us to monitor our financial performance and efficiency from period to period without the volatility   noted above in our discussion of adjusted operating income   and to compare our performance to industry peers on a basis that better reflects our performance in our core business. Adjusted operating margin is derived by dividing adjusted operating income by adjusted net revenues.

     Index  

Investment Advisory and Services Fees 
    
  Investment advisory and services fees are the largest component of our revenues. These fees generally are calculated as a percentage of the value of AUM as of a specified date, or as a percentage of the value of average AUM for the applicable billing period, and vary with the type of investment service, the size of account and the total amount of assets we manage for a particular client. Accordingly, fee income generally increases or decreases as AUM increase or decrease and is affected by market appreciation or depreciation, the addition of new client accounts or client contributions of additional assets to existing accounts, withdrawals of assets from and termination of client accounts, purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares, shifts of assets between accounts or products with different fee structures, and acquisitions. Our average basis points realized (investment advisory and services fees divided by average AUM) generally approximate 50 to 110 basis points for actively-managed equity services, 15 to 60 basis points for actively-managed fixed income services and 5 to 20 basis points for passively-managed services. Average basis points realized for other services could range from 5 basis points for certain Institutional asset allocation services to over 100 basis points for certain Retail and Private Wealth Management alternative services. The ranges discussed above include all-inclusive fee arrangements (covering investment management, trade execution and other services) for our Private Wealth Management clients. 
    
  We calculate AUM using established market-based valuation methods and fair valuation (non-observable market) methods. Market-based valuation methods include: last sale/settle prices from an exchange for actively-traded listed equities, options and futures; evaluated bid prices from recognized pricing vendors for fixed income, asset-backed or mortgage-backed issues; mid prices from recognized pricing vendors and brokers for credit default swaps; and quoted bids or spreads from pricing vendors and brokers for other derivative products. Fair valuation methods include: discounted cash flow models, evaluation of assets versus liabilities or any other methodology that is validated and approved by our Valuation Committee (  see paragraph immediately below   for more information regarding our Valuation Committee). Fair valuation methods are used only where AUM cannot be valued using market-based valuation methods, such as in the case of private equity or illiquid securities. Investments utilizing fair valuation methods comprise an insignificant amount of our total AUM. 
    
  The Valuation Committee, which consists of senior officers and employees, is responsible for overseeing the pricing and valuation of all investments held in client and AB portfolios. The Valuation Committee has adopted a Statement of Pricing Policies describing principles and policies that apply to pricing and valuing investments held in these portfolios. We also have a Pricing Group, which reports to the Valuation Committee and is responsible for overseeing the pricing process for all investments. 
    
  We sometimes charge our clients performance-based fees. In these situations, we charge a base advisory fee and are eligible to earn an additional performance-based fee or incentive allocation that is calculated as either a percentage of absolute investment results or a percentage of investment results in excess of a stated benchmark over a specified period of time. Some performance-based fees include a high-watermark provision, which generally provides that if a client account underperforms relative to its performance target (whether absolute or relative to a specified benchmark), it must gain back such underperformance before we can collect future performance-based fees. Therefore, if we fail to achieve our performance target for a particular period, we will not earn a performance-based fee for that period and, for accounts with a high-watermark provision, our ability to earn future performance-based fees will be impaired. We are eligible to earn performance-based fees on 6.9%, 4.0% and 1.0% of the assets we manage for institutional clients, private wealth clients and retail clients, respectively (in total, 4.5% of our AUM). 
    
  During the first nine months of 2016, as General Partner of AllianceBernstein U.S. Real Estate L.P. ( Real Estate Fund ), we received a carried interest distribution of $48.7 million. In accordance with our revenue recognition policies, we did not recognize this carried interest distribution as performance fee revenues, instead recording a deferred revenue liability, because the distribution is subject to claw-back provisions. We will recognize the distribution as revenues when the potential claw-back obligation is mathematically remote, which may not occur until at or near termination of the Real Estate Fund. In addition, we have revenue-sharing arrangements whereby certain employees are entitled to a share of carried interest proceeds distributed by certain funds, including the Real Estate Fund. As such, we distributed $24.0 million of these carried interest proceeds to certain Real Estate Fund employees. We have recorded this payment, which, like our carried interest distribution, is subject to claw-back provisions, as an advance to employees and will recognize it as compensation expense in the period in which the applicable revenue is recognized. 
    
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, our investment advisory and services fees increased by $3.1 million, or 0.6%, from the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to a $2.7 million, or 0.6%, increase in base fees, which primarily resulted from a 3.3% increase in average AUM and the impact of a shift in product mix from global fixed income and active equity products into other products that generally have lower fees. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our investment advisory and services fees decreased by $78.3 million, or 5.2%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to a $61.7 million, or 4.2%, decrease in base fees, which primarily resulted from a 0.6% decrease in average AUM and the impact of a shift in product mix from global fixed income and active equity products into other products that generally have lower fees. Additionally, our performance-based fees decreased $16.6 million from the prior year.

     Index  

Institutional investment advisory and services fees for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $1.2 million, or 1.1%, from the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to a $0.7 million increase in performance-based fees. Additionally, base fees increased $0.5 million, or 0.4%. The increase in base fees was due to an increase in average AUM of 3.8% and the impact of a shift in product mix from active equities into active fixed income products that generally have lower fees. Institutional investment advisory and services fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $24.8 million, or 7.5%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to a $17.5 million, or 5.5%, decrease in base fees. The decrease in base fees was due to the impact of a shift in product mix from active equities into active fixed income products that generally have lower fees. Additionally, performance-based fees decreased $7.3 million from the prior year.   
    
  Retail investment advisory and services fees for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were essentially flat as compared to the corresponding period in 2015. Retail investment advisory and services fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $51.1 million, or 7.8%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to a $43.1 million, or 6.7%, decrease in base fees. The decrease in base fees was due to a decrease in average AUM of 2.8% and the impact of a shift in product mix from non-U.S. global fixed income mutual funds to U.S. tax-exempt mutual funds, which generally have lower fees. Additionally, performance-based fees decreased $8.0 million from the prior year. 
    
  Private Wealth Management investment advisory and services fees for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $1.8 million, or 1.0%, from the three months ended September 30, 2015, due to an increase in base fees of $3.1 million, or 1.8%, resulting from a 4.7% increase in average AUM, offset by a $1.3 million decrease in performance-based fees. Private Wealth Management investment advisory and services fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $2.4 million, or 0.5%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2015, due to a decrease in base fees of $1.1 million, or 0.2%. Base fees decreased primarily due to a shift in product mix from active equities to active fixed income products with lower fees. 
    
  Bernstein Research Services 
    
  Bernstein Research Services revenue consists principally of equity commissions received for providing equity research and brokerage-related services to institutional investors. 
    
  Revenues from Bernstein Research Services for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $16.2 million, or 12.7%, compared to the corresponding period in 2015 due to a steep drop in market trading volumes across the U.S. and Europe. Revenues from Bernstein Research Services for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $22.6 million, or 6.0%, compared to the corresponding period in 2015 due to declines in client revenues across the U.S., Europe and Asia.  
    
  Distribution Revenues 
    
  Two of our subsidiaries act as distributors and/or placing agents of company-sponsored mutual funds and receive distribution services fees from certain of those funds as partial reimbursement of the distribution expenses they incur. Period-over-period fluctuations of distribution revenues typically are in line with fluctuations of the corresponding average AUM of these mutual funds. 
  Distribution revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $7.7 million, or 7.3%, and $38.8 million, or 11.9%, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2015, primarily due to the corresponding average AUM of these mutual funds decreasing 6.3% and 10.1%, respectively.  
    
  Dividend and Interest Income and Interest Expense 
    
  Dividend and interest income consists primarily of investment income and interest earned on customer margin balances and U.S. Treasury Bills. Interest expense principally reflects interest accrued on cash balances in customers  brokerage accounts. Dividend and interest income, net of interest expense, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $1.2 million, or 24.8%, and $2.8 million, or 19.5%, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2015, primarily due to higher broker-dealer related activity.

Investment Gains (Losses) 
    
  Investment gains (losses) consist primarily of realized and unrealized investment gains or losses on: (i) employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments, (ii) investments owned by our consolidated venture capital fund, (iii) U.S. Treasury Bills, (iv) market-making in exchange-traded options and equities, (v) seed capital investments, (vi) derivatives and (vii) investments in our consolidated VIEs. Effective January 1, 2016, upon adoption of a new accounting standard (  see Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements  ), our consolidated private equity fund investments are included with investments in consolidated VIEs. Investments gains (losses) also include realized gains or losses on the sale of seed capital investments classified as available-for-sale securities and equity in earnings of proprietary investments in limited partnership hedge funds that we sponsor and manage. 
    
  Investment gains (losses) are as follows: 

During the first quarter of 2016, we sold our investment in Jasper, a company in which we owned a 7.6% equity interest. We expect to receive a total of $85.5 million in cash, subject to final transaction costs and working capital adjustments. During March 2016, the transaction closed and we received $74.8 million in cash, recorded a $10.7 million receivable for the balance retained in escrow for 18 months and recorded an investment gain of $75.3 million.

Other Revenues 
    
  Other revenues consist of fees earned for transfer agency services provided to company-sponsored mutual funds, fees earned for administration and recordkeeping services provided to company-sponsored mutual funds and the general accounts of AXA and its subsidiaries, and other miscellaneous revenues. Other revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $0.6 million, or 2.4%, and $5.6 million, or 7.3%, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2015, primarily due to the recording of other revenues related to our consolidated VIEs in the current year, offset by lower shareholder servicing fees. 
    
  Expenses 
    
  The components of expenses are as follows: 

Employee Compensation and Benefits 
    
  Employee compensation and benefits consist of base compensation (including salaries and severance), annual short-term incentive compensation awards (cash bonuses), annual long-term incentive compensation awards, commissions, fringe benefits and other employment costs (including recruitment, training, temporary help and meals). 
    
  Compensation expense as a percentage of net revenues was 42.4% and 43.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Compensation expense as a percentage of net revenues was 41.4% and 42.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Compensation expense generally is determined on a discretionary basis and is primarily a function of our firm s current-year financial performance. The amounts of incentive compensation we award are designed to  
  
   47 

     Index  

motivate, reward and retain top talent while aligning our executives' interests with the interests of our Unitholders. Senior management, with the approval of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of AllianceBernstein Corporation ( Compensation Committee ), periodically confirms that the appropriate metric to consider in determining the amount of incentive compensation is the ratio of adjusted employee compensation and benefits expense to adjusted net revenues. Adjusted net revenues used in the adjusted compensation ratio are the same as the adjusted net revenues presented as a non-GAAP measure (  discussed earlier in this MD A  ). Adjusted employee compensation and benefits expense is total employee compensation and benefits expense minus other employment costs such as recruitment, training, temporary help and meals (which were 1.1% and 1.2%, respectively, of adjusted net revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and were 1.5% and 1.3%, respectively, of adjusted net revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015), and excludes the impact of mark-to-market vesting expense, as well as dividends and interest expense, associated with employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments. Senior management, with the approval of the Compensation Committee, has established as an objective that adjusted employee compensation and benefits expense generally should not exceed 50% of our adjusted net revenues, except in unexpected or unusual circumstances. Our ratio of adjusted compensation expense as a percentage of adjusted revenues was 50.0% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
    
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, employee compensation and benefits expense decreased $0.8 million, or 0.3%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to lower base compensation of $2.2 million, lower fringes and other costs of $1.8 million, partially offset by higher incentive compensation of $2.4 million and higher commissions of $0.8 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, employee compensation and benefits expense decreased $53.5 million, or 5.5%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to lower incentive compensation of $51.1 million, lower commissions of $5.8 million and lower fringes and other costs of $5.6 million, partially offset by higher base compensation of $9.0 million, reflecting higher severance costs.  
    
  Promotion and Servicing 
    
  Promotion and servicing expenses include distribution-related payments to financial intermediaries for distribution of AB mutual funds and amortization of deferred sales commissions paid to financial intermediaries for the sale of back-end load shares of AB mutual funds. Also included in this expense category are costs related to travel and entertainment, advertising and promotional materials. 
    
  Promotion and servicing expenses decreased $9.0 million, or 5.6%, during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease primarily was due to lower amortization of deferred sales commissions of $2.6 million, lower transfer fees of $1.8 million, lower travel and entertainment of $1.7 million and lower trade execution and clearing costs of $1.6 million. Promotion and servicing expenses decreased $40.1 million, or 7.9%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease primarily was due to lower distribution-related payments of $23.5 million, lower amortization of deferred sales commissions of $5.9 million, lower travel and entertainment of $4.9 million, lower marketing expenses of $4.2 million and lower transfer fees of $2.0 million. 
    
  General and Administrative 
    
  General and administrative expenses include portfolio services expenses, technology expenses, professional fees and office-related expenses (occupancy, communications and similar expenses). General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 14.2% (including and excluding real estate credits) and 14.8% (14.6% excluding real estate charges) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. General and administrative expenses decreased $3.3 million, or 3.0%, during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to lower real estate charges of $1.8 million. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 15.5% (14.4% excluding real estate charges) and 14.2% (14.1% excluding real estate charges) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. General and administrative expenses increased $22.2 million, or 6.8%, during the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to higher real estate charges of $23.4 million.  
    
  Contingent Payment Arrangements 
    
  Contingent payment arrangements reflect changes in estimates of contingent payment liabilities associated with acquisitions in previous periods, as well as accretion expense of these liabilities. The credit to operating expenses of $20.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflects changes in estimates of the contingent consideration payable relating to our 2013 and 2010 acquisitions of $21.5 million, offset by the accretion expense of $1.1 million. There were no changes in estimates during the first nine months of 2015.

Income Taxes 
    
  AB, a private limited partnership, is not subject to federal or state corporate income taxes, but is subject to a 4.0% New York City unincorporated business tax ( UBT ). Our domestic corporate subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local income taxes and generally are included in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return. Separate state and local income tax returns also are filed. Foreign corporate subsidiaries generally are subject to taxes in the jurisdictions where they are located. 
    
  Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $0.2 million, or 2.0%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease is due to a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter of 6.2% compared to 8.3% in the third quarter of 2015, offset by higher pre-tax earnings. The lower effective tax rate is driven by a favorable increase in the mix of earnings across the tax filing group with higher portions of earnings generated by the U.S. partnership, which has a lower tax rate. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $2.5 million, or 7.3%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in tax expense is due to higher pre-tax earnings, offset by a lower year-to-date effective tax rate of 7.4% compared to 7.6% in the first nine months of 2015.  
    
  Net Income (Loss) of Consolidated Entities Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests 
    
  Net income (loss) of consolidated entities attributable to non-controlling interests primarily consists of limited partner interests owned by other investors in our consolidated VIEs. During the first nine months of 2016, we had $14.8 million of net gains of consolidated entities attributable to non-controlling interests. 

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 
    
  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , net cash provided by operating activities was $1,141.9 million, compared to $804.3 million during the corresponding   2015   period. The change primarily is due to a significant increase in broker-dealer related payables (net of receivable and segregated U.S. Treasury bills activity) of $196.2 million and higher seed capital net redemptions, offset by higher broker-dealer purchases (net of redemptions) of $145.7 million. 
    
  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , net cash used in investing activities was $48.7 million, compared to $12.9 million during the corresponding   2015   period. The change reflects the third quarter 2016 purchase of a business of $20.5 million and higher purchases of furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements.  
    
  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , net cash used in financing activities was $839.5 million, compared to $683.2 million during the corresponding   2015   period. The change reflects an increase in overdrafts payable of $92.6 million, higher net repayments of commercial paper of $64.2 million, redemptions of non-controlling interests in consolidated VIEs of $39.5 million and higher repurchases of AB Holding Units of $29.2 million, offset by lower distributions to the General Partner and Unitholders of $61.5 million as a result of lower earnings (distributions on earnings are paid one quarter in arrears). 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , AB had $795.5 million of cash and cash equivalents (excluding cash and cash equivalents of consolidated VIEs), all of which is available for liquidity, but consists primarily of cash on deposit for our broker-dealers to comply with various customer clearing activities and cash held by foreign subsidiaries for which a permanent investment election for U.S. tax purposes is taken. If the cash held at our foreign subsidiaries of $526.2 million, which includes cash on deposit for our foreign broker-dealers, is repatriated to the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. income taxes on these funds, based on the unremitted amount. We currently intend to permanently reinvest our historical and current earnings outside the U.S. Effective January 1, 2017, we intend to repatriate future earnings outside the U.S., as a result of which we expect our effective tax rate to increase. 
    
  Debt and Credit Facilities 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , AB had   $387.0 million   and   $581.7 million  , respectively, in commercial paper outstanding with weighted average interest rates of approximately   0.6%   and   0.5%  , respectively. The commercial paper is short term in nature, and as such, recorded value is estimated to approximate fair value (and considered a Level 2 security in the fair value hierarchy). Average daily borrowings of commercial paper during the first   nine   months of   2016   and the full year   2015   were   $425.6 million   and   $387.9 million  , respectively, with weighted average interest rates of approximately   0.6%   and   0.3%  , respectively. 
    
  AB has a $1.0 billion committed, unsecured senior revolving credit facility ( Credit Facility ) with a group of commercial banks and other lenders, which matures on October 22, 2019. The Credit Facility provides for possible increases in the principal amount by up to an aggregate incremental amount of $250.0 million; any such increase is subject to the consent of the affected lenders. The Credit Facility is available for AB and Sanford C. Bernstein   Co., LLC ("SCB LLC") business purposes, including the support of AB s $1.0 billion commercial paper program. Both AB and SCB LLC can draw directly under the Credit Facility and  
  
   49 

     Index  

management may draw on the Credit Facility from time to time. AB has agreed to guarantee the obligations of SCB LLC under the Credit Facility. 
    
  The Credit Facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, which are customary for facilities of this type, including restrictions on dispositions of assets, restrictions on liens, a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with these covenants. The Credit Facility also includes customary events of default (with customary grace periods, as applicable), including provisions under which, upon the occurrence of an event of default, all outstanding loans may be accelerated and/or lender s commitments may be terminated. Also, under such provisions, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency- or bankruptcy-related events of default, all amounts payable under the Credit Facility would automatically become immediately due and payable, and the lender s commitments would automatically terminate. 
    
  Amounts under the Credit Facility may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed by us from time to time until the maturity of the facility. Voluntary prepayments and commitment reductions requested by us are permitted at any time without fee (other than customary breakage costs relating to the prepayment of any drawn loans) upon proper notice and subject to a minimum dollar requirement. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum, which will be, at our option, a rate equal to an applicable margin, which is subject to adjustment based on the credit ratings of AB, plus one of the following indexes: London Interbank Offered Rate; a floating base rate; or the Federal Funds rate. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had no amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility. During the first   nine   months of   2016   and the full year   2015  , we did not draw upon the Credit Facility. 
    
  In addition, SCB LLC has four uncommitted lines of credit with four financial institutions. Three of these lines of credit permit us to borrow up to an aggregate of approximately $225.0 million, with AB named as an additional borrower, while one line has no stated limit. As of September 30, 2016 and   December 31, 2015  , SCB LLC had no bank loans outstanding. Average daily borrowings of bank loans during the first   nine   months of   2016   and full year   2015   were $4.6 million and $3.9 million, respectively, with weighted average interest rates of approximately 1.1% and 1.2%, respectively. 
    
  Our financial condition and access to public and private debt markets should provide adequate liquidity for our general business needs. Management believes that cash flow from operations and the issuance of debt and AB Units or AB Holding Units will provide us with the resources we need to meet our financial obligations. See    Cautions Regarding Forward-Looking Statements   . 

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
    
  AB s capital commitments, which consist primarily of operating leases for office space, generally are funded from future operating cash flows.

CAUTIONS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
    
  Certain statements provided by management in this report and in the portion of AB s Form 10-Q attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 are  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The most significant of these factors include, but are not limited to, the following: the performance of financial markets, the investment performance of sponsored investment products and separately-managed accounts, general economic conditions, industry trends, future acquisitions, integration of acquired companies, competitive conditions and government regulations, including changes in tax regulations and rates and the manner in which the earnings of publicly-traded partnerships are taxed. We caution readers to carefully consider such factors. Further, these forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made; we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements. For further information regarding these forward-looking statements and the factors that could cause actual results to differ,     see  Risk Factors  in Part I, Item 1A   of our Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015     and Part II, Item 1A     in this Form 10-Q. Any or all of the forward-looking statements that we make in our Form 10-K, this Form 10-Q, other documents we file with or furnish to the SEC, and any other public statements we issue, may turn out to be wrong. It is important to remember that other factors besides   those listed in  Risk Factors  and those listed below   also could affect adversely our revenues, financial condition, results of operations and business prospects. 
    
  The forward-looking statements referred to in   the preceding paragraph  , most of which directly affect AB but also affect AB Holding because AB Holding s principal source of income and cash flow is attributable to its investment in AB, include statements regarding: 

Our belief that the cash flow AB Holding realizes from its investment in AB will provide AB Holding with the resources it needs to meet its financial obligations:   AB Holding s cash flow is dependent on the quarterly cash distributions it receives from AB. Accordingly, AB Holding s ability to meet its financial obligations is dependent on AB s cash flow from its operations, which is subject to the performance of the capital markets and other factors beyond our control. 

Our financial condition and ability to access the public and private capital markets providing adequate liquidity for our general business needs:   Our financial condition is dependent on our cash flow from operations, which is subject to the performance of the capital markets, our ability to maintain and grow client assets under management and other factors beyond our control. Our ability to access public and private capital markets on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions, our firm s credit ratings, our profitability and changes in government regulations, including tax rates and interest rates. 

The outcome of litigation:   Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and excessive damage awards do occur. Though we have stated that we do not expect certain pending legal proceedings to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, any settlement or judgment with respect to a pending or future legal proceeding could be significant, and could have such an effect. 

The possibility that we will engage in open market purchases of AB Holding Units to help fund anticipated obligations under our incentive compensation award program:   The number of AB Holding Units AB may decide to buy in future periods, if any, to help fund incentive compensation awards depends on various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the fluctuation in the price of an AB Holding Unit (NYSE: AB) and the availability of cash to make these purchases. 

Our determination that adjusted employee compensation expense should not exceed 50% of our adjusted net revenues:    Aggregate employee compensation reflects employee performance and competitive compensation levels. Fluctuations in our revenues and/or changes in competitive compensation levels could result in adjusted employee compensation expense exceeding 50% of our adjusted net revenues. 
                
    Our expectation that, as a result of repatriating future non-U.S. earnings, effective January 1, 2017, our effective tax rate will increase:   Our effective tax rate fluctuates based on the mix of our earnings across our tax filing group, which includes our U.S.  
     
   51 

     Index  

partnership, our U.S. corporate subsidiaries and our corporate subsidiaries operating in various non-U.S. jurisdictions, and the differences between the tax rates in the U.S and the other jurisdictions where we conduct business.  
   
           Item 3.  
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
       
  There have been no material changes in AB s market risk from the information provided under    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    in Part II, Item 7A of AB's Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

Item 4.  
    Controls and Procedures 
       
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Each of AB Holding and AB maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and the Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), to permit timely decisions regarding our disclosure. 
    
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the CEO and the CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the CEO and the CFO concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  No change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the   third   quarter of   2016   that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
