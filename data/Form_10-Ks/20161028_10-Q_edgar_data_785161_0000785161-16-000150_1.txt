1. 
    Basis of Presentation 
     HealthSouth Corporation, incorporated in Delaware in 1984, including its subsidiaries, is one of the nation s largest providers of post-acute healthcare services, offering both facility-based and home-based post-acute services in   34   states and Puerto Rico through its network of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, home health agencies, and hospice agencies. 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of HealthSouth Corporation and Subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in HealthSouth s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on   February 24, 2016   (the    2015   Form 10-K ). The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC applicable to interim financial information. Certain information and note disclosures included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America have been omitted in these interim statements, as allowed by such SEC rules and regulations. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015   has been derived from audited financial statements, but it does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. However, we believe the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. 
  The unaudited results of operations for the interim periods shown in these financial statements are not necessarily indicative of operating results for the entire year. In our opinion, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements recognize all adjustments of a normal recurring nature considered necessary to fairly state the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for each interim period presented. 
  See also Note   12  ,   Segment Reporting  . 
   
  Variable Interest Entities    
  Effective January 1, 2016, in connection with our adoption of ASU 2015-02, we updated our evaluation of all jointly held legal entities to determine whether they are now variable interest entities ( VIEs ) under the new guidance. Any entity considered a VIE is evaluated to determine which party is the primary beneficiary and thus should consolidate the VIE. This analysis is complex, involves uncertainties, and requires significant judgment on various matters. In order to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we must determine what activities most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity, whether we have the power to direct those activities, and if our obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the VIE could potentially be significant to the VIE. 
   
  Net Operating Revenues    
  We derived consolidated   Net operating revenues   from the following payor sources:

  Recent Accounting Pronouncements    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,  Consolidations (Topic 810) - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,  which provided guidance on evaluating whether a reporting entity should consolidate certain legal entities. Specifically, the amendments modified the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs. Under this analysis, limited partnerships and other similar entities are considered a VIE unless the limited partners hold substantive kick-out rights or participating rights. Further, the amendments eliminated the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership under the voting interest model, as well as affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships. This standard was effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those annual periods. We elected to adopt this guidance using the modified retrospective approach. Our adoption of this guidance resulted in certain limited partnership-like entities that were previously consolidated as voting interest entities to now be consolidated as VIEs, for

    HealthSouth Corporation and Subsidiaries 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

which additional disclosures are required. Our adoption of ASU 2015-02 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See Note   3  ,   Variable Interest Entities  . 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842),  in order to increase transparency and comparability by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Under the new standard, lessees will recognize a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for all leases other than leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease. The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the liability, subject to adjustment, such as for initial direct costs. For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. Operating leases will result in straight-line expense while finance leases will result in an expense pattern similar to current capital leases. Classification will be based on criteria that are similar to those applied in current lease accounting. This standard will be effective for HealthSouth for the annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We continue to review the requirements of this standard and its impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718),  to simplify various aspects of share-based payment accounting and presentation. The new standard requires entities to record all of the tax effects related to share-based payments at settlement (or expiration) through the income statement. This will require us to reclassify tax benefits in excess of compensation cost ( windfalls ) and tax deficiencies ( shortfalls ) to the extent of previous windfalls from   Capital in excess of par value   to   Provision for income tax expense  . This change is required to be applied prospectively to all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies resulting from settlements after the date of adoption of the ASU. The standard eliminates the requirement to delay recognition of a windfall tax benefit until it reduces current taxes payable. This change is required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis, with a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening retained earnings. In addition, all income tax-related cash flows resulting from share-based windfall tax benefits are required to be reported as operating activities on the statement of cash flows as opposed to the current presentation as an inflow from financing activities and an outflow from operating activities. Either prospective or retrospective transition of this provision is permitted. Finally, the standard clarifies that all cash payments made to taxing authorities on the employees  behalf for withheld shares should be presented as financing activities on the statement of cash flows. This change will be applied retrospectively. For HealthSouth, this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted, with any adjustments reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. Upon adoption, we anticipate recognizing our net windfall balance as an increase to   Deferred income tax assets   and a corresponding decrease to   Accumulated deficit  . Additionally, the historical and future amount of cash flows resulting from share-based windfall benefits and cash payments made to taxing authorities on the employees  behalf for withheld shares will result in an increase to our historical and future   Cash flows from operating activities   and a decrease to   Cash flows from financing activities  . 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326),  which provides guidance for accounting for credit losses on financial instruments. The new guidance introduces an approach based on expected losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments and modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities. The new guidance is effective for HealthSouth for the annual period beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted beginning after December 15, 2018. We continue to review the requirements of this standard and any potential impact it may have on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,  to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. In addition, the standard clarifies when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows and cannot be separated, classification will depend on the predominant source or use. The new guidance is effective retrospectively for HealthSouth for the annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. We continue to review the requirements of this standard and any potential impact it may have on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

    Business Combinations 
     Inpatient Rehabilitation 
  In February 2016, we acquired   50%   of the inpatient rehabilitation hospital at CHI St. Vincent Hot Springs ( Hot Springs ), a   20  -bed inpatient rehabilitation hospital in Hot Springs, Arkansas, through a joint venture with St. Vincent Community Health Services, Inc. The acquisition, which was funded through a contribution to the consolidated joint venture, was not material to our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
  In August 2016, we acquired   50%   of the inpatient rehabilitation hospital at St. Joseph Regional Health Center ( Bryan ), a   19  -bed inpatient rehabilitation hospital in Bryan, Texas, through a joint venture with St. Joseph Health System. The acquisition, which was funded through a contribution to the consolidated joint venture, was not material to our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
  Also in August 2016, we acquired   51%   of the inpatient rehabilitation hospital at The Bernsen Rehabilitation Center at St. John ( Broken Arrow ), a   24  -bed inpatient rehabilitation hospital in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, through a joint venture with St. John Health System. The acquisition, which was funded through a contribution to the consolidated joint venture, was not material to our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
  Each of the above transactions was made to enhance our position and ability to provide inpatient rehabilitation services to patients in the applicable geographic areas. We accounted for these transactions under the acquisition method of accounting and reported the results of operations of the acquired hospitals from their respective dates of acquisition. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the respective acquisition dates. The fair values of the identifiable intangible assets were based on valuations using the income approach. The income approach is based on management s estimates of future operating results and cash flows discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital that reflects market participant assumptions. The excess of the fair value of the consideration conveyed over the fair value of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The goodwill reflects our expectations of our ability to gain access to and penetrate the acquired hospital s historical patient base and the benefits of being able to leverage operational efficiencies with favorable growth opportunities based on positive demographic trends in these markets.   None   of the goodwill recorded as a result of these transactions is deductible for federal income tax purposes. 
  The fair value of the assets acquired at the acquisition date were as follows (in millions):

Home Health and Hospice 
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we completed the following home health and hospice acquisitions, none of which were individually material to our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Each acquisition was made to enhance our position and ability to provide post-acute healthcare services to patients in the applicable geographic areas. Each acquisition was funded using cash on hand. 
             
    In May, 2016, we acquired Home Health Agency of Georgia, LLC ( Camellia ), a home health and hospice provider with   two   home health locations and   two   hospice locations in the Greater Atlanta area.  
                
    In July 2016, we acquired Advantage Health Inc. ( Advantage ), a home health provider with   one   location in Yuma, Arizona. 
                
    In September, 2016, we acquired   three   hospice agencies from Sotto International, Inc. ( Serenity ) located in Texarkana, Arkansas, Magnolia, Arkansas, and Texarkana, Texas. 
     We accounted for all of these transactions under the acquisition method of accounting and reported the results of operations of the acquired locations from their respective dates of acquisition. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the respective acquisition dates. The fair values of identifiable intangible assets were based on valuations using the cost and income approaches. The cost approach is based on amounts that would be required to replace the asset (i.e., replacement cost). The income approach is based on management s estimates of future operating results and cash flows discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital that reflects market participant assumptions. The excess of the fair value of the consideration conveyed over the fair value of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The goodwill reflects our expectations of our ability to utilize the acquired locations  mobile workforce and established relationships within each community and the benefits of being able to leverage operational efficiencies with favorable growth opportunities based on positive demographic trends in these markets. All goodwill recorded as a result of these transactions is deductible for federal income tax purposes. 
  The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date were as follows (in millions):

    Variable Interest Entities 
     As of   September 30, 2016  , we consolidated   ten   limited partnership-like entities that are VIEs and of which we are the primary beneficiary. All ten of these entities were also consolidated as of December 31, 2015. Our ownership percentages in these entities range from   6.8%   to   99.5%  . Through partnership and management agreements with or governing each of these entities, we manage all of these entities and handle all day-to-day operating decisions. Accordingly, we have the decision making power over the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of our VIEs and an obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. These decisions and significant activities include, but are not limited to, marketing efforts, oversight of patient admissions, medical training, nurse and therapist scheduling, provision of healthcare services, billing, collections and creation and maintenance of medical records. The terms of the agreements governing each of our VIEs prohibit us from using the assets of each VIE to satisfy the obligations of other entities.

    Investments in and Advances to Nonconsolidated Affiliates 
     As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   $13.0 million   and   $11.7 million  , respectively, of investments in and advances to nonconsolidated affiliates included in   Other long-term assets   in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Investments in and advances to nonconsolidated affiliates represent our investments in   seven   partially owned subsidiaries, of which   six   are general or limited partnerships, limited liability companies, or joint ventures in which HealthSouth or one of its subsidiaries is a general or limited partner, managing member, member, or venturer, as applicable. We do not control these affiliates but have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of certain of these affiliates. Our ownership percentages in these affiliates range from approximately   1%   to   60%  . We account for these investments using the cost and equity methods of accounting.

    Long-term Debt 
     Our long-term debt outstanding consists of the following (in millions): 

The following chart shows scheduled principal payments due on long-term debt for the next five years and thereafter (in millions): 

On February 23, 2016, we gave notice of, and made an irrevocable commitment for, the redemption of     $50 million     of the outstanding principal amount of our     existing 7.75% Senior Notes due 2022 (the  2022 Notes ).   On March   24, 2016  , we completed this redemption     using cash on hand and   capacity under our revolving credit facility. Pursuant to the terms of the 2022 Notes, this optional redemption was made at a price of     103.875%  , which resulted in a total cash outlay of approximately     $52 million  . As a result of this redemption, we recorded a     $2.4 million     Loss on early extinguishment of debt     in the first quarter of 2016. 
  On April 6, 2016, we gave notice of, and made an irrevocable commitment for, the redemption of an additional   $50 million   of the outstanding principal amount of the 2022 Notes. On May 6, 2016, we completed this redemption using cash on hand and capacity under our revolving credit facility. Pursuant to the terms of the 2022 Notes, this optional redemption was also made at a price of   103.875%  , which resulted in a total cash outlay of approximately   $52 million  . As a result of this redemption, we   recorded a     $2.4 million     L  oss on early extinguishment of debt   in the second quarter of 2016.  
  On July 28, 2016,   we gave notice of, and made an irrevocable commitment for, the     redemption of the remaining outstanding principal balance of     $76.0 million     of the 2022 Notes. On September 15, 2016, we completed this redemption using

    HealthSouth Corporation and Subsidiaries 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

cash on hand and capacity under our revolving credit facility.     Pursuant to the terms of the 2022 Notes, t  his optional redemption was made at a price of     102.583%  ,     which resulted in a total cash outlay of approximately   $78 million  . As a result of this redemption, we recorded a     $2.6 million     Loss on early extinguishment of debt     in the third quarter of 2016. 
  In February 2016, we entered into a development/lease agreement with CR HQ, LLC (the  Developer ) to construct our new corporate headquarters in Birmingham, Alabama. Under the terms of this agreement, the Developer is responsible for all costs of constructing the new facility  shell  which will then be leased to us for an initial term of   15   years with   four  ,   five  -year renewal options. The lease is expected to commence in the first half of 2018. We are responsible for the costs associated with improvements to the interior of the building. Due to the nature and extent of the tenant improvements we will be making to the new corporate headquarters and certain provisions of the development/lease agreement, we are deemed to be the accounting owner of the new corporate headquarters during the construction period. Construction commenced in the second quarter of 2016. Accordingly, we increased   Property and equipment, net   by   $10.3 million  , based on the construction costs incurred to date by the Developer, and recorded a corresponding noncurrent financing obligation liability of   $10.3 million   in   Long-term debt, net of current portion   within our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. The total financing obligation associated with the Developer s costs to construct the new corporate headquarters is estimated at   $56 million  . The amounts recorded for construction costs and the corresponding liability are non-cash activities for purposes of our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.

(1)     The three valuation techniques are: market approach (M), cost approach (C), and income approach (I). 
  The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined as follows: 
             
    Restricted marketable securities   - The fair values of our available-for-sale restricted marketable securities are determined based on quoted market prices in active markets or quoted prices, dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources supported by observable inputs in markets that are not considered to be active.  
                
    Redeemable noncontrolling interests   - The fair value of the   Redeemable noncontrolling interest   related to our home health segment is determined using the product of a twelve-month specified performance measure and a specified median market price multiple based on a basket of public health companies. To determine the fair value of the   Redeemable noncontrolling interests   in our joint venture hospitals, we use the applicable hospitals  projected operating results and cash flows discounted using a rate that reflects market participant assumptions for the applicable facilities. The projected operating results use management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the forecasted periods including assumptions for pricing and volume, operating expenses, and capital expenditures. See also Note   6  ,   Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests  . 
     In addition to assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, we are also required to record assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges or similar adjustments made to the carrying value of the applicable assets. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , we did not record any     gains or losses     related to our nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis as part of our continuing operations.

As discussed in Note 1,   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  ,  Fair Value Measurements,  to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the   2015   Form 10-K, the carrying value equals fair value for our financial instruments that are not included in the table below and are classified as current in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values for all of our other financial instruments are presented in the following table (in millions): 

Fair values for our long-term debt and financial commitments are determined using inputs, including quoted prices in nonactive markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly, or   Level 2   inputs within the fair value hierarchy. See Note 1,   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  ,  Fair Value Measurements,  to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the   2015   Form 10-K. 
   
           8. 
    Share-Based Payments 
     In February and May 2016, we issued a total of   0.8 million   restricted stock awards to members of our management team and our board of directors. Approximately   0.2 million   of these awards contain only a service condition, while the remainder contain both a service and a performance condition. For the awards that include a performance condition, the number of shares that will ultimately be granted to employees may vary based on the Company s performance during the applicable   two  -year performance measurement period. Additionally, in February 2016, we granted   0.1 million   stock options to members of our management team. The fair value of these awards and options was determined using the policies described in Note 1,   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  , and Note 13,   Share-Based Payments  , to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the   2015   Form 10-K. 
   
           9. 
    Income Taxes 
     Our   Provision for income tax expense   of   $42.1 million   and   $124.2 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily resulted from the application of our estimated effective blended federal and state income tax rate. Our   Provision for income tax expense   of     $35.9 million   and   $98.4 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively, primarily resulted from the application of our estimated effective blended federal and state income tax rate. 
  The   $72.6 million   of net deferred tax assets included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016   reflects management s assessment it is more likely than not we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize those deferred tax assets based on our current estimates and assumptions. As of   September 30, 2016  , we maintained a valuation allowance of   $28.3 million   due to uncertainties regarding our ability to utilize a portion of our state net operating losses ( NOLs ) and other credits before they expire. The amount of the valuation allowance has been determined for each tax jurisdiction based on the weight of all available evidence including management s estimates of taxable income for each jurisdiction in which we operate over the periods in which the related deferred tax assets will be recoverable. It is possible  

18 

    HealthSouth Corporation and Subsidiaries 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

we may be required to increase or decrease our valuation allowance at some future time if our forecast of future earnings varies from actual results on a consolidated basis or in the applicable state tax jurisdictions, or if the timing of future tax deductions differs from our expectations. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we estimate the tax benefit of combined federal NOLs and tax credits to be approximately   $18 million  . There is   $15.6 million   related to operating loss carryforwards resulting from excess tax benefits related to share-based awards, the benefits of which, when recognized, will be accounted for as a credit to   Capital in excess of par value   when they reduce taxes payable. Federal NOLs and tax credits expire in various amounts at varying times through 2036. We also have state NOLs that expire in various amounts at varying times through 2031. 
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we filed an automatic tax accounting method change related to the deductibility of bad debts pursuant to the non-accrual experience method which resulted in a tax benefit of approximately   $7 million  . This change did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate. We also filed a non-automatic tax accounting method change related to billings denied under pre-payment claims reviews conducted by certain of our Medicare Administrative Contractors and are awaiting acceptance by the IRS. If our request for the non-automatic tax accounting method change is accepted as filed, we anticipate additional tax benefits of approximately   $50 million   through September 30, 2016. Approximately   $44 million   of this amount represents pre-payment claims received in years prior to and including the year ending December 31, 2015. This change, if approved, is not expected to have a material impact on our effective tax rate. 
  Total remaining gross unrecognized tax benefits were   $2.8 million   and   $2.9 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, all of which would affect our effective tax rate if recognized. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending liability for unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):

Our continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Interest recorded as part of our income tax provision during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was not material. Accrued interest income related to income taxes as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was not material. 
  In December 2014, we signed an agreement with the IRS to begin participating in their Compliance Assurance Process, a program in which we and the IRS endeavor to agree on the treatment of significant tax positions prior to the filing of our federal income tax return. We signed a new agreement in December 2015 for the 2016 tax year. As a result of these agreements, the IRS surveyed our 2013, 2012 and 2011 federal income tax returns, will examine our 2016 return when filed and is currently examining our 2015 return. Our 2014 federal income tax return has been filed, and the IRS has not indicated its intent to examine or survey this return. We have settled federal income tax examinations with the IRS for all tax years through 2013. Our state income tax returns are also periodically examined by various regulatory taxing authorities. We are currently under audit by five states for tax years ranging from 2007 through 2014. 
  For the tax years that remain open under the applicable statutes of limitation, amounts related to unrecognized tax benefits have been considered by management in its estimate of our potential net recovery of prior years  income taxes. Based on discussions with taxing authorities, we anticipate up to   $2.6 million   of our unrecognized tax benefits may be released within the next 12 months.

The following table sets forth the reconciliation between basic weighted average common shares outstanding and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding (in millions): 

In October 2015, February 2016, and May 2016, our board of directors declared cash dividends of   $0.23   per share that were paid in January 2016, April 2016, and July 2016, respectively. On July 21, 2016, our board of directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend and declared a cash dividend of   $0.24   per share, payable on October 17, 2016 to stockholders of record on October 3, 2016. On October 20, 2016, our board of directors declared a cash dividend of   $0.24   per share, payable on January 17, 2017 to stockholders of record on January 3, 2017. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , accrued common stock dividends of   $22.3 million   and   $21.3 million  , respectively, were included in   Accrued expenses and other current liabilities   in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Future dividend payments are subject to declaration by our board of directors. 
  On April 22, 2015, we delivered notice of the exercise of our rights to force conversion of all outstanding shares of our   Convertible perpetual preferred stock   (par value of   $0.10   per share and liquidation preference of   $1,000   per share) pursuant to the underlying certificate of designations. The effective date of the conversion was April 23, 2015. On that date, each share of preferred stock automatically converted into   33.9905   shares of our common stock (par value of   $0.01   per share). We completed the forced conversion by issuing and delivering in the aggregate   3,271,415   shares of our common stock to the registered holders of the   96,245   shares of the preferred stock outstanding and paying cash in lieu of fractional shares due to those holders. 
  The indenture underlying our convertible notes includes antidilutive protection that requires adjustments to the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion and the exercise price for common stock upon the occurrence of certain events, including payment of cash dividends on our common stock after a   de minimis   threshold. At issuance, the convertible notes had a conversion price of   $39.65   per share, which was equal to an initial conversion rate of   25.2194 shares per $1,000 principal amount   of the convertible notes. The payment of dividends on our common stock has triggered and will continue to trigger, from time to time, the antidilutive adjustment provisions of the convertible notes. The current conversion price of the conve  rtible notes is     $37.16     per share, and the conversion rate is     26.9106     for each $1,000 principal amount of the convertible notes. 
  See Note 8,   Long-term Debt  , Note 10,   Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock  , and Note 16,   Earnings per Common Share  , to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the   2015   Form 10-K for additional information related to our convertible notes, common stock, common stock warrants, and convertible perpetual preferred stock.  
   
           11. 
    Contingencies and Other Commitments 
     We operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry. As a result, various lawsuits, claims, and legal and regulatory proceedings have been and can be expected to be instituted or asserted against us. The resolution of any such lawsuits, claims, or legal and regulatory proceedings could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in a given period.  
  Nichols Litigation  
  We have been named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed March 28, 2003 by several individual stockholders in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Alabama, captioned   Nichols v. HealthSouth Corp  . The plaintiffs allege that we, some of our former  

21 

    HealthSouth Corporation and Subsidiaries 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

officers, and our former investment bank engaged in a scheme to overstate and misrepresent our earnings and financial position. The plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages. This case was stayed in the Circuit Court on August 8, 2005. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on November 9, 2010 to which we responded with a motion to dismiss filed on December 22, 2010. During a hearing on February 24, 2012, plaintiffs  counsel indicated his intent to dismiss certain claims against us. Instead, on March 9, 2012, the plaintiffs amended their complaint to include additional securities fraud claims against HealthSouth and add several former officers to the lawsuit. On September 12, 2012, the plaintiffs further amended their complaint to request certification as a class action. One of those named officers has repeatedly attempted to remove the case to federal district court, most recently on December 11, 2012. We filed our latest motion to remand the case back to state court on January 10, 2013. On September 27, 2013, the federal court remanded the case back to state court. On November 25, 2014, the plaintiffs filed another amended complaint to assert new allegations relating to the time period of 1997 to 2002. On December 10, 2014, we filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds the plaintiffs lack standing because their claims are derivative in nature, and the claims are time-barred by the statute of limitations. On May 26, 2016, the court granted our motion to dismiss. The plaintiffs appealed the dismissal of the case to the Supreme Court of Alabama on June 28, 2016. The Supreme Court has not yet scheduled a hearing on the appeal. 
  We intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case. Based on the stage of litigation, review of the current facts and circumstances as we understand them, the nature of the underlying claim, the results of the proceedings to date, and the nature and scope of the defense we continue to mount, we do not believe an adverse judgment or settlement is probable in this matter, and it is also not possible to estimate the amount of loss, if any, or range of possible loss that might result from an adverse judgment or settlement of this case. 
  Other Litigation  
  One   of our hospital subsidiaries was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed August 12, 2013 by an individual in the Circuit Court of Etowah County, Alabama, captioned   Honts     v. HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital of Gadsden, LLC.   The plaintiff alleged that her mother, who died more than three months after being discharged from our hospital, received an unprescribed opiate medication at the hospital. We deny the patient received any such medication, accounted for all the opiates at the hospital and argued the plaintiff established no causal liability between the actions of our staff and her mother s death. The plaintiff sought recovery for punitive damages. On May 18, 2016, the jury in this case returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for   $20.0 million  . On June 17, 2016, we filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, a motion for new trial or, in the further alternative, a motion seeking reduction of the damages awarded (collectively, the  post-judgment motions ). The trial court denied the post-judgment motions. We appealed the verdict as well as the rulings on the post-judgment motions to the Supreme Court of Alabama on October 12, 2016. The Supreme Court has not yet scheduled a hearing on the appeal. We posted a bond in the amount of the judgment pending resolution of our appeal. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case. Although we continue to believe in the merit of our defenses and counterarguments, we have recorded a liability of   $21.0 million   (including   $1.0 million   in fees and expenses) in   Accrued expenses and other liabilities   in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 with a corresponding receivable of $  15.0 million   in   Other current assets   for the portion of the liability we would expect to be covered through our excess insurance coverages, resulting in a net charge of an additional   $5.7 million   to   Other operating expenses   in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The   $6.0 million   portion of this liability would be a covered claim through our captive insurance subsidiary, HCS, Ltd.  
    
  Governmental Inquiries and Investigations  
  On June 24, 2011, we received a document subpoena addressed to HealthSouth Hospital of Houston, a long-term acute care hospital ( LTCH ) we closed in August 2011, and issued from the Dallas, Texas office of the HHS-OIG. The subpoena stated it was in connection with an investigation of possible false or otherwise improper claims submitted to Medicare and Medicaid and requested documents and materials relating to patient admissions, length of stay, and discharge matters at this closed LTCH. We furnished the documents requested and have heard nothing from the HHS-OIG since December 2012. 
  On March 4, 2013, we received document subpoenas from an office of the HHS-OIG addressed to   four   of our hospitals. Those subpoenas also requested complete copies of medical records for   100   patients treated at each of those hospitals between September 2008 and June 2012. The investigation is being conducted by the United States Department of Justice (the  DOJ ). On April 24, 2014, we received document subpoenas relating to an additional   seven   of our hospitals. The new subpoenas reference substantially similar investigation subject matter as the original subpoenas and request materials from the  

22 

    HealthSouth Corporation and Subsidiaries 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

period January 2008 through December 2013.   Two   of the four hospitals addressed in the original set of subpoenas have received supplemental subpoenas to cover this new time period. The most recent subpoenas do not include requests for specific patient files. However, in February 2015, the DOJ requested the voluntary production of the medical records of an additional   70   patients, some of whom were treated in hospitals not subject to the subpoenas, and we provided these records.  
  All of the subpoenas are in connection with an investigation of alleged improper or fraudulent claims submitted to Medicare and Medicaid and request documents and materials relating to practices, procedures, protocols and policies, of certain pre- and post-admissions activities at these hospitals including, among other things, marketing functions, pre-admission screening, post-admission physician evaluations, patient assessment instruments, individualized patient plans of care, and compliance with the Medicare   60%   rule. Under the Medicare rule commonly referred to as the    60%   rule,  an inpatient rehabilitation hospital must treat   60%   or more of its patients from at least one of a specified list of medical conditions in order to be reimbursed at the inpatient rehabilitation hospital payment rates, rather than at the lower acute care hospital payment rates.  
  We are cooperating fully with the DOJ in connection with these subpoenas and are currently unable to predict the timing or outcome of the related investigations.

  The False Claims Act, 18 U.S.C.   287, allows private citizens, called  relators,  to institute civil proceedings alleging violations of the False Claims Act. These   qui tam   cases are generally sealed by the court at the time of filing. The only parties typically privy to the information contained in the complaint are the relator, the federal government, and the presiding court. It is possible that   qui tam   lawsuits have been filed against us and that those suits remain under seal or that we are unaware of such filings or prevented by existing law, court order, or agreement with the government from discussing or disclosing the filing of such suits. We may be subject to liability under one or more undisclosed   qui tam   cases brought pursuant to the False Claims Act. 
  It is our obligation as a participant in Medicare and other federal healthcare programs to routinely conduct audits and reviews of the accuracy of our billing systems and other regulatory compliance matters. As a result of these reviews, we have made, and will continue to make, disclosures to the HHS-OIG and the United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services relating to amounts we suspect represent over-payments from these programs, whether due to inaccurate billing or otherwise. Some of these disclosures have resulted in, or may result in, HealthSouth refunding amounts to Medicare or other federal healthcare programs. 
   
   Our internal financial reporting and management structure is focused on the major types of services provided by HealthSouth. We manage our operations using   two   operating segments which are also our reportable segments: (1) inpatient rehabilitation and (2) home health and hospice. These reportable operating segments are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer, who is our chief operating decision maker, to assess performance and allocate resources. The following is a brief description of our reportable segments: 
             
    Inpatient Rehabilitation   - Our national network of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals stretches across     30   states and Puerto Rico, with a concentration of hospitals in the eastern half of the United States and Texas. As of   September 30, 2016  , we operate     122     inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, including     one   hospital that operates as a joint venture which we account for using the equity method of accounting. In addition, we manage     four   inpatient rehabilitation units through management contracts. We provide specialized rehabilitative treatment on both an inpatient and outpatient basis. Our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals provide a higher level of rehabilitative care to patients who are recovering from conditions such as stroke and other neurological disorders, cardiac and pulmonary conditions, brain and spinal cord injuries, complex orthopedic conditions, and amputations. 
                
    Home Health and Hospice   - As of   September 30, 2016  , we provide home health and hospice services in     223   locations across     24     stat  es.     Two   of these agencies operate as joint ventures which we account for using the equity method of accounting. Our home health services include a comprehensive range of Medicare-certified home nursing services to adult patients in need of care. These services include, among others, skilled nursing, physical, occupational, and speech therapy, medical social work, and home health aide services. We also provide

specialized home care services in Texas and Kansas for pediatric patients with severe medical conditions. Our hospice services primarily include in-home services to terminally ill patients and their families to address patients  physical needs, including pain control and symptom management, and to provide emotional and spiritual support.  
  The accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 1,   Basis of Presentation  ,  Variable Interest Entities,  to these condensed consolidated financial statements and Note 1,   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  , to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the 2015 Form 10-K. All revenues for our services are generated through external customers. See Note 1,   Basis of Presentation  ,  Net Operating Revenues,  for the payor composition of our revenues. No corporate overhead is allocated to either of our reportable segments. Our chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of our segments and allocates resources to them based on adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ( Segment Adjusted EBITDA ).

  Executive Overview 
  Our Business 
  We are one of the nation s largest providers of post-acute healthcare services, offering both facility-based and home-based post-acute services in 34 states and Puerto Rico through our network of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, home health agencies, and hospice agencies. As discussed in this Item,  Segment Results of Operations,  we manage our operations using two operating segments which are also our reportable segments: (1) inpatient rehabilitation and (2) home health and hospice. For additional information about our business, see Item 1,   Business  , of the   2015 Form 10-K  . 
  Inpatient Rehabilitation 
  We are the nation s largest owner and operator of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals in terms of patients treated and discharged, revenues, and number of hospitals. We provide specialized rehabilitative treatment on both an inpatient and outpatient basis. While our national network of inpatient hospitals stretches across   30   states and Puerto Rico, we are concentrated in the eastern half of the United States and Texas. As of   September 30, 2016  , we operate   122   inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, including   one   hospital that operates as a joint venture which we account for using the equity method of accounting. In addition to HealthSouth hospitals, we manage   four   inpatient rehabilitation units through management contracts. Our inpatient rehabilitation segment represented approximately   81%   and   82%   of our   Net operating revenues   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 
  Home Health and Hospice 
  We are the nation s fourth largest provider of Medicare-certified skilled home health services. As of   September 30, 2016  , we provide home health and hospice services in   223   locations across   24   states. Two of these home health locations operate as joint ventures which we account for using the equity method of accounting. Our home health services include a comprehensive range of Medicare-certified home nursing services to adult patients in need of care. These services include, among others, skilled nursing, physical, occupational, and speech therapy, medical social work, and home health aide services. We also provide specialized home care services in Texas and Kansas for pediatric patients with severe medical conditions. Our hospice services primarily include in-home services to terminally ill patients and their families to address patients  physical needs, including pain control and symptom management, and to provide emotional and spiritual support. Our home health and hospice segment represented approximately   19%   and   18%   of our   Net operating revenues   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 
  As of March 31, 2016, all of HealthSouth s 25 legacy agencies, with the exception of one closing, had been integrated into Encompass Home Health and Hospice ( Encompass ), which we acquired on December 31, 2014, with 12 of those locations relocated or merged into existing Encompass locations. In addition, Encompass operates one of HealthSouth s integrated agencies as two locations.

2016 Overview 
  Our 2016 strategy focuses on the following priorities: 
             
    continuing to provide high-quality, cost-effective care to patients in our existing markets; 
                
    achieving organic growth at our existing hospitals, home health agencies, and hospice agencies; 
                
    expanding our services to more patients who require post-acute healthcare services by constructing and acquiring new hospitals in new markets and acquiring home health and hospice agencies in new markets; 
                
    continuing our shareholder value-enhancing strategies such as common stock dividends and repurchases of our common stock; and 
                
    positioning the Company for continued success in the evolving healthcare delivery system. This preparation includes continuing the installation of our electronic clinical information system in our hospitals which allows for interfaces with all major acute care electronic medical record systems and health information exchanges and participating in bundling projects and Accountable Care Organizations ( ACOs ). 
     During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   Net operating revenues   increased by   19.0%   and   20.7%   over the same periods of   2015   due primarily to our acquisitions of the operations of Reliant Hospital Partners, LLC and affiliated entities ( Reliant ) on October 1, 2015 and CareSouth Health System, Inc. ( CareSouth ) on November 2, 2015 (see Note 2,   Business Combinations  , to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the 2015 Form 10-K). 
  Within our inpatient rehabilitation segment, discharge growth of   12.6%   coupled with a   2.9%   increase in net patient revenue per discharge in the third quarter of 2016 generated   15.4%   growth in net patient revenue from our hospitals compared to the third quarter of 2015. Discharge growth included a   1.9%   increase in same-store discharges. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , discharge growth of   14.4%   coupled with a   2.3%   increase in net patient revenue per discharge generated   16.9%   growth in net patient revenue from our hospitals compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Discharge growth for the nine-month period included a   2.2%   increase in same-store discharges. Our inpatient rehabilitation quality and outcome measures, as reported through the Uniform Data System for Medical Rehabilitation (the  UDS ), remained well above the average for hospitals included in the UDS database. 
  Within our home health and hospice segment, home health admission growth of   50.7%   coupled with the impact of a   2.9%   decrease in revenue per episode in the third quarter of 2016 generated   37.9%   growth in home health and hospice revenue compared to the third quarter of 2015. Home health admission growth included a   15.3%   increase in same-store admissions. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , home health admission growth of 53.1% coupled with the impact of a 2.3% decrease in revenue per episode generated 41.4% growth in home health and hospice revenue compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Home health admission growth for the nine-month period included a 13.9% increase in same-store admissions. The quality of patient care star rating for our home health agencies continued to be well above the national average, as reported by the United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ). In addition, 30-day readmission rates at our home health agencies continued to be well below the national average, as reported by Avalere Health and the Alliance for Home Health Quality and Innovation. 
  Our growth efforts thus far in 2016 related to our inpatient rehabilitation segment have included the following: 
             
    began operating the 27-bed inpatient rehabilitation hospital at CHI St. Vincent Hot Springs, a Catholic Health Initiatives  hospital, in Hot Springs, Arkansas with our joint venture partner, St. Vincent Community Health Services, Inc, in February 2016. The joint venture completed construction of a new 40-bed hospital and began accepting patients on July 1, 2016; 
                
    entered into an agreement, in July 2016, with Novant Health, Inc. to file a certificate of need ( CON ) application to build a new 68-bed inpatient rehabilitation hospital in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The CON application requests that the rehabilitation unit currently located at the Novant Health Rehabilitation Center in Winston-Salem be relocated to the newly constructed hospital, once complete. Upon approval of the CON, the joint venture plans to begin construction on the new hospital; 
                
    entered into an agreement, in July 2016, with BJC HealthCare to file a CON application to build a 35-bed inpatient rehabilitation hospital on the third floor of BJC's Barnes-Jewish St. Peters Hospital located in St. Peters, Missouri. We were awarded a CON in September 2016 and expect construction of the new hospital to commence in the fourth quarter of 2016. Construction is expected to be completed in the summer of 2017, and the hospital  

36 

will serve as a satellite location of the Rehabilitation Institute of St. Louis, an existing inpatient rehabilitation hospital we jointly operate with BJC HealthCare; 
             
    began operating the 22-bed inpatient rehabilitation hospital at the Bernsen Rehabilitation Center at St. John, in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma with our joint venture partner, St. John Health System, in August 2016. The joint venture began construction of a new 40-bed hospital in August 2016, with construction expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2017; 
                
    began operating the new 49-bed inpatient rehabilitation hospital at CHI St. Joseph Health Rehabilitation Hospital in Bryan, Texas with our joint venture partner, St. Joseph s Health System, in August 2016; 
                
    entered into an agreement, in August 2016, with Tidelands Health to jointly own and operate the existing 29-bed inpatient rehabilitation hospital currently located on the campus of Tidelands Waccamaw Community Hospital in Murrells Inlet, South Carolina. The joint venture s operation of this hospital is expected to begin in 2018, and is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. In addition, the joint venture will build, own, and operate a second, 46-bed inpatient rehabilitation hospital in Little River, South Carolina. Construction of the new inpatient rehabilitation hospital is expected to begin in 2017, once the required state regulatory approvals are obtained; 
                
    continued our capacity expansions by adding 70 new beds to existing hospitals; and 
                
    continued development of the following de novo hospitals: 

(1)    In March 2016, we secured land and began the design and permitting process to build an inpatient rehabilitation hospital. 
   (2)    In June 2016, we were awarded a CON, acquired land, and began the design and permitting process to build an inpatient rehabilitation hospital. 
   (3)    In August 2014, we acquired land and began the design and permitting process to build an inpatient rehabilitation hospital. 
   (4)    In August 2016, we were awarded a CON, acquired land, and began the zoning, design, and permitting process to build an inpatient rehabilitation hospital. 
  We also continued our growth efforts in our home health and hospice segment, which have included the following: 
             
    acquired, in May 2016, Home Health Agency of Georgia, LLC., a home health and hospice provider with two home health locations and two hospice locations in the Greater Atlanta area; 
                
    began accepting patients at our new home health locations in Lee s Summit, Missouri in February 2016 and New Port Richey, Florida in May 2016; 
                
    acquired, in July 2016, Advantage Health Inc., a home health provider with one location in Yuma, Arizona; 
                
    acquired, in September 2016, three hospice agencies from Sotto International, Inc. located in Texarkana, Arkansas, Magnolia, Arkansas, and Texarkana, Texas; and 
                
    began accepting patients at our new hospice location in Lee s Summit, Missouri in July 2016. 

37 

In addition to our growth efforts, we took the following steps to further increase the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet.  
             
    In March and May 2016, we redeemed $50.0 million of the outstanding principal amount of our existing 7.75% Senior Notes due 2022 (the  2022 Notes ) using cash on hand and capacity under our revolving credit facility. Pursuant to the terms of these notes, these optional redemptions were made at a price of 103.875%, which resulted in a total cash outlay of approximately $104 million. 
                
    In September 2016, we redeemed the remaining outstanding principal   balance of     $76.0 million     of the 2022 Notes     using cash on hand and capacity under our revolving credit facility. Pursuant to the terms of these notes, this optional redemption was made at a price of   102.583%  , which resulted in a total cash outlay of approximately   $78 million  . 
     For additional information regarding these actions, see Note   5  ,   Long-term Debt  , to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1,   Financial Statements (Unaudited)  , of this report and the  Liquidity and Capital Resources  section of this Item. 
  We also continued our shareholder value-enhancing strategies by repurchasing 0.6 million shares of our common stock in the open market for approximately $22 million during the first and second quarters of 2016. In addition, we continued paying a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share on our common stock in the first three quarters of 2016. On July 21, 2016, our board of directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend and declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share, payable on October 17, 2016 to stockholders of record on October 3, 2016. See the  Liquidity and Capital Resources  section of this Item.  
  Business Outlook 
  We believe our business outlook remains positive for two primary reasons. First, demographic trends, such as population aging, should increase long-term demand for facility-based and home-based post-acute services. While we treat patients of all ages, most of our patients are 65 and older, and the number of Medicare enrollees is expected to grow approximately 3% per year for the foreseeable future. We believe the demand for facility-based and home-based post-acute services will continue to increase as the U.S. population ages and life expectancies increase. 
  Second, we are an industry leader in the growing post-acute sector. As the nation s largest owner and operator of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, we believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors based on our broad platform of clinical expertise, the quality of our clinical outcomes, the sustainability of best practices, and the application of rehabilitative technology. As the fourth largest provider of Medicare-certified skilled home health services, we believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors by virtue of our scale and density in the markets we serve, the application of a highly integrated technology platform, our ability to manage a variety of care pathways, and a proven track record of consummating and integrating acquisitions. 
  We have invested considerable resources into clinical and management systems and protocols that have allowed us to consistently produce high-quality outcomes for our patients while continuing to contain cost growth. Our proprietary hospital management reporting system aggregates data from each of our key business systems into a comprehensive reporting package used by the management teams in our hospitals, as well as executive management, and allows them to analyze data and trends and create custom reports on a timely basis. Our commitment to technology also includes the on-going implementation of our rehabilitation-specific electronic clinical information system. As of September 30, 2016, we had installed this system in 95 of our 122 hospitals. We believe this system will improve patient care and safety, enhance staff recruitment and retention, and set the stage for connectivity with other providers and health information exchanges. Our home health and hospice segment also uses information technology to enhance patient care and manage the business by utilizing Homecare Homebase   SM   , a comprehensive information platform that allows home health providers to process clinical, compliance, and marketing information as well as analyze data and trends for management purposes using custom reports on a timely basis. This allows our home health segment to manage the entire patient work flow and provide valuable data for health systems, payors, and ACO partners. We are currently the preferred home health provider to one ACO serving approximately 20,000 patients and are exploring several other participation opportunities. 
  We believe these factors align with our strengths in, and focus on, post-acute services. In addition, we believe we can address the demand for facility-based and home-based post-acute services in markets where we currently do not have a presence by constructing or acquiring new hospitals and by acquiring home health and hospice agencies in that highly fragmented industry. 

38 

Longer-term, the nature and timing of the transformation of the current healthcare system to coordinated care delivery and payment models is uncertain and will likely remain so for some time, as the development of new delivery and payment systems will almost certainly require significant time and resources. Furthermore, many of the alternative approaches being explored may not work as intended. However, as outlined in the 2015 Form 10-K (see Item 7,   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  ,  Executive Overview Key Challenges Changes to Our Operating Environment Resulting from Healthcare Reform ), our goal is to position the Company in a prudent manner to be responsive to industry shifts. We have invested in our core business and created an infrastructure that enables us to provide high-quality care on a cost-effective basis. We have been disciplined in creating a capital structure that is flexible with no significant debt maturities prior to 2020. Our balance sheet remains strong and includes a substantial portfolio of owned real estate. We have significant availability under our revolving credit facility, and we continue to generate strong cash flows from operations. Importantly, we have flexibility with how we choose to deploy our cash and create value for shareholders, including inpatient rehabilitation hospital bed expansions and de novos, acquisitions of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, home health agencies, and hospice agencies, repayments of long-term debt, common stock dividends, and repurchases of our common stock. While our financial leverage increased as a result of the acquisitions discussed in Note 2,   Business Combinations,   to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the   2015   Form 10-K, we anticipate in the longer term reducing our financial leverage based on growth of Adjusted EBITDA and an allocation of a portion of our free cash flow to debt reduction. 
  For these and other reasons, we believe we will be able to adapt to changes in reimbursement, sustain our business model, and grow through acquisition and consolidation opportunities as they arise. 
  Key Challenges 
  The healthcare industry is facing many well-publicized regulatory and reimbursement challenges. The industry is also facing uncertainty associated with the efforts, primarily arising from initiatives included in the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws (as defined in Item 1,   Business  ,  Regulatory and Reimbursement Challenges  of the 2015 Form 10 K) to identify and implement workable coordinated care delivery models. Successful healthcare providers are those who provide high-quality, cost-effective care and have the ability to adjust to changes in the regulatory and operating environments. We believe we have the necessary capabilities   scale, infrastructure, balance sheet, and management   to adapt to changes and continue to succeed in a highly regulated industry, and we have a proven track record of doing so. 
  As we continue to execute our business plan, the following are some of the challenges we face. 
             
    Operating in a Highly Regulated Industry  . We are required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local government levels. These rules and regulations have affected, or could in the future affect, our business activities by having an impact on the reimbursement we receive for services provided or the costs of compliance, mandating new documentation standards, requiring additional licensure or certification, regulating our relationships with physicians and other referral sources, regulating the use of our properties, and limiting our ability to enter new markets or add new capacity to existing hospitals and agencies. Ensuring continuous compliance with extensive laws and regulations is an operating requirement for all healthcare providers. 
     We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial time, effort, and expense in implementing and maintaining training programs as well as internal controls and procedures designed to ensure regulatory compliance, and we are committed to continued adherence to these guidelines. More specifically, because Medicare comprises a significant portion of our   Net operating revenues  , it is particularly important for us to remain compliant with the laws and regulations governing the Medicare program and related matters including anti-kickback and anti-fraud requirements. If we were unable to remain compliant with these regulations, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially, adversely impacted. 
  Concerns held by federal policymakers about the federal deficit and national debt levels could result in enactment of further federal spending reductions, further entitlement reform legislation affecting the Medicare program, or both, in 2016 and beyond. Additionally, many legislators in the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate continue to express the policy objective of modifying or repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (as subsequently amended, the  2010 Healthcare Reform Laws ). At this time, it is unclear what, if any, of the Medicare-related changes may ultimately be enacted and signed into law by the President, but it is possible that any reductions in Medicare spending will have a material impact on reimbursements for healthcare providers generally and post-acute providers specifically. We cannot predict what, if any, changes in Medicare spending or modifications to the healthcare laws and regulations will result from future budget and other legislative initiatives. 

39 

The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission ( MedPAC ) is an independent agency that advises Congress on issues affecting Medicare and makes payment policy recommendations to Congress and CMS for a variety of Medicare payment systems including, among others, the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system (the  IRF-PPS ), the home health prospective payment system (the  HH-PPS ) and the hospice prospective payment system (the  Hospice-PPS ). Congress and CMS are not obligated to adopt MedPAC recommendations, and, based on outcomes in previous years, there can be no assurance those recommendations will be adopted. However, MedPAC s recommendations have, and may in the future, become the basis for subsequent legislative or regulatory action.  
    
  In March 2016, MedPAC released recommendations to eliminate the market basket update for each of the IRF-PPS, the HH-PPS, and the Hospice-PPS for 2017. In another recommendation affecting IRFs, MedPAC suggested increasing the IRF-PPS outlier payment pool. Under the IRF-PPS, CMS effectively withholds 3% of payments due to providers to fund an outlier pool used to pay for patient treatments that are extraordinarily costly. MedPAC recommended the outlier pool be increased above its current 3% level. Any change in the outlier payment pool up to 5% could be done by CMS without legislative action. If implemented, this change would reduce the base Medicare payment to all IRF providers and redistribute payment to IRFs receiving a higher proportion of outlier payments. The final rule for the IRF-PPS discussed below did not follow MedPAC s recommendations to eliminate the market basket update or to increase the outlier pool.   
  On July 29, 2016, CMS released its notice of final rulemaking for fiscal year 2017 (the  2017 Rule ) for IRFs under the IRF-PPS. The final rule will implement a net 1.65% market basket increase effective for discharges between October 1, 2016 and September 30, 2017, calculated as follows: 
                 Market basket update 
    2.7% 
      Healthcare reform reduction 
    75 basis points 
      Productivity adjustment 
    30 basis points 

The final rule also includes other changes that impact our hospital-by-hospital base rate for Medicare reimbursement. Such changes include, but are not limited to, revisions to the wage index values, changes to designations between rural and urban facilities, and updates to the outlier fixed loss threshold. The final rule also continues the freeze to the update to the IRF-PPS facility-level rural adjustment factor, low-income patient factor, and teaching status adjustment factors. Based on our analysis which utilizes, among other things, the acuity of our patients over the 12-month period prior to the final rule s release and incorporates other adjustments included in the final rule, we believe the 2017 Rule will result in a net increase to our Medicare payment rates of approximately 1.9% effective October 1, 2016, prior to the impact of sequestration. 
  Additionally, the final rule contains changes that could affect us in future years. For example, CMS adopted five additional quality reporting measures, the reporting of which may require additional time and expense and could affect reimbursement beginning October 1, 2017.  
  Reimbursement claims made by healthcare providers, including inpatient rehabilitation hospitals as well as home health and hospice agencies, are subject to audit from time to time by governmental payors and their agents, such as the Medicare Administrative Contractors ( MACs ), fiscal intermediaries and carriers, as well as the Office of Inspector General, CMS, and state Medicaid programs. Under programs designated as  widespread probes,  certain of our MACs have conducted pre-payment claim reviews of our billings and denied payment for certain diagnosis codes. The majority of the denials we have encountered in these probes derive from one MAC. In connection with recent probes, this MAC has made determinations regarding medical necessity which represent its uniquely restrictive interpretations of the CMS coverage rules. We have discussed our objections to those interpretations with both the MAC and CMS. We cannot predict what, if any, changes will result from those discussions. If the MAC continues to deny a significant number of claims for certain diagnosis codes, we may experience increases in the   Provision for doubtful accounts  , decreases in cash flow as a result of increasing accounts receivable, and/or a shift in the patients and conditions we treat, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. 
  On November 16, 2015, CMS issued its final rule establishing the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement 
  ( CJR ) payment model. This mandatory model holds acute care hospitals accountable for the quality of care they deliver to Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries for lower extremity joint replacements (i.e., knees and hips) from surgery through recovery. Through the five-year payment model, which began on April 1, 2016, healthcare  

40 

providers in 67 geographic areas ( MSAs ) would continue to be paid under existing Medicare payment systems. However, the hospital where the joint replacement takes place would be held accountable for the quality and costs of care for the entire episode of care   from the time of the surgery through 90 days after discharge. Depending on the quality and cost performance during the entire episode, the hospital may receive an additional payment or be required to repay Medicare for a portion of the episode costs. As a result, the acute care hospitals would be incented to work with physicians and post-acute care providers to ensure beneficiaries receive the coordinated care they need in an efficient manner. We believe its impact would be positive for HealthSouth as it should favor high-quality, low-cost providers like us who have made significant commitments to information systems that enable and enhance connectivity. We also believe the rule further validates our movement into home health via the acquisition of Encompass. Currently, lower extremity joint replacement patients represent less than 8% of our total annual discharges due to our required compliance with the 60% rule. Given the 67 MSAs included in the CJR model, our patients potentially subject to this model represent approximately 2.1% of our annual Medicare discharges. The lower extremity joint replacement patients we do treat are generally higher acuity and bilateral or possess significant comorbidities. In these cases and in any risk-bearing bundling initiative, quality of outcomes is critical to achieving targeted financial results. 
  On July 25, 2016, CMS issued a proposed rule to establish a new mandatory payment bundling model for cardiac care and extend the existing bundled payment model for hip replacement to other hip surgeries. The program as proposed is generally similar to the CJR program described above, in that acute care hospitals would be at risk for patients  quality of care and Medicare expenditures incurred during their hospital stay and 90 days thereafter. CMS proposes to establish additional hip fracture bundles in the 67 MSAs (HealthSouth is located in 27 of these MSAs) where the CJR program is being implemented, and CMS proposes 294 potential MSAs for the cardiac bundle, of which 98 would be applied as part of the final rule. CMS proposes to begin the program in July 2017, and hospitals will have a gradual phasing-in of risk beginning in April 2018. Of the 294 potential MSAs included in the proposed model for cardiac cases, our hospitals are included in approximately 60 MSAs. If all of these 60 MSAs are selected as part of the final 98 MSAs for mandatory cardiac bundle, our patients potentially subject to this model represent approximately 1.0% of our annual Medicare discharges. Our patients potentially subject to the expanded portion of the hip replacement model represent approximately 1.2% of our annual Medicare discharges incremental to the above CJR program. Our analysis of this proposed rule and its potential impact on HealthSouth is ongoing. 
  On June 27, 2016, CMS released its notice of proposed rulemaking for calendar year 2017 for home health agencies under the HH-PPS. CMS estimates the rule will reduce Medicare payments to home health agencies by approximately 1.0% in 2017. Specifically, while the proposed rule provides for a market basket update of 2.8%, that update is offset by a 2.3% rebasing adjustment reduction (the last year of a four-year phase-in), a productivity adjustment reduction of 50 basis points, an outlier fixed dollar loss adjustment of 0.1%, and a coding intensity reduction of 0.9% (the second year of a three-year phase-in). We believe the proposed 2017 rule will result in a net decrease to Encompass  Medicare payment rates within a range of 3.0% to 4.0% effective for episodes ending in calendar year 2017. The net decrease to Encompass  Medicare payment rates is primarily impacted by an approximate 1.0% case mix re-weighting and approximately 1.0% to 2.0% for the change in the outlier calculation methodology. Additionally, we believe the proposed 2017 rule could have an approximate $1.5 million negative impact on revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016 applicable to episodes that begin in 2016 and end in 2017. 
  On June 8, 2016, CMS implemented a new pre-claim review demonstration of home health services in five states for a period of three years. Encompass operates in three of these states (Florida, Texas, and Massachusetts), which represents approximately 50% of their Medicare claims. Originally, the pre-claim demonstration was scheduled to begin in Florida no earlier than October 1, 2016, in Texas no earlier than December 1, 2016, and in Massachusetts no earlier than January 1, 2017. However, in September 2016, CMS announced there will be a delay in the start dates of the pre-claim demonstration for these states. The specific start dates have not been announced, but CMS will provide at least 30 days notice prior to beginning in any state. We expect the pre-claim review will result in an increase in Encompass  administrative costs. Additionally, once it commences we may experience temporary increases in the   Provision for doubtful accounts   and decreases in cash flow as a result of increasing accounts receivable, each of which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.

    Changes to Our Operating Environment Resulting from Healthcare Reform  . Our challenges related to healthcare reform are discussed in Item 1,   Business  ,  Sources of Revenues,  Item 1A,   Risk Factors  , and Item 7,   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  ,  Executive Overview Key Challenges,  to the 2015 Form 10-K. Many provisions within the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws have impacted, or could in the future impact, our business. Most notably for us are the reductions to our hospitals  annual market basket updates, including productivity adjustments, mandated reductions to home health and hospice Medicare reimbursements, and future payment reforms such as ACOs and bundled payments. 
     The healthcare industry in general is facing uncertainty associated with the efforts, primarily arising from initiatives included in the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws, to identify and implement workable coordinated care delivery models. In a coordinated care delivery model, hospitals, physicians, and other care providers work together to provide coordinated healthcare on a more efficient, patient-centered basis. These providers are then paid based on the overall value of the services they provide to a patient rather than the number of services they provide. While this is consistent with our goal and proven track record of being a high-quality, cost-effective provider, broad-based implementation of a new delivery model would represent a significant transformation for the healthcare industry. As the industry and its regulators explore this transformation, we are positioning the Company in preparation for whatever changes are ultimately made to the delivery system. We are currently participating in several coordinated care delivery model initiatives and are exploring ACO participation in several others. Eight of our IRFs began participating in Phase 2, the  at-risk  phase, of Model 3 of CMS  Bundled Payments for Care Improvement ( BPCI ) initiative in 2015. We also have several IRFs that have signed participation agreements with acute care providers participating in Model 2 of the BPCI initiative. Ten of our home health agencies began participating in Phase 2 of Model 3 of the BPCI initiative in April 2014. In July 2015, 42 additional home health agencies began participating in Phase 2 of Model 3 of this initiative. In addition, we have partnered as the home health provider with Premier PHC , an ACO serving approximately 20,000 Medicare patients. 
  Given the complexity and the number of changes in the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws and other pending regulatory initiatives, we cannot predict their ultimate impact. In addition, the ultimate nature and timing of the transformation of the healthcare delivery system is uncertain, and will likely remain so for some time. We will continue to evaluate these laws and regulations and position the Company for this industry shift. Based on our track record, we believe we can adapt to these regulatory and industry changes. Further, we have engaged, and will continue to engage, actively in discussions with key legislators and regulators to attempt to ensure any healthcare laws or regulations adopted or amended promote our goal of high-quality, cost-effective care. 
             
    Maintaining Strong Volume Growth  . Various factors, including competition, increasing regulatory and administrative burdens, and changes in the healthcare delivery system, may impact our ability to maintain and grow our hospital, home health, and hospice volumes. In any particular market, we may encounter competition from local or national entities with longer operating histories or other competitive advantages, such as acute care hospitals who provide post-acute services similar to ours or other post-acute providers with relationships with referring acute care hospitals or physicians. Aggressive payment review practices by Medicare contractors, aggressive enforcement of regulatory policies by government agencies, and restrictive or burdensome rules, regulations or statutes governing admissions practices may lead us to not accept patients who would be appropriate for and would benefit from the services we provide. In addition, from time to time, we must get regulatory approval to expand our services and locations in states with certificate of need laws. This approval may be withheld or take longer than expected. In the case of new-store volume growth, the addition of hospitals, home health agencies, and hospice agencies to our portfolio also may be difficult and take longer than expected. 
                
    Recruiting and Retaining High-Quality Personnel  . See Item 1A,   Risk Factors  , to the 2015 Form 10-K for a discussion of competition for staffing, shortages of qualified personnel, and other factors that may increase our labor costs. Recruiting and retaining qualified personnel for our inpatient hospitals and home health and hospice agencies remain a high priority for us. We attempt to maintain a comprehensive compensation and benefits package that allows us to remain competitive in this challenging staffing environment while remaining consistent with our goal of being a high-quality, cost-effective provider of post-acute services. 
     See also Item 1,   Business  , Item 1A,   Risk Factors  , and Item 7,   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  ,  Executive Overview Key Challenges,  to the 2015 Form 10 K. 

42 

These key challenges notwithstanding, we believe we have a strong business model, a strong balance sheet, and a proven track record of achieving strong financial and operational results. We are attempting to position the Company to respond to changes in the healthcare delivery system, and believe we will be in a position to take advantage of any opportunities that arise as the industry moves to this new stage. We believe we are positioned to continue to grow, adapt to external events, and create value for our shareholders in 2016 and beyond.  
   
  Results of Operations 
  Payor Mix 
  We derived consolidated   Net operating revenues   from the following payor sources: 

For additional information regarding our payors, see the  Sources of Revenues  section of Item 1,   Business  , of the   2015 Form 10-K  .  

43 

Our Results 
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our consolidated results of operations were as follows: 

44 

Provision for Doubtful Accounts and Operating Expenses as a % of Net Operating Revenues   

  In the discussion that follows, we use  same-store  comparisons to explain the changes in certain performance metrics and line items within our financial statements. We calculate same-store comparisons based on hospitals and agencies open throughout both the full current periods and prior periods presented. These comparisons include the financial results of market consolidation transactions in existing markets, as it is difficult to determine, with precision, the incremental impact of these transactions on our results of operations. 
  Net Operating Revenues 
  Our consolidated   Net operating revenues   increased   in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015 primarily from strong volume growth in both of our operating segments and included the effect of our acquisitions of Reliant on October 1, 2015 and CareSouth on November 2, 2015. See additional discussion in the  Segment Results of Operations  section of this Item. 
  Provision for Doubtful Accounts 
  Provision for doubtful accounts   increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015 primarily due to aging-based reserves resulting from continued administrative payment delays at our largest MAC. For additional information, see Item 1,   Business  ,  Sources of Revenues Medicare Reimbursement,  and Item 7,   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  ,  Results of Operations Our Results Provision for Doubtful Accounts,  to the 2015 Form 10-K. 
  Salaries and Benefits 
  Salaries and benefits   increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015 primarily due to increased patient volumes, including an increase in the number of full-time equivalents as a result of our 2015 development activities, the acquisitions of Reliant and CareSouth, and increases in merit and benefit costs. 
  Salaries and benefits   as a percent of   Net operating revenues   increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015, respectively, primarily as a result of merit and benefit cost increases, Medicare home health reimbursement rate cuts, and the ramping up of new hospitals in Franklin, Tennessee, Hot Springs, Arkansas, Bryan, Texas, and Broken Arrow, Oklahoma.  
  Salaries and benefits   are expected to increase in the fourth quarter of 2016 due to an approximate 2.75% merit increase provided to our nonmanagement hospital employees effective October 1, 2016. 
  Other Operating Expenses 
  Other operating expenses   increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015 primarily due to the acquisitions of Reliant and CareSouth and increased patient volumes at our hospitals.   Other operating expenses   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included the settlement of an employee sexual harassment matter that was not covered by insurance. 

45 

As a percent of   Net operating revenues  ,   Other operating expenses   decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015 primarily due to our increasing revenues, primarily as a result of the acquisitions of Reliant and CareSouth. As a percent of   Net operating revenues  ,   Other operating expenses   also decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 due to the aforementioned settlement. 
  Occupancy Costs 
  Occupancy costs   increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015 in terms of dollars and as a percent of   Net operating revenues   due to the acquisition of Reliant, which leased all of its hospitals. 
  Supplies 
  Supplies   increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015 due primarily to increased patient volumes.   Supplies   decreased as a percent of   Net operating revenues   during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015 primarily due to continued supply chain initiatives. 
  General and Administrative Expenses 
  General and administrative expenses   decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 due primarily to activity associated with stock-based compensation discussed in Note 14,   Employee Benefit Plans  , to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the 2015 Form 10-K, and transaction costs related to the acquisition of Reliant.   General and administrative expenses   decreased as a percent of   Net operating revenues   during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015 primarily due to our increasing revenues, primarily as a result of the acquisitions of Reliant and CareSouth. 
  Depreciation and Amortization 
  Depreciation and amortization   increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015 due to our capital expenditures and development activities throughout 2015 and 2016. 
  Government, Class Action, and Related Settlements 
  The loss included in   Government, Class Action, and Related Settlements   during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 resulted from a settlement discussed in Note 17,   Contingencies and Other Commitments  , to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the 2015 Form 10-K. 
  Professional Fees Accounting, Tax, and Legal 
  Professional Fees Accounting, Tax, and Legal   in each period presented related primarily to legal and consulting fees for continued litigation and support matters discussed in Note 17,   Contingencies and Other Commitments  , to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the 2015 Form 10-K. 
  Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt 
  The     Loss on early extinguishment of debt     during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016     resulted from the redemptions of our 2022 Notes in March, May, and September of 2016. 
  In January 2015, we issued an additional $400 million of our 5.75% Senior Notes due 2024 at a price of 102% of the principal amount and used $250 million of the net proceeds to repay borrowings under our term loan facilities, with the remaining net proceeds used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As a result of the term loan prepayment, we recorded a $1.2 million   Loss on early extinguishment of debt   in the first quarter of 2015.  
  In April 2015, we used the net proceeds from the offering of 5.125% Senior Notes due 2023 along with cash on hand to execute the redemption of our 8.125% Senior Notes due 2020. As a result of this redemption, we recorded an   $18.8 million     Loss on early extinguishment of debt     in the second quarter of 2015. 
  See Note   5  ,   Long-term Debt  , to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1,   Financial Statements (Unaudited)   and Note 8,   Long-term Debt  , to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the 2015 Form 10 K for additional information regarding these transactions. 

46 

Interest Expense and Amortization of Debt Discounts and Fees  
  The increase in   Interest expense and amortization of debt discounts and fees   during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015 resulted from an increase in average borrowings due to our use of debt to fund the acquisitions of Reliant and CareSouth. Our average cash interest rate remained relatively flat during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015. See Note   5  ,   Long-term Debt  , to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1,   Financial Statements (Unaudited)  , of this report and Note 8,   Long-term Debt  , to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the 2015 Form 10-K. 
  Other Income 
  Other income   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 included a $2.0 million gain related to the increase in fair value of our option to purchase up to a 5% equity interest in Surgical Care Affiliates ( SCA ), our former surgery centers division, from April 1, 2015 (the date it became exercisable) to April 13, 2015 (the date we exercised the option).   Other income   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 also included a $0.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively, realized gain from the sale of the SCA common stock. See Note 12,   Fair Value Measurements  , to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the 2015 Form 10-K. 
  Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Tax Expense 
  Our pre-tax income from continuing operations increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015 due to increased   Net operating revenues   as a result of our acquisitions of Reliant and CareSouth. 
  Provision for Income Tax Expense 
  We currently estimate our cash income tax expense t  o be approximately   $15 million   to   $30 million  , net of refunds, for 2016. These payments are expected to result from sta  te income tax expense of subsidiaries which have separate state filing requirements and federal income taxes based upon alternative minimum taxes, tax planning opportunities, the es  timate of the remaining federal NOL balance and the availability of other federal tax credits.   For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, current income tax expense was   $4.6 million   and   $3.5 million  , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, current income tax expense was   $13.6 million   and   $10.4 million  , respectively. 
  Our   Provision for income tax expense   in each period presented, primarily resulted from the application of our estimated effective blended federal and state income tax rate.  
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we filed an automatic tax accounting method change related to the deductibility of bad debts pursuant to the non-accrual experience method which resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $7 million. This change did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate. We also filed a non-automatic tax accounting method change related to billings denied under pre-payment claims reviews conducted by certain of our MACs and are awaiting acceptance by the IRS. If our request for the non-automatic tax accounting method change is accepted as filed, we anticipate additional tax benefits of approximately $50 million through September 30, 2016. Approximately $44 million of this amount represents pre-payment claims received in years prior to and including the year ending December 31, 2015. This change, if approved, is not expected to have a material impact on our effective tax rate. 
  In certain state jurisdictions, we do not expect to generate sufficient income to use all of the available NOLs prior to their expiration. This determination is based on our evaluation of all available evidence in these jurisdictions including results of operations during the preceding three years, our forecast of future earnings, and prudent tax planning strategies. It is possible we may be required to increase or decrease our valuation allowance at some future time if our forecast of future earnings varies from actual results on a consolidated basis or in the applicable state tax jurisdiction, or if the timing of future tax deductions differs from our expectations. 
  Excluding the potential impact of the non-automatic tax accounting method change discussed above, we expect our federal NOL to be exhausted by December 31, 2016. 
  We recognize the financial statement effects of uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, a position will be sustained upon examination by and resolution with the taxing authorities. Total remaining unrecognized tax benefits were   $2.8 million   and   $2.9 million   as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

  Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
  The increase in   Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests   during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 primarily resulted from increased profitability of our joint ventures. 
   
  Segment Results of Operations 
  Our internal financial reporting and management structure is focused on the major types of services provided by HealthSouth. We manage our operations using two operating segments which are also our reportable segments: (1) inpatient rehabilitation and (2) home health and hospice. For additional information regarding our business segments, including a detailed description of the services we provide, financial data for each segment, and a reconciliation of total segment Adjusted EBITDA to income from continuing operations before income tax expense, see Note   12  ,   Segment Reporting  , to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1,   Financial Statements (Unaudited)  , of this report. 
  Inpatient Rehabilitation 
  Our inpatient rehabilitation segment derived its   Net operating revenues   from the following payor sources: 

48 

Additional information regarding our inpatient rehabilitation segment s operating results for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is as follows: 

* 
    Excludes approximately 425 full-time equivalents for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and approximately 400 full-time equivalents for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 who are considered part of corporate overhead with their salaries and benefits included in   General and administrative expenses   in our consolidated statements of operations. Full-time equivalents included in the above table represent HealthSouth employees who participate in or support the operations of our hospitals and exclude an estimate of full-time equivalents related to contract labor. 
     We actively manage the productive portion of our   Salaries and benefits   utilizing certain metrics, including employees per occupied bed, or  EPOB.  This metric is determined by dividing the number of full-time equivalents, including an estimate of full-time equivalents from the utilization of contract labor, by the number of occupied beds during each period. The number of occupied beds is determined by multiplying the number of licensed beds by our occupancy percentage. 
  Net Operating Revenues 
  Net operating revenues   were   15.4%   higher during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same quarter of 2015. This increase included a   12.6%   increase in patient discharges and a   2.9%   increase in net patient revenue per discharge.  

49 

Discharge growth included a   1.9%   increase in same-store discharges. Discharge growth from new stores resulted from our acquisitions of Reliant (October 2015), our joint ventures in Hot Springs, Arkansas (February 2016), Bryan, Texas (August 2016), and Broken Arrow, Oklahoma (August 2016), and one wholly owned hospital that opened in Franklin, Tennessee (December 2015). Growth in net patient revenue per discharge benefited by approximately 60 basis points from an approximate $4 million Indirect Medical Education ( IME ) adjustment associated with the former Reliant hospital in Woburn, Massachusetts. Medicare provides that hospitals with residents in an approved graduate medical education program receive an additional payment for a Medicare discharge to reflect higher patient care costs of teaching hospitals relative to non-teaching hospitals. Our revenues for the third quarter of 2016 were positively impacted by this retroactive adjustment for 2014 and 2015, as well as the year-to-date period through July 2016. 
     Net operating revenues   were   16.9%   higher during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015. This increase included a   14.4%   increase in patient discharges and a   2.3%   increase in net patient revenue per discharge. Discharge growth included a   2.2%   increase in same-store discharges. Discharge growth and net patient revenue per discharge for the year-to-date period of 2016 were impacted by the same factors as discussed above for the third quarter of 2016. In addition, net patient revenue per discharge growth for the year-to-date period of 2016 benefited from an approximate $5 million Supplemental Security Income ( SSI ) adjustment that negatively impacted revenue in 2015. CMS periodically retroactively updates SSI ratios that are used to determine adjustments to Medicare payment rates for low-income patients. In the second quarter of 2015, CMS updated the ratios for fiscal year 2013, and we retroactively recorded adjustments to 2013, 2014, and year-to-date 2015. 
  Outpatient revenues increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015 due to the acquisition of Reliant. 
  See Note   2  ,   Business Combinations  , to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1,   Financial Statements (Unaudited)  , of this report for information regarding our joint ventures discussed above. See Note 2,   Business Combinations  , to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the 2015 Form 10-K for information regarding Reliant.

  The increase in Adjusted EBITDA during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same quarter of 2015 primarily resulted from revenue growth, as discussed above. All operating expenses as a percent of net operating revenues benefited in the third quarter of 2016 by the aforementioned IME adjustment.   Salaries and benefits   in the third quarter of 2016 included a year-over-year decline in group medical costs. Occupancy costs increased as a percent of net operating revenues due to the acquisition of Reliant. Bad debt expense as a percent of net operating revenues increased from 1.6% in the third quarter of 2015 to 1.8% in the third quarter of 2016 due to aging-based reserves resulting from continued administrative payment delays at the Company's largest Medicare Administrative Contractor. 
  The increase in Adjusted EBITDA during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulted from the same factors as discussed above for the third quarter of 2016 as well as a positive impact of $2.4 million in rebates associated with a contractual periodic pharmacy benefit reconciliation for 2014 and 2015. Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was negatively impacted by the aforementioned SSI adjustments and settlement of an employee sexual harassment matter that was not covered by insurance.

Home Health and Hospice 
  Our home health and hospice segment derived its   Net operating revenues   from the following payor sources: 

51 

Additional information regarding our home health and hospice segment s operating results for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is as follows: 

Net Operating Revenues 
  Home health and hospice revenue was   37.9%   higher during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same quarter of 2015. This increase included a   50.7%   increase in home health admissions and was impacted by a   2.9%   decrease in average revenue per episode. Home health admission growth included a   15.3%   increase in same-store admissions. Home health admission growth from new stores resulted from the acquisition of CareSouth and Encompass' other acquisitions throughout 2015. Average revenue per episode was impacted by the Medicare home health reimbursement rate cuts that became effective January 1, 2016 and lower revenue per episode at CareSouth due to patient mix. 
  Home health and hospice revenue was   41.4%   higher during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015. This increase included a   53.1%   increase in home health admissions and was impacted by a   2.3%   decrease in average revenue per episode. Home health admission growth included a 13.9% increase in same-store admissions. Home health admission growth from new stores and average revenue per episode resulted from the same factors discussed above for the third quarter of 2016. 

52 

See Note 2,   Business Combinations  , to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the 2015 Form 10-K for information regarding CareSouth and Encompass' other acquisitions throughout 2015. 
  Adjusted EBITDA 
  The increase in Adjusted EBITDA during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015 primarily resulted from revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was impacted by lower average revenue per episode, higher cost per visit driven by an increased percentage of therapy patients, merit and benefit costs increases, and expenses related to the integration of CareSouth. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flows from operations, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 
  The objectives of our capital structure strategy are to ensure we maintain adequate liquidity and flexibility. Pursuing and achieving those objectives allows us to support the execution of our operating and strategic plans and weather temporary disruptions in the capital markets and general business environment. Maintaining adequate liquidity is a function of our unrestricted   Cash and cash equivalents   and our available borrowing capacity. Maintaining flexibility in our capital structure is a function of, among other things, the amount of debt maturities in any given year, the options for debt prepayments without onerous penalties, and limiting restrictive terms and maintenance covenants in our debt agreements. 
  Consistent with these objectives, in March 2016  , we redeemed $50.0 million of the outstanding principal amount of our     existing 2022 Notes using cash on hand and   capacity under our revolving credit facility. Pursuant to the terms of the 2022 Notes, this optional redemption was made at a price of     103.875%  , which resulted in a total cash outlay of approximately     $52 million  . As a result of this redemption, we recorded a     $2.4 million     Loss on early extinguishment of debt     in the first quarter of 2016. 
  In May 2016, we redeemed an additional   $50 million   of the outstanding principal amount of our 2022 Notes using cash on hand and capacity under our revolving credit facility. Pursuant to the terms of the 2022 Notes, this optional redemption was also made at a price of   103.875%  , which resulted in a total cash outlay of approximately   $52 million  . As a result of this redemption, we   recorded a     $2.4 million     L  oss on early extinguishment of debt   in the second quarter of 2016. 
    In September 2016, we redeemed   the remaining outstanding principal balance of     $76.0 million     of the 2022 Notes using cash on hand and   capacity under our revolving credit facility.     Pursuant to the terms of the 2022 Notes, t  his optional redemption was made at a price of     102.583%  ,     which resulted in a total cash outlay of approximately   $78 million  . As a result of this redemption, we recorded a     $2.6 million     Loss on early extinguishment of debt     in the third quarter of 2016. 
  We have been disciplined in creating a capital structure that is flexible with no significant debt maturities prior to 2020. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have significant availability under our credit agreement. We continue to generate strong cash flows from operations, and we have significant flexibility with how we choose to invest our cash and return capital to shareholders. While our financial leverage increased as a result of the Reliant and CareSouth transactions, we anticipate in the longer term reducing our financial leverage based on growth of Adjusted EBITDA and an allocation of a portion of our free cash flow to debt reduction. 
  For additional information regarding our indebtedness, see Note   5  ,   Long-term Debt  , to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1,   Financial Statements (Unaudited)  , of this report and Note 8,   Long-term Debt,   to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the   2015   Form 10-K. 
  Current Liquidity 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had     $76.4 million     in   Cash and cash equivalents  .   Cash and cash equivalents   as of   September 30, 2016   excluded $  52.9   million in restricted cash (included in   Other current assets  ) and $  57.5   million of restricted marketable securities   (  $24.2 million     included in   Other current assets     and     $33.3 million     i  ncluded in   Other long-term assets  ). Our restricted assets pertain primarily to obligations associated with our captive insurance company, as well as obligations we have under agreements with joint venture partners. See Note 3,   Cash and Marketable Securities  , to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the   2015   Form 10-K. 
  In addition to   Cash and cash equivalents  , as of   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately $417 million available to us under our revolving credit facility. Our credit agreement governs the substantial majority of our senior secured borrowing capacity and contains a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio as financial covenants. Our leverage ratio is defined in our  

53 

credit agreement as the ratio of consolidated total debt (less up to $75 million of cash on hand) to Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing four quarters. In calculating the leverage ratio under our credit agreement, we are permitted to use pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, the calculation of which includes historical income statement items and pro forma adjustments resulting from (1) the dispositions and repayments or incurrence of debt and (2) the investments, acquisitions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations and operational changes from acquisitions to the extent such items or effects are not yet reflected in our trailing four-quarter financial statements. Our interest coverage ratio is defined in our credit agreement as the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense, excluding the amortization of financing fees, for the trailing four quarters. As of   September 30, 2016  , the maximum leverage ratio requirement per our credit agreement was 4.5x and the minimum interest coverage ratio requirement was 3.0x, and we were in compliance with these covenants. Based on Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing four quarters and the interest rate in effect under our credit agreement during the three-month period ended   September 30, 2016  , if we had drawn on the first day and maintained the maximum amount of outstanding draws under our revolving credit facility for that entire period, we would still be in compliance with the maximum leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio requirements. 
  We do not face near-term refinancing risk, as the amounts outstanding under our credit agreement do not mature until 2020, and our bonds all mature in 2023 and beyond. See the  Contractual Obligations  section below for information related to our contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  We anticipate we will continue to generate strong cash flows from operations that, together with availability under our revolving credit facility, will allow us to invest in growth opportunities and continue to improve our existing business. We also will continue to consider additional shareholder value-enhancing strategies such as repurchases of our common stock and   distribution of   common stock dividends, including the potential growth of the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock, recognizing that these actions may increase our leverage ratio. See also the  Authorizations for Returning Capital to Stakeholders  section of this Item. 
  See Item 1A,   Risk Factors  , of the   2015   Form 10-K for a discussion of risks and uncertainties facing us. 
  Sources and Uses of Cash 
  The following table shows the cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing, and financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in millions): 

Operating activities  .     The increase in     Net cash provided by operating activities     for the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2016     compared to the same period of 2015 primarily resulted f  rom revenue growth, as described above, and lower working capital primarily attributable to payroll-related liabilities. 
  Investing activities  . The decrease in     Net cash used in investing activities     during the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2016     compared to the same period of     2015     primarily resulted from our 2015 development activities as described in Note 2,   Business Combinations  , to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the   2015   Form 10-K and proceeds received from the sale of common stock in Surgical Care Affiliates (our former surgery centers division) in 2015. 
  Financing activities  .     Net cash used in financing activities     during the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2016     primarily resulted from     net   debt payments, including the redemption of  $176 million of the 2022 Notes, as discussed above, cash dividends on common stock, distributions paid to noncontrolling interests of consolidated affiliates, and repurchases of our common stock.   Net cash provided by financing activities     during the     nine     months ended September 30, 2015 included net debt issuances as discussed     in Note 8,   Long-term Debt  , to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the   2015   Form 10-K, offset by cash dividends on common stock and distributions paid to noncontrolling interests of consolidated affiliates. 

54 

Contractual Obligations 
  Our consolidated contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016   are as follows (in millions): 

(a)   
    Included in long-term debt are amounts owed on our bonds payable and other notes payable. These borrowings are further explained in Note   5  ,   Long-term Debt  , to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1,   Financial Statements (Unaudited)  , of this report and Note 8,   Long-term Debt,   to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the   2015 Form 10-K  . 
               (b)   
    Interest on our fixed rate debt is presented using the stated interest rate. Interest expense on our variable rate debt is estimated using the rate in effect as of   September 30, 2016  . Interest pertaining to our credit agreement and bonds is included to their respective ultimate maturity dates. Interest related to capital lease obligations is excluded from this line. Future minimum payments, which are accounted for as interest, related to sale/leaseback transactions involving real estate accounted for as financings are included in this line (see Note 5,   Property and Equipment  , and Note 8,   Long-term Debt  , to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the   2015 Form 10-K  ). Amounts exclude amortization of debt discounts, amortization of loan fees, or fees for lines of credit that would be included in interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations. 
               (c)   
    Amounts include interest portion of future minimum capital lease payments. 
               (d)   
    Our inpatient rehabilitation segment leases approximately 16% of its hospitals as well as other property and equipment under operating leases in the normal course of business. Our home health and hospice segment leases relatively small office spaces in the localities it serves, space for its corporate office, and other equipment under operating leases in the normal course of business. Some of our hospital leases contain escalation clauses based on changes in the Consumer Price Index while others have fixed escalation terms. The minimum lease payments do not include contingent rental expense. Some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements. For more information, see Note 5,   Property and Equipment,   to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the   2015 Form 10-K  . 
               (e)   
    Future operating lease obligations and purchase obligations are not recognized in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
               (f)   
    Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on HealthSouth and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Our purchase obligations primarily relate to software licensing and support. 
               (g)   
    Because their future cash outflows are uncertain, the following noncurrent liabilities are excluded from the table above: general liability, professional liability, and workers' compensation risks, noncurrent amounts related to third-party billing audits, and deferred income taxes. Also, as of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $2.8 million   of total gross  

55 

unrecognized tax benefits. For more information, see Note 9,   Self-Insured Risks,   Note 15,   Income Taxes,   and Note 17,   Contingencies and Other Commitments,   to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the   2015 Form 10-K   and Note   9  ,   Income Taxes  , to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1,   Financial Statements (Unaudited)  , of this report. 
            (h)   
    The table above does not include   Redeemable noncontrolling interests   of   $109.4 million   because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing and amounts of any related cash outflows. 
     Our capital expenditures include costs associated with our hospital refresh program, de novo projects, capacity expansions, technology initiatives, and building and equipment upgrades and purchases. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we made capital expenditures of approximately   $131.4 million   for property and equipment and capitalized software. During 2016, we expect to spend approximately $185 million to $225 million for capital expenditures. Approximately $95 million to $105 million of this budgeted amount is considered nondiscretionary expenditures, which we may refer to in other filings as  maintenance  expenditures. Actual amounts spent will be dependent upon the timing of construction projects and acquisition opportunities for our home health and hospice business. 
  Authorizations for Returning Capital to Stakeholders 
  In October 2015, February 2016, and May 2016, our board of directors declared cash dividends of   $0.23   per share that were paid in January 2016, April 2016, and July 2016, respectively. On July 21, 2016, our board of directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend and declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share, payable on October 17, 2016 to stockholders of record on October 3, 2016. On October 20, 2016, our board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share, payable on January 17, 2017 to stockholders of record on January 3, 2017. We expect quarterly dividends to be paid in January, April, July, and October. However, the actual declaration of any future cash dividends, and the setting of record and payment dates as well as the per share amounts, will be at the discretion of our board of directors after consideration of various factors, including our capital position and alternative uses of funds. Cash dividends are expected to be funded using cash flows from operations, cash on hand, and availability under our revolving credit facility. 
  The payment of cash dividends on our common stock triggers antidilution adjustments, except in instances when such adjustments are deemed   de minimis  , under our convertible notes. See Note 8,   Long-term Debt   to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the   2015 Form 10-K   and Note   10  ,   Earnings per Common Share  , to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1,   Financial Statements (Unaudited)  , of this report. 
  On February 14, 2014, our board of directors approved an increase in our existing common stock repurchase authorization from $200 million to $250 million. As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately $137 million remained under this authorization. The repurchase authorization does not require the repurchase of a specific number of shares, has an indefinite term, and is subject to termination at any time by our board of directors. Subject to certain terms and conditions, including a maximum price per share and compliance with federal and state securities and other laws, the repurchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, or other transactions, including trades under a plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. During the first and second quarters of 2016, we repurchased 0.6 million shares of our common stock in the open market for approximately $22 million under this repurchase authorization using cash on hand. Future repurchases under this authorization generally are expected to be funded using a combination of cash on hand and availability under our $600 million revolving credit facility. 
  Adjusted EBITDA 
  Management believes Adjusted EBITDA as defined in our credit agreement is a measure of our ability to service our debt and our ability to make capital expenditures. We reconcile Adjusted EBITDA to   Net income   and to   Net cash provided by operating activities  . 
  We use Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis as a liquidity measure. We believe this financial measure on a consolidated basis is important in analyzing our liquidity because it is the key component of certain material covenants contained within our credit agreement, which is discussed in more detail in Note 8,   Long-term Debt  , to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the   2015   Form 10-K. These covenants are material terms of the credit agreement. Noncompliance with these financial covenants under our credit agreement our interest coverage ratio and our leverage ratio could result in our lenders requiring us to immediately repay all amounts borrowed. If we anticipated a potential covenant violation, we would seek relief from our lenders, which would have some cost to us, and such relief might be on terms less  favorable to us than those in our existing credit agreement. In addition, if we cannot satisfy these financial covenants, we would be prohibited under our credit agreement from engaging in certain activities, such as incurring additional indebtedness, paying  

56 

common stock dividends, making certain payments, and acquiring and disposing of assets. Consequently, Adjusted EBITDA is critical to our assessment of our liquidity. 
  In general terms, the credit agreement definition of Adjusted EBITDA, therein referred to as  Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA,  allows us to add back to consolidated   Net income   interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization and then add back to consolidated   Net income   (1) all unusual or nonrecurring items reducing consolidated   Net income   (of which only up to $10 million in a year may be cash expenditures), (2) any losses from discontinued operations and closed locations, (3) costs and expenses, including legal fees and expert witness fees, incurred with respect to litigation associated with stockholder derivative litigation, and (4) share-based compensation expense. We also subtract from consolidated   Net income   all unusual or nonrecurring items to the extent they increase consolidated   Net income  . 
  Under the credit agreement, the Adjusted EBITDA calculation does not include net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and includes (1) gain or loss on disposal of assets, (2) professional fees unrelated to the stockholder derivative litigation, (3) unusual or nonrecurring cash expenditures in excess of $10 million, and (4) pro forma adjustments resulting from debt transactions and development activities. Items falling within the credit agreement s  unusual or nonrecurring  classification may occur in future periods, but these items and amounts recognized can vary significantly from period to period and may not directly relate to our ongoing operations. Accordingly, these items may not be indicative of our ongoing performance, so the Adjusted EBITDA calculation presented here includes adjustments for them. 
  Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, and the items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for   Net income   or cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Revenues and expenses are measured in accordance with the policies and procedures described in Note 1,   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  , to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the   2015   Form 10-K. 
  Our Adjusted EBITDA for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was as follows (in millions): 
  Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA 

57 

Reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Adjusted EBITDA 

Growth in Adjusted EBITDA in   2016   compared to   2015   resulted primarily from revenue growth in both segments due to the acquisitions of Reliant and CareSouth as well as our other 2015 development activities. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  For information regarding recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1,   Basis of Presentation  , to our 
  condensed consolidated financial statements included under Part I, Item 1,   Financial Statements (Unaudited)  , of this 
  report. 
   
           Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
     Our primary exposure to market risk is to changes in interest rates on our variable rate long-term debt. We use sensitivity analysis models to evaluate the impact of interest rate changes on our variable rate debt. As of   September 30, 2016  , our primary variable rate debt outstanding related to   $150.0 million   in advances under our revolving credit facility and   $426.8 million   outstanding under our term loan facilities. Assuming outstanding balances were to remain the same, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in an incremental negative cash flow of approximately $5.2 million over the next 12 months, while a 1% decrease in interest rates would result in an incremental positive cash flow of approximately $3.2 million over the next 12 months, assuming floating rate indices are floored at 0%. 
  See Note   5  ,   Long-term Debt  , and Note   7  ,   Fair Value Measurements  , to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1,   Financial Statements (Unaudited)  , of this report, for additional information regarding our long-term debt.

           Item 2. 
    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
     Purchases of Equity Securities 
  The following table summarizes our repurchases of equity securities during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

(1)   
    Except as noted in the following sentence, the number of shares reported in this column includes the shares purchased under the plan or program as reported in the third column of this table and the shares tendered by employees as payments of the tax liabilities incident to the vesting of previously awarded shares of restricted stock and the exercise price and tax liability incident to the net settlement of an option exercise. In July, 1,030 shares were purchased pursuant to our Directors  Deferred Stock Investment Plan. This plan is a nonqualified deferral plan allowing non-employee directors to make advance elections to defer a fixed percentage of their director fees. The plan administrator acquires the shares in the open market which are then held in a rabbi trust. The plan provides that dividends paid on the shares held for the accounts of the directors will be reinvested in shares of our common stock which will also be held in the trust. The directors  rights to all shares in the trust are nonforfeitable, but the shares are only released to the directors after departure from our board. 
               (2)   
    On October 28, 2013, we announced our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of our common stock. On February 14, 2014, our board of directors approved an increase in this common stock repurchase authorization from $200 million to $250 million. The repurchase authorization does not require the repurchase of a specific number of shares, has an indefinite term, and is subject to termination at any time by our board of directors. Subject to certain terms and conditions, including a maximum price per share and compliance with federal and state securities and other laws, the repurchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, or other transactions, including trades under a plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Dividends 
  On October 15, 2013, we paid the first cash dividend, $0.18 per share, on our common stock, and we paid the same per share dividend quarterly through July 15, 2014. On July 17, 2014, our board of directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend and declared a cash dividend of $0.21 per share on our common stock that was paid on October 15, 2014, and we paid the same per share quarterly dividend through July 15, 2015. On July 16, 2015, our board of directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend and declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share that was paid on October 15, 2015, and we have paid the same per share quarterly dividend through July 15, 2016. On July 21, 2016, our board of directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend and declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share, payable on October 17, 2016 to stockholders of record on October 3, 2016. On October 20, 2016, our board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share, payable on January 17, 2017 to stockholders of record on January 3, 2017. We expect quarterly dividends to continue to be paid in January, April, July, and October. However, the actual declaration of any future cash dividends, and the setting of record and payment dates as well as the per share amounts, will be at the discretion of our board each quarter after consideration of various factors, including our capital position and alternative uses of funds. 
  The terms of our credit agreement allow us to declare and pay cash dividends on our common stock so long as: (1) we are not in default under our credit agreement and (2) our senior secured leverage ratio remains less than or equal to 1.75x. The terms of our senior note indenture allow us to declare and pay cash dividends on our common stock so long as (1) we are not in default, (2) the consolidated coverage ratio (as defined in the indenture) exceeds 2x or we are otherwise allowed under the indenture to incur debt, and (3) we have capacity under the indenture s restricted payments covenant to declare and pay dividends. We believe we currently have adequate capacity under these covenants to pursue the dividend strategy described in this report for the foreseeable future based on the capacity as of the date of this report and anticipated restricted payments. See Note   5  ,   Long-term Debt  , to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1,   Financial Statements (Unaudited)  , of this report and Note 8,   Long-term Debt  , to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the   2015   Form 10-K.

    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              (a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              (b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and

    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              (a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              (b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
