 Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
 Organization and Nature of Operations  
 First Priority Financial Corp.  
 First Priority Financial Corp. ( First Priority,  the  Company ) is a bank holding company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on February 13, 2007. On May 11, 2007, as a result of a reorganization and merger, First Priority Bank (the  Bank ) became a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Priority.  First Priority, primarily through the Bank, serves residents and businesses in the Delaware Valley with branches in Berks, Bucks, Chester and Montgomery counties in Pennsylvania.  The Bank, which has seven retail branch office locations, is a locally managed community bank providing commercial banking products, primarily loans and deposits, headquartered in Malvern, PA.  
 First Priority provides banking services through the Bank and does not engage in any activities other than banking and related activities. As of September 30, 2016, First Priority had total assets of $572.0 million and total shareholders  equity of $47.6 million.  
 First Priority Bank  
 The Bank is a state-chartered commercial banking institution which was incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on May 25, 2005. First Priority Bank s deposits are insured by the FDIC up to the maximum amount permitted for all banks.   
 The Bank engages in a full service commercial and consumer banking business with strong private banking and individual wealth management services. The Bank offers a variety of consumer, private banking and commercial loans, mortgage products and commercial real estate financing. The Company s operations are significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions, competition, and the monetary, fiscal, and regulatory policies of governmental agencies. Lending activities are influenced by a number of factors, including the general credit needs of individuals and small and medium-sized businesses in the Company s market area, competition, the current regulatory environment, the level of interest rates, and the availability of funds. Deposit flows and costs of funds are influenced by prevailing market rates of interest, competition, account maturities, and the level of personal income and savings in the market area.  
 The Bank also offers certain financial planning and investment management services. These investment services are provided by First Priority Financial Services, a Division of First Priority Bank, through an agreement with a third party provider. In addition, various life insurance products are offered through the Bank, and the Bank has also entered into solicitation agreements with several investment advisors to provide portfolio management services to customers of the Bank.  
 The Bank currently seeks deposits and commercial and private banking relationships through its seven banking offices. The Bank provides deposit products that include checking, money market and savings accounts, and certificates of deposit as well as other deposit services, including cash management electronic banking and mobile products as well as online account opening capabilities. The Bank obtains funding in the local community by providing excellent service and competitive rates to its customers and utilizes various advertising to attract current and potential deposit customers. The Bank also uses brokered certificates of deposit as a cost effective funding alternative.  
 Basis of Presentation  
 The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements consist of the Company and the Company s wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, the Bank.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 These statements are prepared in accordance with instructions to Form 10-Q, and therefore, do not include information or all footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). However, all normal recurring adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of these financial statements have been included. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for First Priority Financial Corp. for the year ended December 31, 2015, included in the Company s Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 25, 2016. The results of interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.

Subsequent Events   
 Management has evaluated events and transactions occurring subsequent to September 30, 2016 for items that should potentially be recognized or disclosed in these Consolidated Financial Statements. The evaluation was conducted through the date these financial statements were issued. 
 Estimates  
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, stock-based compensation, impairment of goodwill, impairment of investments, the valuation of deferred tax assets and the valuation of other real estate owned.  
 Acquired Loans  
 Acquired loans are initially recorded at their acquisition date fair values. The carryover of allowance for loan losses is prohibited as any credit losses in the loans are included in the determination of the fair value of the loans at the acquisition date. Fair values for acquired loans are based on a discounted cash flow methodology that involves assumptions and judgments as to credit risk, prepayment risk, liquidity risk, default rates, loss severity, payment speeds, collateral values and discount rate.  
 Acquired loans that have evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination and for which it is probable, at acquisition, that the Company will be unable to collect all contractually required payments are accounted for as impaired loans under ASC 310-30. The excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable discount and is recognized into interest income over the remaining life of the loans. The difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the non-accretable discount. The non-accretable discount represents estimated future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loan. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows require the Company to evaluate the need for an allowance for loan losses on these loans. Subsequent improvements in expected cash flows result in the reversal of a corresponding amount of the non-accretable discount which the Company then reclassifies as an accretable discount that is recognized into interest income over the remaining life of the loans using the interest method.  As of September 30, 2016 there were three remaining acquired purchased credit impaired loans with a net recorded balance of $225 thousand, after a non-accretable credit discount of $362 thousand.  
 Acquired loans that met the criteria for non-accrual of interest prior to acquisition may be considered performing upon acquisition, or in the future, regardless of whether the customer is contractually delinquent, if the Company can reasonably estimate the timing and amount of the expected cash flows on such loans and if the Company expects to fully collect the new carrying value of the loans. As such, the Company may no longer consider the loan to be non-accrual or non-performing and may accrue interest on these loans, including the impact of any accretable discount. For acquired loans that are not deemed impaired at acquisition, credit discounts representing the principal losses expected over the life of the loan are a component of the initial fair value and amortized over the life of the asset. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the methods utilized to estimate the required allowance for loan losses for these loans is similar to originated loans, however, the Company records a provision for loan losses only when the required allowance exceeds any remaining pooled discounts for loans evaluated collectively for impairment. As of September 30, 2016, the net recorded balance of acquired loans resulting from the Affinity merger totaled $16.3 million, including a remaining interest rate fair value adjustment of $23 thousand offset by a remaining accretable credit discount of $34 thousand, both of which are being recognized into interest income over the remaining life of the loans.  The Company also purchased portfolios of performing residential real estate loans during 2014 through 2016, all of which and were underwritten using similar underwriting standards as it uses for its organic portfolio.  These combined portfolios totaled $30.7 million as of September 30, 2016, with remaining acquisition premiums of $601 thousand that will be recognized into interest income over the remaining life of the loans.  In August 2016, the Company purchased $64.4 million of performing commercial loans from within the Bank s market area which, as of September 30, 2016, totaled $63.1 million with remaining acquisition premiums of $179 thousand.

Allowance for Loan Losses   
 The allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction to loans. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments, totaling $35 thousand as of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, represents management s estimate of losses inherent in its unfunded loan commitments and is recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses, and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. All, or part, of the principal balance of loans receivable are charged off to the allowance as soon as it is determined that the repayment of all, or part, of the principal balance is highly unlikely. Because all identified losses are immediately charged off, no portion of the allowance for loan losses is restricted to any individual loan or groups of loans, and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all loan losses.  
 The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated. Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance. The allowance is based on the Company s past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and other relevant factors.  This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.  
 The allowance consists of specific, general and unallocated components. The specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. For loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers pools of loans by loan class including commercial loans not considered impaired, as well as smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as residential real estate, home equity and other consumer loans. These pools of loans are evaluated for loss exposure based upon historical loss rates for each of these categories of loans, adjusted for qualitative factors. These qualitative risk factors include:  

1.   
 
 Lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices.     

2.   
 
 National, regional, and local economic and business conditions as well as the condition of various market segments, including the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans.     

3.   
 
 Nature and volume of the portfolio and terms of loans.     

4.   
 
 Management team with experience, depth, and knowledge in banking and in many areas of lending. Each contributes to the sound credit culture and control within the Company.     

5.   
 
 Volume and severity of past due, classified and nonaccrual loans as well as other loan modifications.     

6.   
 
 The Company engages a third party to perform an independent review of the loan portfolio as a measure for quality and consistency in credit evaluation and credit decisions.     

7.   
 
 Existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations.     

8.   
 
 Effect of external factors, such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements.     

 Each factor is assigned a value to reflect improving, stable or declining conditions based on management s best judgment using relevant information available at the time of the evaluation. Adjustments to the factors are supported through documentation of changes in conditions in a narrative accompanying the allowance for loan loss calculation.  
 A majority of the Company s loans are to business owners of many types. The Company makes commercial loans for real estate development and other business purposes required by our customers.  
 The Company s credit policies determine advance rates against the different forms of collateral that can be pledged against commercial loans. Typically, the majority of loans will be limited to a percentage of their underlying collateral values such as real estate values, equipment, eligible accounts receivable and inventory. Individual loan advance rates may be higher or lower depending upon the financial strength of the borrower and/or term of the loan. The assets financed through commercial loans are used within the business for its ongoing operation. Repayment of these kinds of loans generally comes from the cash flow of the business or the ongoing conversions of assets. Commercial real estate loans include long-term loans financing commercial properties. Repayment of this kind of loan is dependent upon either the ongoing cash flow of the borrowing entity or the resale of or lease of the subject property. Commercial real estate loans typically require a loan to value ratio of not greater than 80% and vary in terms.  
   
 9 

Residential mortgages and home equity loans are secured by the borrower s residential real estate in either a first or second lien position. Residential mortgages and home equity loans have varying loan rates depending   on the financial condition of the borrower and the loan to value ratio. Residential mortgages have amortizations up to 30 years and home equity loans have maturities of no more than 15 years.  Residential mortgages and home equity loans typically require   a loan to value ratio of not greater than 80%.    
 Other consumer loans include installment loans, car loans, and overdraft lines of credit. The majority of these loans are secured.  
 An unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management s estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio.  
 A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed.  Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  An allowance for loan losses is established for an impaired loan if its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The estimated fair values of substantially all of the Company s impaired loans are measured based on the estimated fair value of the loan s collateral.  
 For commercial loans secured by real estate, estimated fair values are determined primarily through third-party appraisals. When a real estate secured loan becomes impaired, a decision is made regarding whether an updated certified appraisal of the real estate is necessary. This decision is based on various considerations, including the age of the most recent appraisal, the loan-to-value ratio based on the original appraisal and the condition of the property. Appraised values may be discounted to arrive at the estimated selling price of the collateral, which is considered to be the estimated fair value. The discounts also include estimated costs to sell the property.  
 For commercial and industrial loans secured by non-real estate collateral, such as accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, estimated fair values are determined based on the borrower s financial statements, inventory reports, accounts receivable aging or equipment appraisals or invoices. Indications of value from these sources are generally discounted based on the age of the financial information or the quality of the assets.  
 The allowance calculation methodology includes further segregation of loan classes into risk rating categories. The borrower s overall financial condition, repayment sources, guarantors and value of collateral, if appropriate, are evaluated annually for commercial loans or when credit deficiencies arise, such as delinquent loan payments, for commercial and consumer loans. Credit quality risk ratings include regulatory classifications of special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss. Loans criticized special mention have potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If uncorrected, the potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects. Loans classified substandard have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They include loans that are inadequately protected by the current sound net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in loans classified substandard with the added characteristic that collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of current conditions and facts, is highly improbable. Loans classified as a loss are considered uncollectible and are charged to the allowance for loan losses. Loans not classified are rated pass.  
 In addition, Federal regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company s allowance for loan losses and may require the Company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination, which may not be currently available to management. Based on management s comprehensive analysis of the loan portfolio, management believes the current level of the allowance for loan losses is adequate.  
 Comprehensive Income  
 Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that recognized revenue, expenses, gains and losses be included in net income. Although certain changes in assets and liabilities are reported as a separate component of the shareholders  equity section of the balance sheet, such items, along with net income, are components of total comprehensive income.

Total reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive   income for the periods presented are as follows:  

Accumulated other comprehensive income as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consisted of the following: 

Note 2 Recently Issued Accounting Standards  
 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, deferred by ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The amendments in this Update establish a comprehensive revenue recognition standard for virtually all industries under U.S. GAAP, including those that previously followed industry specific guidance such as the real estate, construction and software industries. The revenue standard s core principle is built on the contract between a vendor and a customer for the provision of goods and services. It attempts to depict the exchange of rights and obligations between the parties in the pattern of revenue recognition based on the consideration to which the vendor is entitled. To accomplish this objective, the standard requires five basic steps: i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The amendments are effective for annual periods, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. Management does not believe the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have a significant impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements but will continue to evaluate.  
 In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-01,  Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  ( ASU 2016-01 ). ASU 2016-01 changes current U.S. GAAP for public entities by requiring the following, among others: (1) equity securities, except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; (2) the use of the exit price when measuring fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; (3) an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value; and (4) separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or notes to the financial statements. ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-01 will have on future financial statements and disclosures.    
 In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-02,  Leases.  From the lessee's perspective, the new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement for a lessee. From the lessor's perspective, the new standard requires a lessor to classify leases as either sales-type, finance or operating. A lease will be treated as a sale if it transfers all of the risks and rewards, as well as control of the underlying asset, to the lessee. If risks and rewards are conveyed without the transfer of control, the lease is treated as a financing. If the lessor doesn t convey risks and rewards or control, an operating lease results. The  
   
 11 

new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition appr  oach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. A modified retrospective   transition approach is required for lessors for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients   available. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements  .  
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  This ASU simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  For public business entities, this ASU is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein.  The Company is evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326).  The main objective of this Update is to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date.  The amendments in this Update replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.  For public business entities, this ASU is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods therein.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   This ASU clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented in the statement of cash flows.  This update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice.  For public business entities this ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
 Note 3 Earnings Per Common Share  
 Diluted earnings per common share take into account the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock are exercised and converted into common stock. Proceeds assumed to have been received on such exercise or conversion, are assumed to be used to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at the average market price during the period, as required by the  treasury stock method  of accounting for common stock equivalents. For purposes of calculating the basic and diluted earnings per share, the Company s reported net income is adjusted for dividends on preferred stock to determine the net income to common shareholders.  Securities that could potentially dilute basic earnings per common share in future periods that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per common share because to do so would have been anti-dilutive amounted to 437,560 shares as of September 30, 2016 and 257,667 shares as of September 30, 2015.  
   
 The calculations of basic and diluted earnings per common share are presented below for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

The amount of preferred stock dividends related to each series of preferred stock are presented below for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:   

Note 4 Securities  
 Management determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date. Securities classified as available for sale are those securities that the Company intends to hold for an indefinite period of time, but not necessarily to maturity. Available for sale securities are carried at fair value.  
 Securities classified as held to maturity are those debt securities the Company has both the intent and ability to hold to maturity regardless of changes in market conditions, liquidity needs or changes in general economic conditions. These securities are carried at cost adjusted for the amortization of premium and accretion of discount, computed by a method which approximates the interest method over the terms of the securities.  
 The Company previously transferred investment securities from available for sale to held to maturity securities.  Due to these transfers, securities classified as held to maturity have net unrealized holding gains, before taxes, totaling $21 thousand as of September 30, 2016 and $43 thousand as of December 31, 2015, which are being amortized over the remaining life of the related securities as an adjustment of yield in a manner consistent with the accretion of discount on the same transferred debt securities. This will have no impact on the Company s net income because the amortization of the unrealized holding loss reported in equity will offset the effect on the interest income of the accretion of the discount on these securities.  
 The amortized cost, unrealized gains and losses, and the fair value of the Company s investment securities available for sale and held to maturity are as follows for the periods presented:  

13 

Included in unrealized losses are market losses on securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for twelve months or more and those securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months. The table below details the aggregate unrealized losses and aggregate fair value of the underlying securities whose fair values are below their amortized cost at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

14 

As of September 30, 2016, management believes that the estimated fair value of the securiti  es disclosed above is primarily dependent upon the movement in market interest rates, particularly given the minimal inherent credit risk associated with the issuers of these securities and that the unrealized losses in these portfolios are not the result   of deteriorating credit within any investment category.   
 Securities issued by states and political subdivisions are all rated investment grade. Each holding is reviewed quarterly for impairment by management and our third party investment advisor. All mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are issued by U.S. government sponsored agencies; there are no holdings of private label mortgage backed securities or securities backed by loans classified as  Alt-A  or  Subprime .  
 Although the fair value will fluctuate as market interest rates move, management believes that these fair values will recover as the underlying portfolios mature. The Company evaluates a variety of factors in concluding whether securities are other-than-temporarily impaired. These factors include, but are not limited to, the type and purpose of the bond, the underlying rating of the bond issuer, and the presence of credit enhancements (i.e. state guarantees, municipal bond insurance, collateral requirements, etc.). The Company does not intend to sell any of these securities and it is unlikely that it will be required to sell any of these securities before recovery. Management does not believe any individual unrealized loss on individual securities, as of September 30, 2016, represents other than temporary impairment. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 there were realized gains of $456 thousand and $795 thousand.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 there were realized gains of $125 thousand.  
 Securities with an estimated fair value of $41.9 million and $55.2 million were pledged at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, to secure public fund deposits. In addition, securities pledged to secure borrowings by the Bank totaled $40 thousand and $60 thousand as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
 The amortized cost and fair value of securities as of September 30, 2016 by contractual maturity are shown below. Certain of these investment securities have call features which allow the issuer to call the security prior to its maturity date at the issuer s discretion.

Note 5 Loans Receivable and Related Allowance for Loan Losses   
 Loans receivable consist of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

In August, 2016, the Company increased its loans outstanding through the acquisition of  $64.4 million of various types of performing commercial loans within the Bank s market area, and  in June,  2016, the Company purchased $12.7 million of performing residential real estate loans; all of which were underwritten using similar standards as the Bank uses for its organic portfolio. 
   
 The following tables summarize the activity in the allowance for loan losses by loan class for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

16 

The following tables present the balance in the allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 disaggregated on the basis of the Company s impairment method by class of loans receivable along with the balance of loans receivable by class disaggregated on the basis of the Company s impairment methodology:  

17 

The following tables summarize information in regard to impaired loans by loan portfolio class as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 as well as for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively:   

18 

The following table presents non-accrual loans by classes of the loan portfolio as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

The Company s policy for interest income recognition on nonaccrual loans is to recognize income under the cash basis when the loans are both current and the collateral on the loan is sufficient to cover the outstanding obligation to the Company. The Company will not recognize income if these factors do not exist. Interest that would have been accrued on non-accruing loans under the original terms but was not recognized as interest income totaled $22 thousand and $72 thousand for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $54 thousand and $179 thousand for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  
   
 19 

The following tables present the classes of the loan portfolio summarized by the aggregate pass rating and the classified ratings of special mention, substandard and doubtful within the Company s internal risk rating system as of September 30, 2016 and Dec  ember 31, 2015:   

The performance and credit quality of the loan portfolio is also monitored by analyzing the age of the loans receivable as determined by the length of time a recorded payment is past due. The following tables present the classes of the loan portfolio summarized by the past due status as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

20 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no loans 90 days past due and still accruing interest. 
 Troubled Debt Restructurings 
 The Company may grant a concession or modification for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower s declining financial condition that it would not otherwise consider, resulting in a modified loan which is then identified as a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR ). The Company may modify loans through rate reductions, extensions of maturity, interest only payments, or payment modifications to better match the timing of cash flows due under the modified terms with the cash flows from the borrowers  operations. Loan modifications are intended to minimize the economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral. TDRs are considered impaired loans for purposes of calculating the Company s allowance for loan losses.  
 The Company identifies loans for potential restructure primarily through direct communication with the borrower and evaluation of the borrower s financial statements, revenue projections, tax returns, and credit reports. Even if the borrower is not presently in default, management will consider the likelihood that cash flow shortages, adverse economic conditions, and negative trends may result in a payment default in the near future.  
 The following tables summarize the balance of outstanding TDR s at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

During the third quarter of 2016, one performing commercial mortgage TDR loan totaling $1.3 million was refinanced by the Bank under current market terms and is no longer considered a TDR loan. 
   
 21 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose terms have been modified in TDR s.  As of September 30, 2016, one commercial loan totaling $200 thousand was in default and   is classified as non-accrual.  As of December 31, 2015, two commercial loans, classified as TDR s, with a combined balance totaling $64 thousand were in default and were classified as non-accrual status.  Additionally, a mortgage loan restructured during t  he fourth quarter of 2015 with an outstanding balance of $638 thousand was past due 30 days as of December 31, 2015.   
 The following table reflects information regarding TDR s entered into by the Company for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

The TDRs entered into during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 consisted of a commercial loan whereby the customer s payment schedule was modified and a commercial mortgage and residential mortgage, both of which included an interest rate reduction.  None of these restructurings included any forgiveness of debt.   
 The carrying amount of foreclosed residential real estate properties held was $764 thousand as of September 30, 2016.  There were no consumer mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate property that are in the process of foreclosure as of September 30, 2016. 

Note 6 Deposits  
 The components of deposits at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows: 

22 

Included in time, other at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are brokered deposits of $125.8 million and $113.3 million, respectively.   
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 aggregate time deposits which exceed the $250 thousand FDIC insurance limit were $8.6 million and $10.0 million, respectively. 
 At September 30, 2016, the scheduled maturities of time deposits were as follows:  

Note 7 Shareholders  Equity  
 As of December 31, 2015, the Company had 10,000,000 authorized common shares.  The Company amended its articles of incorporation, effective May 4, 2016, to increase the number of authorized shares of its common stock, $1.00 par value, from 10,000,000 shares to 20,000,000 shares.  The amendment was approved by shareholders at the 2016 annual meeting of shareholders held on May 3, 2016. 
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the Company had 3,404 shares and 9,404 shares, respectively, of 9%, fixed rate, Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock outstanding totaling $3.4 million and $9.4 million, respectively. 
 On January 22, 2016, First Priority redeemed $6.0 million of its outstanding Preferred Stock for a total redemption price of $1,016.75 per share which included accrued dividends. This redemption included all shares of outstanding Series A (4,579 shares; par value $1,000) and Series B (229 shares; par value $1,000); and approximately 25.9% of Series C (1,192 shares of 4,596 shares outstanding; par value $1,000).  The shares of Series C were selected for redemption on a pro rata basis.  After the completion of these redemptions, 3,404 shares of Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding as of September 30, 2016. 
 The Preferred Stock has no maturity date and ranks senior to common stock with respect to dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding up. The Company may redeem the Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at its liquidation preference plus accrued and unpaid dividends.  

Note 8 Stock Compensation Program  
 In 2005, the Company adopted the 2005 Stock Compensation Program, which was amended at the Company s annual meeting on April 23, 2009 as the 2009 Stock Compensation Program (the  Program ) and further amended effective March 18, 2010. The Program allows equity benefits to be awarded in the form of Incentive Stock Options, Compensatory Stock Options or Restricted Stock. The Program authorizes the Board of Directors to grant options up to an aggregate maximum of 1,207,957 shares to officers, other employees and directors of the Company, including 382,957 shares which were authorized for grant under this plan as a result of the merger with Affinity. Only employees of the Company will be eligible to receive Incentive Stock Options, and such grants are subject to the limitations under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code.  
 All stock options granted under the Program fully vest in four years from the date of grant (or potentially earlier upon a change of control), excluding options issued in regards to the Company s Severance Plan which vest only upon change in control, and options terminate ten years from the date of the grant. The exercise price of the options granted is the fair value of a share of common stock at the time of the grant.  
   
 23 

A summary of the Stock Option Plan is presented below:   

(1)   
 
 Included in options outstanding and exercisable at September 30, 2016 are 100,000 organizer options, with an exercise price of $10.00 per share, exchanged as part of the 2008 acquisition of Prestige Community Bank which were issued outside of the Program.     

 The weighted average remaining contractual lives of all outstanding stock options and exercisable options based on the closing stock price at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were 6.17 years and 3.23 years, respectively, and 6.67 years and 3.66 years, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of all outstanding stock options was $357 thousand as of September 30, 2016, including $69 thousand related to currently exercisable options, and $618 thousand as of December 31, 2015, including $121 thousand related to exercisable options.  
 The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: 

For option grants to individual employees, the Company assumes no forfeitures.  For option grants made to a group of employees, a 10% forfeiture rate is typically assumed at the date of the grant, and compared to actual forfeitures on an annual basis. 
 Under the terms of the merger agreement dated February 28, 2013, with Affinity, each Affinity option became fully vested and was exchanged for a grant of 0.9813 FPFC options, with an adjusted exercise price to reflect the exchange ratio and maintains the same expiration date as the original option. As of September 30, 2016, 45,460 of these options remain outstanding with an average exercise price of $9.42 and a remaining contractual term of 3.04 years. 
 The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company s history and expectation of dividend payouts.  Due to the Company s lack of sufficient historical exercise data and the limited period of time for which shares have been issued, the  simplified  method is used to determine the expected life of options, calculated as the average of the sum of the vesting term and original contractual term for all periods presented. The expected volatility percentage is based on the average expected volatility of similar public financial institutions in the Company s market area.  The risk-free interest rates for periods within the contractual life of the awards are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. 
   
 24 

As of September 30, 2016, there was $258 thousand of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options granted after January 1, 2007, excluding those stock options issued in conjunction with the Company s severanc  e plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.85 years. There was no tax benefit recognized related to this stock-based compensation. There are 355,000 stock options issued in connection with the termination of the prev  iously executed change in control agreements and the adoption of the severance plan, with $576 thousand of unrecognized compensation cost which will only be recognized if a change in control occurs, based on the options which remain outstanding and are pro  bable to vest at that time.  During 2015, there were 99,000 performance options issued to various employees.  Certain performance criteria must be achieved over the   performance period in order for the option granted to vest.    Performance is analyzed on a q  uarterly basis to determine if the specific required performance is more likely than not to be achieved.  Based on this evaluation, 27,500 performance options were cancelled in 2015 leaving 71,500 outstanding as of September 30, 2016.  These non-vested opt  ions may be further adjusted in the future.  
 Restricted Stock grants fully vest after a minimum of three years from the date of grant (or potentially earlier upon a change of control or retirement after the age of 66), subject to the recipient remaining an employee of the Company.  Directors are also granted restricted stock as part of their compensation for their services on the Board of Directors, or related Committees, as approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board.  Upon issuance of the shares, resale of the shares is restricted during the vesting period, during which the shares may not be sold, pledged, or otherwise disposed of. Prior to the vesting date and in the event the recipient terminates association with Company for any reasons other than death, disability or change of control, the recipient forfeits all rights to the shares that would otherwise be issued under the grant. Compensation expense related to restricted stock awards granted under the Plan is determined at the date of the award based on the estimated fair value of the shares and is amortized over the vesting period.  As of September 30, 2016, there was $389 thousand of unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock, which will be amortized through July 28, 2020.  
 A summary of restricted stock award activity is presented below for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:  

Note 9 Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk  
 The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit. Such commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet.  
 The Company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.  
 At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, outstanding commitments to extend credit consisting of total unfunded commitments under lines of credit were $89.0 million and $97.8 million, respectively. In addition, as of each of these dates, the Company maintained $681 thousand and $711 thousand of performance standby letters of credit outstanding, respectively, and $1.4 million and $1.1 million of financial standby letters of credit outstanding, respectively, on behalf of its customers.  
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company also has deposit letters of credit totaling $12.2 million, issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh ( FHLB ), as required to provide collateral on certain municipal deposits maintained at First Priority.  These deposit letters of credit are secured by a blanket lien on selected mortgage loans within First Priority Bank s portfolio.  
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.  
   
 25 

Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The Bank evaluates   each customer s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but may include residential or commer  cial real estate, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment.  

Note 10 Regulatory Matters  
 The Dodd-Frank Act required the FRB to establish minimum consolidated capital requirements for bank holding companies that are as stringent as those required for insured depositary subsidiaries. The federal banking agencies approved rules that implemented the Dodd-Frank requirements and certain other regulatory capital reforms which were designed to enhance such requirements and implement the revised standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, commonly referred to as Basel III.  These rules (i) introduced a new capital ratio pursuant to the prompt corrective action provisions, the common equity tier 1 capital to risk rated assets ratio, (ii) increased the adequately capitalized and well capitalized thresholds for the Tier 1 risk based capital ratios to 6% and 8% respectively, (iii) changed the treatment of certain capital components for determining Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital, and (iv) changed the risk weighting of certain assets and off balance sheet items in determining risk weighted assets. The new risk based capital rules became effective January 1, 2015. 
 Under the revised capital guidelines, the Bank s minimum capital to risk-adjusted assets requirements consist of a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% (6.5% to be considered  well capitalized ) and a tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, increased from 4.0% (and increased from 6.0% to 8.0% to be considered  well capitalized  the total capital ratio remains at 8.0% under the new rules (10.0% to be considered  well capitalized ).  In addition, the Bank must maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4.0% (5.0% to be considered  well capitalized ).  The new minimum capital requirements became effective on January 1, 2015. 
 Under the new rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions (including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers), a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer comprised of common equity tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements in an amount greater than 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets. The capital contribution buffer requirements began to phase in over a three-year period beginning January 1, 2016 and is 0.625% during 2016.  The capital buffer requirement, on a fully phased-in basis as of January 1, 2019, effectively raises the minimum required common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to 7.0% (5.125% in 2016), the Tier 1 capital ratio to 8.5% (6.625% in 2016), and the total capital ratio to 10.5% (8.625% in 2016). 
 The Bank s capital amounts (dollars in thousands) and ratios at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are presented below:

First Priority s ability to pay cash dividends is dependent on receiving cash in the form of dividends from the Bank. However, certain restrictions exist regard  ing the ability of the Bank to transfer funds to First Priority in the form of cash dividends. All dividends are currently subject to prior approval of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the FDIC and are payable only from the undivid  ed profits of the Bank, with the exception of an exemption enacted by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities which allows the Bank to pay dividends related to the preferred stock originally issued under the U.S. Department of the Treasury s   Troubled Asset Relief Program Capital Purchase Program. Additionally, First Priority has met the requirement of obtaining prior approval from the Federal Reserve Bank on any payment of dividends, including dividends on the aforementioned preferred stock, w  hen net income for the past four quarters   is not sufficient   to fund the dividend payments over that same period or when such payment would negatively impact capital adequacy of the Company.   
 Note 11 Fair Value Measurements and Fair Values of Financial Instruments  
 Management uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value of the Bank s financial instruments; however, there are inherent weaknesses in any estimation technique. Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the fair value estimates herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could have realized in a sales transaction on the dates indicated. The estimated fair value amounts have been measured as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and have not been re-evaluated or updated for purposes of these financial statements subsequent to those respective dates. As such, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different than the amounts reported at each period-end.  
 The Company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820  Fair Value Measurements , the fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is best determined based upon quoted market prices. However, in some instances, there are no quoted market prices for the Company s various financial instruments. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Accordingly, the fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument.  
 The fair value guidance provides a consistent definition of fair value, which focuses on exit price in an orderly transaction (that is, not a forced liquidation or distressed sale) between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. If there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability, a change in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate. In such instances, determining the price at which willing market participants would transact at the measurement date under current market conditions depends on the facts and circumstances and requires the use of significant judgment. The fair value is a reasonable point within the range that is most representative of fair value under current market conditions.  
 FASB ASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation methods used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under FASB ASC Topic 820 are as follows:  
 Level 1 : Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.   
 Level 2 : Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.   
 Level 3 : Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported with little or no market activity). Management utilizes inputs that it believes a market participant would use.  
 An asset s or liability s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  
   
 27 

For financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis, the fair value measurements by level wi  thin the fair value hierarchy used at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows:  

For financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, the fair value measurements by level within the fair value hierarchy used at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows: 

28 

Management generally uses a discounted appraisal technique in valuing impaired assets, resulting in the discounting of the collateral values underlying each impaired asset. A   discounted tax assessment rate has been applied for smaller assets to determine the discounted collateral value. All impaired loans are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Collateral may be real estate and/or business assets. Impaired loans   are reviewed and evaluated on at least a quarterly basis for additional impairment.   
 Quantitative information about Level 3 fair value measurements at September 30, 2016 is included in the table below:  

Quantitative information about Level 3 fair value measurements at December 31, 2015 is included in the table below: 

(1)    
 
 Fair Value is generally determined through independent appraisals of the underlying collateral, which include Level 3 inputs that are not identifiable.    

(2)    
 
 Appraisals may be adjusted by management for qualitative factors such as economic conditions and estimated liquidation expenses.    

(3)    
 
 The range and weighted average of qualitative factors such as economic conditions and estimated liquidation expenses are presented as a percent of the appraised value.    

 Valuation of real estate collateral may be discounted based on the age of the existing appraisal.  Discounts are typically not taken for recent appraisals. Valuations related to business assets used as collateral are typically discounted more heavily due to the inherent level of uncertainty in determining the fair value of these types of assets. Liquidation costs relating to these assets are charged to expense.  
   
 29 

Other real estate owned measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis consists of properties acquired as a result of accepting a deed in lieu of foreclos  ure, foreclosure or through other means related to collateral on Bank loans which resulted in a gain or loss recognized during the period. Costs relating to the development or improvement of assets are capitalized and costs relating to holding the property   are charged to expense. As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of other real estate owned consists of balances of $1.2 million, net of a valuation allowance of $527 thousand.  As of December 31, 2015, the fair value of other real estate owned consists o  f balances of $1.3 million, net of a valuation allowance of $404 thousand.  Fair value is generally determined based upon independent third-party appraisals of the property.  
 Real estate properties acquired through, or in lieu of, foreclosure are to be sold and are carried at fair value less estimated cost to sell. Fair value is based upon independent market prices or appraised value of the property. These assets are included in Level 3 fair value based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  
 The following information should not be interpreted as an estimate of the fair value of the entire Company since a fair value calculation is only provided for a limited portion of the Company s assets and liabilities. Due to a wide range of valuation techniques and the degree of subjectivity used in making the estimates, comparisons between the Company s disclosures and those of other companies may not be meaningful.  
 The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of the Company s financial instruments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  
 Cash and Cash Equivalents  
 The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and short-term instruments approximate those assets  fair values.  
 Securities  
 The fair value of securities available for sale (carried at fair value) and held to maturity (carried at amortized cost) are determined by obtaining quoted market prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level 1), or matrix pricing (Level 2), which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted market prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities  relationship to other benchmark quoted prices.  
 Loans Receivable  
 The fair values of loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using market rates at the balance sheet date that reflect the credit and interest rate-risk inherent in the loans. Projected future cash flows are calculated based upon contractual maturity or call dates, projected repayments and prepayments of principal.  
 Impaired Loans  
 Impaired loans, which are included in loans receivable, are those that are accounted for under FASB ASC Topic 310,  Receivables  ,  in which the Company has measured impairment generally based on the fair value of the loan s collateral. Fair value is generally determined based upon independent third party appraisals of the properties, or discounted cash flows based upon the expected proceeds. These assets are included as Level 3 fair values, based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. The fair value of the impaired loans consists of the loan balances, net of any valuation allowance. As of September 30, 2016 the fair value of impaired loans consisted of loan balances with an allowance recorded of $2.1 million, net of valuation allowances of $362 thousand; and loan balances with no related allowance recorded of $1.7 million, net of partial charge-offs of $927 thousand. As of December 31, 2015 the fair value of impaired loans consisted of loan balances with an allowance recorded of $2.5 million, net of valuation allowances of $452 thousand and partial charge-offs of $2 thousand; and loan balances with no related allowance recorded of $2.5 million, net of partial charge-offs of $867 thousand.  
 Restricted Investment in Bank Stock  
 The carrying amount of restricted investment in bank stock approximates fair value, and considers the limited marketability of such securities.  
 Accrued Interest Receivable and Payable  
 The carrying amount of accrued interest receivable and accrued interest payable approximates fair value.  
   
 30 

Deposit Liabilities   
 The fair values disclosed for demand deposits (interest and noninterest checking), money market and savings accounts are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amounts). Fair values for fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered in the market to the maturities of the time deposits.  
 Short-Term Borrowings  
 The carrying amounts of short-term borrowings approximate their fair values.  
 Long-Term Debt  
 Fair values of FHLB advances are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, based on quoted prices for new FHLB advances with similar credit risk characteristics, terms and remaining maturity. These prices obtained from this active market represent a market value that is deemed to represent the transfer price if the liability were assumed by a third party.  
 Subordinated Debt 
 The fair values of subordinated debt has been estimated using discounted cash flow calculation taking into account contractual maturities, call features, and market interest rates for instruments with similar financial and credit characteristics.  These instruments are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments  
 Fair values for the Company s off-balance sheet financial instruments (lending commitments and letters of credit) are based on fees currently charged in the market to enter into similar agreements, taking into account, the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties  credit standing.  
   
 At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments were as follows:

I  tem 2.      Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   
 The following discussion summarizes First Priority s results of operations and highlights material changes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and its financial condition as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. This discussion is intended to provide additional information about the significant changes in the results of operations presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for First Priority and its wholly owned subsidiary, First Priority Bank. First Priority s consolidated financial condition and results of operations consist essentially of the Bank s financial condition and results of operations. Current performance does not guarantee, and may not be indicative of, similar performance in the future.   
 You should read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2016 included herein as well as with the audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying footnotes for the year ended December 31, 2015, included in the Company s Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  
 This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as First Priority s plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Therefore, this analysis should be read in conjunction with the   Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements   presented elsewhere in this document and the  Risk Factors  described in the Company s Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2015.  
 Overview  
 The following table sets forth selected measures of First Priority s financial position or performance for the dates or periods indicated.  

(1)   
 
 Total revenue equals net interest income plus non-interest income.    

 Like most financial institutions, First Priority derives the majority of its income from interest it receives on its interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments. First Priority s primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is its deposits, on which it pays interest. Consequently, one of the key measures of First Priority s success is its amount of net interest income, or the difference between the income on its average interest-earning assets and the expense on its average interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Another key measure is the spread between the yield First Priority earns on these average interest-earning assets and the rate it pays on its average interest-bearing liabilities, which is called its net interest spread.  
 There are risks inherent in all loans, and First Priority maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible. This allowance is maintained by charging a provision for loan losses against operating earnings. A detailed discussion of this process, as well as several tables describing the allowance for loan losses is included herein.  
 In addition to earning interest on its loans and investments, First Priority earns income through other sources, such as fees and other charges to its banking customers and income from providing wealth management services, as well as net gains or losses realized from the sale of assets. The various components of non-interest income, as well as non-interest expense, are described in this section.  
 Critical Accountin g  Policies, Judgments and Estimates 
 First Priority has adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that are consistent with general practices within the banking industry in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. First Priority s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s Form 10-K as of December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
   
 33 

Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by First Priority that have a material impact on the car  rying value of certain assets and liabilities. First Priority considers these accounting policies to be critical accounting estimates. The judgment and assumptions used are based on historical experience and other factors, which First Priority believes to   be reasonable under the circumstances and have been reasonably consistent with prior results. Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made, actual results could differ from these estimates, which could have a material impact on the carrying   values of its assets and liabilities and its results of operations. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to investment securities impairment evaluation, the valuation of acquired loans, the dete  rmination of the allowance for loan losses, valuation of other real estate owned, the analysis of potential impairment of goodwill, the valuation of deferred tax assets and accounting for stock-based compensation.   
 Investment Securities Impairment Evaluation.  In estimating other-than-temporary impairment losses, management considers (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and (3) the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. When a determination is made that an other-than-temporary impairment exists but the Company does not intend to sell the debt security and it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell the debt security prior to its anticipated recovery, the other-than-temporary impairment is separated into (a) the amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to a decrease in cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security (the credit loss) and (b) the amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to all other factors. The amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings. The amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income. Management believes that there are no investment securities with other-than-temporary impairment for each of the reporting periods presented.   
 Acquired Loans.  Fair values for acquired loans are based on a discounted cash flow methodology that involves significant assumptions and judgments as to estimates of credit risk, prepayment risk, liquidity risk, default rates, loss severity, payment speeds, collateral values and discount rate.   
 Allowance for Loan Losses.  The allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction to loans.   
 Pools of loans are evaluated for loss exposure based upon historical loss rates in each category of loans and adjusted for qualitative factors. Management assigned each factor a value to reflect improving, stable or declining conditions based on its best judgment using relevant information available at the time of the evaluation. Adjustments to the factors are supported through documentation of changes in conditions in a narrative accompanying the allowance for loan loss calculation.  
 An unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management s estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio.  
 Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  
 See the  Allowance for Loan Losses  section related to Balance Sheet Review as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 for more information.  
 Other Real Estate Owned.  Assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less cost to sell at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Any write-down, at or prior to the dates the real estate is considered foreclosed, is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.   
 Goodwill.  Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment.   
 Income Taxes.  Deferred taxes are provided on the liability method whereby deferred tax assets ( DTA ) are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return with the Bank.   
   
 34 

If management makes a determination based on the available evidence that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred t  ax assets will not be realized in future periods a valuation allowance is calculated and recorded. These determinations are inherently subjective and dependent upon estimates and judgments concerning management s evaluation of both positive and negative ev  idence. The weight given to the potential effect of positive and negative evidence must be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified.   
 When determining the need for a valuation allowance, the Company assessed the possible sources of taxable income available under tax law to realize a tax benefit for deductible temporary differences and carryforwards, as defined by Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 740-10-30-18. This guidance related to when a valuation allowance on the DTA should be maintained, generally provides that the valuation allowance should be reversed, when in the judgment of management, it is more likely than not that the DTA will be realized.  Management has determined that the DTA will be realized and does not maintain a valuation allowance. 
 Stock Based Compensation.  Compensation costs related to share-based payment transactions are recognized in the financial statements over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on management s assumptions.  The value of restricted stock awards is determined based on the estimated fair value of the shares at the date of the award.   
 Results of Operations  
 Income Statement Review  
 First Priority s results of operations are affected by five major elements: (1) net interest income, or the difference between interest income earned on loans and investments and interest expense accrued on deposits and borrowed funds; (2) the provision for loan losses, or the amount added to the allowance for loan losses to provide reserves for inherent losses on loans; (3) non-interest income, consisting of income from wealth management services, fees and other charges to our banking customers, and net gains or losses realized from the sale of assets; (4) non-interest expense, which consists primarily of salaries, employee benefits and other operating  expenses; and (5) income taxes, including deferred taxes, when applicable. Each of these major elements is reviewed in more detail in the following discussion.   
 Results of Operations Comparative Summary    
 Shown in the table below are the three month reported results of operations as well as the increase (decrease) for the respective periods.  

35 

Operating results reflected above for the three   and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were impacted by the following items, including the specific line items impacted:  

On August 21, 2016, the Bank significantly increased its loans outstanding through the acquisition of 23 commercial lending relationships totaling $64 million in outstanding loan balances from another local banking institution.  The loan purchase had a modestly negative impact on third quarter, 2016, operating results as the Bank also recorded an initial loan loss provision of approximately $500 thousand related to these acquired loans, consistent with its current practice that an allowance be established on all loans generated, and recorded one-time transaction costs of approximately $50 thousand related to the purchase.   Also, during the second quarter of 2016, the Bank purchased $12.7 million of performing residential real estate loans which were underwritten using similar standards as the Bank uses for its organic portfolio.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, total loans outstanding increased 19.1%.       

In addition, the Bank took advantage of financial market conditions during the current quarter and the first nine months of 2016 in selling $6.5 million and $12.8 million, respectively, of its longer duration state and municipal obligations and recorded gains from these investment sales of $456 thousand and $795 thousand in each of these respective periods, which are included in non-interest income above.  Comparatively, securities gains recorded in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, totaled $125 thousand, which resulted from the sale of $7.5 million of U.S. Treasury securities.     

Also, the Company s earnings per share has and will continue to be positively impacted from the refinancing of $6.0 million of the 9% preferred stock in January, 2016, which resulted from the issuance of 7% subordinated debentures in November 2015.  These combined steps have provided an on-going benefit to our income available to common shareholders of $0.01 per quarter as the current after tax cost of the interest expense on the debentures of 4.62% is a significant reduction to the prior 9% after tax impact of the preferred stock dividends.     

 Net Interest Income  
 First Priority s primary source of revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is determined by the average balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned and paid on these balances. The amount of net interest income recorded by First Priority is affected by the rate, mix and amount of growth of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the amount of interest-earning assets as compared to the amount of interest-bearing liabilities, and by changes in interest rates earned and interest rates paid on these assets and liabilities.  
 The following tables set forth, for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, information related to First Priority s average balances, yields on average assets, and costs of average liabilities. Average balances are derived from the daily balances throughout the periods indicated and yields are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of the corresponding assets or liabilities. Average loans are stated net of deferred costs. The net dollar amounts and percentage changes of interest income and expense are presented for comparative purposes.

Analysis of Changes in Net Interest Income  

(1)   
 
 Interest income includes dividends from restricted investments in bank stocks, average balance of these restricted stocks are included in non-interest-earning assets.

(1)   
 
  Interest income includes dividends from restricted investments in bank stocks, average balance of these restricted stocks are included in non-interest-earning assets.    

38 

Net interest income can also be analyzed in terms of the impact of changing interest rates and changing volume as shown in the Changes in Net Interest Income table below which sets forth the effect which varying levels of average interest-earning assets, i  nterest-bearing liabilities and the applicable yields and rates have had on changes in net interest income for the periods presented.   

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, net interest income totaled $4.20 million, a decrease of $11 thousand, or 0.3%, from $4.21 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Net interest margin declined 18 basis points from 3.53% for the third quarter of 2015 to 3.35% for the same period in 2016.  Net interest spread, defined as the mathematical difference between the yield on average earning assets and the rate paid on average interest-bearing liabilities, decreased 23 basis points from 3.39% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 3.16% for the same period in 2016. When comparing these periods, incremental growth of balances accounted for a net increase of $178 thousand while the change in our relative rate structure resulted in a net decline in net interest income of $189 thousand. 
 Average interest earning assets for the third quarter of 2016 increased $30.8 million, or 6.5%, including an increase in average loans of $55.4 million, or 14.1%, offset by a decrease in average investment balances of $28.5 million, or 36.9%, when compared to the prior year quarter. This overall increased volume of average earning assets provided an additional $359 thousand in interest income, with $558 thousand provided from incremental loan balances. The average yield on earning assets increased 7 basis points in the current quarter compared to the prior year three month period from 4.19% to 4.26% which resulted in a rate related decrease of interest income of $25 thousand between the periods.  This change in interest income related to rates is not only impacted by changes in comparable rates, but also by balance increases or decreases and the resulting product mix structure.  When comparing these periods, this includes a decrease of $70 thousand attributable to lower yields on loans and $23 thousand related to deposits with banks and other interest income, including $12 thousand related to a decline of dividends received on the Bank s restricted investment in FHLB stock, partially offset by an increase of $68 thousand attributable to higher average yields on investment securities. 
 Average interest bearing liabilities increased $24.3 million, or 6.2%, when comparing the current quarter to the prior year quarter. Average deposit balances increased $36.3 million, or 11.1%, consisting of an increase in interest bearing NOW accounts of $17.4 million, or 54.5%, an increase in money market and savings deposits of $11.7 million, or 12.6%, and an increase in time deposits of $7.2 million, or 3.5%.  Also, when comparing these periods, the issuance of subordinated debt in November 2015 resulted in an average balance of $9.2 million in the third quarter of 2016.  The incremental growth of interest bearing liabilities resulted in an overall increase in interest expense of $181 thousand, of which $172 thousand was specifically attributable to the subordinated debt. At the same time, due to the change in mix of balances, the average rate on interest bearing liabilities in the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter increased from 0.80% to 1.10%, resulting in an overall increase in interest expense of $164 thousand between the periods related to this increase in rates.  
   
 39 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net interest income increased $127 thousand, or 1.1%, to $12.21 million compared to $12.08 million for the same period in 2015.   Net interest margin decreased 20 basis points from 3.54% for the first nine months of 2015 to 3.34% for the same period in 2016. Net interest spread decreased 24 basis points from 3.39% for the first nine months of 2015 to 3.15% for the same period in 2016  . When comparing these periods, incremental growth of balances accounted for an increase of $630 thousand while the change in our relative rate structure resulted in a decline in net interest income of $503 thousand.   
 Average interest earning assets for the first nine months of 2016 increased $31.5 million, or 6.9%, including an increase in average loans of $41.6 million, or 10.9%, offset by a decrease in average investment balances of $12.5 million, or 17.6%, when compared to the prior year. This increased volume of average earning assets provided an additional $1.29 million in interest income, of which $1.41 million was provided from incremental loan balances.  The average yield on earning assets increased 3 basis points in the current year compared to the prior year nine month period from 4.22% to 4.25%.  The change in interest income related to changing rates, which is not only impacted by changes in comparable interest rates, but also by changes in product mix structure, resulted in a decrease of net interest income of $176 thousand when comparing these periods. 
 Average interest bearing liabilities increased $26.8 million, or 7.1%, in 2016. During this time, overall deposit balances increased $32.7 million, or 10.0%, as interest bearing demand deposits increased $14.3 million, money market and savings deposits increased $0.2 million and time deposits increased $18.2 million,. At the same time, borrowed funds declined $5.8 million, as the current year increase of $9.2 million related to subordinated debt was offset by a decline in FHLB advances of $15.0 million.  The incremental growth of interest bearing liabilities resulted in an increase of interest expense of $655 thousand. At the same time, the average rate on interest bearing liabilities increased 27 basis point from 0.83% for the first nine months of 2015 to 1.10% in the current year, which along with the change in mix of balances, accounted for an increase in interest expense of $327 thousand due to the change in our relative rate structure. 
 Provision for Loan Losses  
 The allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses charged against operations. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance as recoveries.  
 The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated. Management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on known or potential risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, the composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revisions as more information becomes available or economic conditions change.  
 At the end of each quarter or more often, if necessary, First Priority analyzes the collectability of its loans and accordingly adjusts the loan loss allowance to an appropriate level. The allowance for loan losses covers estimated credit losses on individually evaluated loans that are determined to be impaired, as well as estimated credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio. For a description of the process for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, see the  Allowance for Loan Losses  section below.  
 The provision for loan losses was $510 thousand and $710 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $195 thousand and $445 thousand for the same periods in 2015.  The ongoing level of provision is impacted by the adequacy of the allowance as described above, including an analysis of impaired and non-performing loans, as well as by the level of incremental loan volume and net charge-offs of loans. The provision recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 included approximately $500 thousand related to the $64 million commercial loan purchase completed in August 2016.  Total loans, excluding the impact of the commercial loans purchased, increased $14.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Net loan charge-offs or recoveries resulted in a net recovery of $6 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016 while net charge-offs were $182 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and totaled $118 thousand and $115 thousand, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The allowance for loan losses was $3.3 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $2.8 million at December 31, 2015 which represented 0.68%, for both of these periods, of total loans outstanding.  
 Acquired loans are initially recorded at acquisition date at their acquisition date fair values, and therefore, are excluded from the calculation of loan loss reserves as of the acquisition date. As acquired loans are paid off, refinanced or extended under First Priority s credit underwriting process, they are no longer considered acquired loans, but instead are prospectively considered originated loans and therefore, are included as part of the calculation of the allowance for loan losses. Beginning in the third quarter of 2016, due to the immaterial remaining balances of purchased non-credit impaired loans, all loans are included in quarterly adequacy of the allowance as described above, excluding three remaining purchased credit impaired loans, which are analyzed separately.  These loans consist of two commercial loans and one commercial real estate loan with a combined net recorded investment of $225 thousand, net of combined non-amortizing specific reserves totaling $362 thousand.

Non-Interest Income  
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, non-interest income totaled $641 thousand and $1.38 million, compared to $342 thousand and $834 thousand, for the same periods in 2015, respectively. As detailed in the table below, non-interest income is comprised of wealth management fees, which are principally non-recurring commissions and fees related to the sale of insurance products and annuities, service charges on deposit accounts, income resulting from the investment in bank owned life insurance, gains from the sale of investment securities, and other fees which the Bank collects from its banking customers.   
 The Company sold $6.5 million and $12.8 million of long duration state and municipal investment securities in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, which were classified as available for sale, to take advantage of favorable market conditions, and resulted in gains from these sales totaling $456 thousand and $795 thousand for these respective periods as reflected in the table below.  During both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company sold $7.5 million of U.S. Treasury securities which resulted in gains from those sales of $125 thousand. 
 Components of non-interest income are shown in the table below:  

Non-Interest Expenses  
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, non-interest expenses were $3.64 million and $10.60 million, respectively, compared to $3.53 million and $10.31 million for the same periods in 2015, or increases of $107 thousand and $291 thousand, respectively.  The following table sets forth information related to the various components of non-interest expenses for each respective period.  

41 

Highlights of significant non-interest expenses items for the third quarter 2016 compared to the third quarter 2015   

Salaries and employee benefits increased $125 thousand, or 6.5%, in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. This increase resulted from incremental staffing costs to enhance business development opportunities and higher employee healthcare costs, partially offset by lower stock based compensation expenses.     

Occupancy and equipment costs decreased $30 thousand, or 6.2%, comparing the current quarter and the same period last year, primarily related to the closing of the Plumstead office during the second quarter of 2016.         

Marketing, advertising and business development expenses decreased $56 thousand, or 44.4%, for the period ended September 30, 2016.  The third quarter of 2015 included business development and marketing campaigns designed to take advantage of bank acquisitions announced during that time within the Bank s markets.     

FDIC insurance assessments and Pennsylvania bank shares tax expenses are primarily calculated based on asset size and equity levels of the Bank.  The decline in the bank shares tax is primarily related to a prior year overpayment.      

Net costs related to other real estate owned increased $65 thousand, or 71.4%, in the current quarter compared to the same period in 2015. Ongoing maintenance and other operating costs decreased $25 thousand while net losses on property sales or valuation adjustments increased $90 thousand when comparing the current quarter to the same period last year.     

Other expenses decreased $16 thousand, or 5.0%, in the current quarter compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2015, primarily related to the one-time costs to close the Towamencin Office in the third quarter of 2015 of $47 thousand; partially offset by increased loan and deposit generation costs of $18 thousand and contribution costs to educational improvement organizations of $13 thousand incurred in the current quarter.     

 Nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to prior year  

Salaries and employee benefits increased $375 thousand, or 6.6%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015 due to incremental staffing costs and related payroll taxes to enhance business development opportunities, increased bonus and stock based compensation expenses and higher employee healthcare costs; partially offset by lower wealth management commissions paid.     

Occupancy and equipment costs declined $78 thousand, or 5.1%, due to lower lease costs related to the Towamencin and Plumstead Office closures and related lower depreciation and utilities costs.      

Marketing, advertising and business development expenses decreased $40 thousand, or 19.2%, for the period ended September 30, 2016.  2015 included business development and marketing campaigns designed to take advantage of bank acquisitions announced during that time within the Bank s markets.     

FDIC insurance assessments, calculated based on asset size and equity levels of the Bank, decreased $33 thousand, or 12.6%, due to a decline in the corresponding rate used by the FDIC to calculate the insurance premiums when comparing the two periods.     

The Pennsylvania bank shares tax expense, calculated based on equity levels of the Bank, decreased $36 thousand, or 12.8%, in 2016 compared to the prior year, due to a decrease in equity capital related to the Company s repayment of preferred stock and a prior year overpayment.     

Other real estate owned costs increased by $110 thousand, or 46.2%, in 2016 compared to the prior year.  Ongoing maintenance and other operating costs increased $52 thousand while net losses on property sales or valuation adjustments increased $74 thousand when comparing the current year to the same period last year.  At the same time, acquisition and legal related costs declined $6 thousand and incremental rental income collected increased $10 thousand     

Provision for Income Taxes  
 Income tax expense recorded in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $218 thousand and $715 thousand compared to $240 thousand and $681 thousand for the three and nine months ended 2015.  The Company s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 31.4%, and was 31.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
 The Company s net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards totaled $5.1 million as of September 30, 2016, including acquired NOLs. First Priority had NOL carryforwards of $3.1 million at September 30, 2016, which expire in 2028 through 2034; such NOL carryforwards, however, are available prior to expiration to reduce future federal income taxes until such time as the entire NOL is utilized.  
   
 42 

First Priority acquired a NOL for tax purposes related t  o the acquisition of Prestige Community Bank, which initially totaled $2.0 million, with a remaining balance of $1.4 million at September 30, 2016, which is subject to certain limitations and expires in 2027 through 2028 if not fully utilized. In addition,   an initial NOL carryforward balance of $940 thousand was recorded resulting from the merger with Affinity, of which $615 thousand remains available to reduce future federal income taxes as of September 30, 2016. This NOL is also subject to certain limitat  ions and expires in 2031 through 2032 if not fully utilized.   
 Financial Condition as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 
 Balance Sheet Review 

Total assets at September 30, 2016 were $572.0 million, representing an increase of $25.4 million or 4.7% when compared to total assets of $546.5 million at December 31, 2015.  Total assets at September 30, 2016 consisted primarily of loans outstanding of $487.3 million, investment securities of $44.1 million and cash and cash equivalents of $24.9 million. At December 31, 2015, total assets consisted primarily of loans outstanding of $409.2 million, investment securities of $114.6 million and cash and cash equivalents of $5.9 million.  
 Deposits totaled $442.7 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $408.7 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $34.0 million, or 8.3%. Of the total deposits at September 30, 2016, $209.8 million, or 47.4% of total deposits, are core deposits consisting of demand, money market and savings deposits, which increased $34.4 million, or 19.6% compared to core deposits of $175.3 million at December 31, 2015.  
 Advances from Federal Home Bank of Pittsburgh totaled $70.7 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $74.7 million at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $4.0 million, or 5.4% while subordinated debt remained flat at $9.2 million when comparing these same periods.  
   
 43 

Shareholders  equity at September 30, 2016 was $47.6 million, representing a decrease of $4  .5 million from $52.1 million at December 31, 2015, primarily related to the redemption of preferred stock totaling $6.0 million in January 2016.    
 Investments  
 First Priority s total investment portfolio was $44.1 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $114.6 million at December 31, 2015, a decline of $70.5 million, or 61.5%. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company sold long duration state and municipal obligations with a book value of $12.8 million in order to take advantage of favorable market conditions.  Also, as of December 31, 2015, the investment portfolio included $50 million of short-term investments, consisting of United States Treasury securities and Federal Home Loan Bank notes, which were purchased related to year-end tax planning strategies and subsequently matured in January of 2016.  Additional matured or called securities totaled $6.8 million during the first nine months of 2016. 
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, investments totaling $24.8 million and $94.7 million, respectively, were classified as available for sale while $19.3 million and $19.9 million, respectively, were classified as held to maturity. Total investments accounted for 7.7% and 21.0% of total assets at each respective date.  
 The Company previously transferred investment securities from available for sale to held to maturity securities.  Due to these transfers, securities classified as held to maturity have net unrealized holding gains, before taxes, totaling $21 thousand as of September 30, 2016, which are being amortized over the remaining life of the related securities as an adjustment of yield in a manner consistent with the accretion of discount on debt securities. This will have no impact on the Company s net income because the amortization of the unrealized holding gains reported in equity will offset the effect on interest income of the accretion of the discount on these securities. The transfer of securities from available for sale to held to maturity was completed in order to mitigate the volatility to common equity caused by sudden market fluctuations and to lock in a predictable earnings on these related securities.  
 Securities classified as available for sale are accounted for at fair value, with the difference between fair value and amortized cost reflected in the capital account as other comprehensive income or loss. The Company had net unrealized gains on available for sale securities totaling $401 thousand at September 30, 2016 compared to $315 thousand at December 31, 2015. Available for sale securities are securities that management intends to hold for an indefinite period of time or securities that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment expectations, capital management and liquidity needs.  
 The total investment portfolio at September 30, 2016 was comprised of federal agency securities (16%), federal agency mortgage backed securities and federal agency collateralized mortgage obligations (33%), obligations of states and political subdivisions (45%), and corporate and other debt securities (6%). All investment securities were either government guaranteed, issued by a government agency or investment grade. First Priority had no investment securities deemed to have other than temporary impairment ( OTTI ) at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015 and recorded no OTTI charges during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

The following table sets forth information about the contractual maturities and weighted average yields of investm  ent securities at September 30, 2016. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities due to scheduled principal payments and unscheduled prepayments of mortgage backed securities and, where applicable, the ability of an issuer to call a security   prior to the contractual maturity date.   

The amortized cost and fair value of First Priority s investments, classified as available for sale or held to maturity, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are shown in the following table:  

45 

Restricted investments in bank stocks   
 Restricted investments in bank stocks represent the investment in the common stock of correspondent banks required in order to transact business with those banks. Investments in restricted stock are carried at cost.  
 At both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Bank held $110 thousand in common stock of Atlantic Community Bancshares, Inc. (parent company of Atlantic Community Bankers Bank), Camp Hill, Pennsylvania. Additionally, First Priority had investments in the common stock of the FHLB Bank of Pittsburgh totaling $3.22 million and $3.26 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The slight decrease is attributable to lower investments required to support the decreased level of borrowings.  
 Loans  
 First Priority s loan portfolio is the primary component of its assets. At September 30, 2016, total loans were $487.3 million, representing an increase of $78.2 million, or 19.1%, from total loans outstanding of $409.2 million at December 31, 2015. During the first nine months of 2016 loan growth included an acquired commercial loan portfolio totaling $64.4 million in the third quarter and the purchase of performing residential real estate loans totaling $12.7 million in the second quarter of 2016.  During the current year, new organic loan production totaled approximately $49 million while the Company experienced approximately $48 million in principal payments or unscheduled loan payoffs.  The following table sets forth the classification of First Priority s loan portfolio at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

Commercial mortgage loans consist of loans originated for commercial purposes which are secured by nonfarm, nonresidential properties, multifamily residential properties, or 1-4 family residential properties. As of September 30, 2016, commercial mortgage loans totaled $224.4 million, consisting of $139.3 million of loans to finance commercial business properties, of which 60% are owner occupied, $16.3 million to finance, and are secured by, multifamily properties, $53.2 million secured by 1-4 family residential dwelling properties for business purposes, and $15.6 million for other purposes. In addition, as of September 30, 2016, loans to lessors of non-residential buildings totaled $79.1 million, which is included in commercial mortgage loans; of this amount, $36.8 million, or 46%, of these loans are related to owner occupied buildings.  
 As of December 31, 2015, commercial mortgage loans totaled $179.4 million, consisting of $121.3 million of loans to finance commercial business properties, of which 60% are owner occupied, $17.3 million to finance, and are secured by, multifamily properties, $36.2 million secured by 1-4 family residential dwelling properties for business purposes, and $4.6 million for other purposes. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, loans to lessors of non-residential buildings totaled $74.1 million, which is included in commercial mortgage loans; of this amount, $35.4 million, or 48%, of these loans are related to owner occupied buildings.  
 The payment experience of certain non-owner occupied commercial mortgage loans may be dependent upon the successful operation of the real estate project. These risks can be significantly affected by supply and demand conditions in the market for office and retail space and for apartments and, as such, may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the economy. In dealing with these risk factors, First Priority generally limits itself to a real estate market or to borrowers with which First Priority has experience. First Priority generally concentrates on originating commercial real estate loans secured by properties located within its market area, and many of First Priority s commercial real estate loans are secured by owner-occupied property with personal guarantees of the debt.  
   
 46 

Regulatory guidance exists whereby total construction, land development and other land loans should not exceed 100% of total risk based capital and further guidance whereby total constr  uction, land development and other land loans combined with real estate loans secured by multifamily or nonresidential properties and loans to finance commercial real estate or construction loans (not secured by real estate) should not exceed 300% of total   risk-based capital. The Bank monitors these two ratios, which as of September 30, 2016, totaled 70% and 216% of total risk-based capital, respectively, both well within the regulatory suggested guidance.   
 Credit Quality  
 The Bank s written lending policies require specified underwriting, loan documentation and credit analysis standards to be met prior to funding, with additional credit department approval for the majority of new loan balances. The Loan Committee is comprised of senior members of management who oversee the loan approval process to monitor that proper standards are maintained.  
 The following table summarizes non-performing assets and performing troubled debt restructurings at the dates indicated. 

(1)   
 
 Non-performing loans are comprised of (i) loans that have a non-accrual status; (ii) accruing loans that are 90 days or more past due and (iii) non-performing troubled debt restructured loans.     

(2)   
 
 Repossessed assets include personal property, consisting of manufactured housing, which has been acquired for debts previously contracted.     

(3)   
 
 Non-performing assets are comprised of non-performing loans, other real estate owned (assets acquired in foreclosure) and repossessed assets.     

(4)   
 
 Performing troubled debt restructurings are accruing loans that have been restructured in troubled debt restructurings and are in compliance with their modified terms.     

 Total non-performing loans were $1.0 million at September 30, 2016, a decrease of $930 thousand from the $1.9 million at December 31, 2015. This decrease included a loan relationship totaling $1.0 million which was restored to accruing as a performing TDR.  Additionally, three loan relationships with property fair values totaling $342 thousand were transferred to other real estate owned while charge-offs in the first nine months of 2016 totaled $222 thousand.  There were two additional non-accrual commercial loans totaling $711 thousand related to commercial businesses which have experienced financial difficulty.  Total non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans at September 30, 2016 was 0.21%, compared to 0.47% at December 31, 2015.  
 Other real estate owned totaled $1.5 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $1.6 million at December 31, 2015.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 there were no repossessed assets.  Nonperforming assets totaled $2.6 million, or 0.45% of total assets, as of September 30, 2016, compared to $3.6 million, or 0.65% of total assets as of December 31, 2015.  
 While not considered non-performing, First Priority s performing troubled debt restructurings are closely monitored as they consist of loans that have been modified where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. Troubled debt restructurings may be deemed to have a higher risk of loss than loans which have not been restructured. At September 30, 2016 First Priority s performing troubled debt restructurings totaled $2.2 million and $2.6 million as of December 31, 2015.   
   
 47 

The Bank s management continues to monitor and explore potential options and re  medial actions to recover the Bank s investment in non-performing loans. According to policy, the Bank is required to maintain a specific reserve for impaired loans. See the  Allowance for Loan Losses  section below for further information.   
 The Bank s total delinquency amount is comprised of loans past due 30 to 89 days and still accruing plus the balance of nonperforming loans. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, loans past due 30 to 89 days and still accruing totaled $358 thousand and $1.0 million, respectively, which when added to the non-performing loans for each period, resulted in a total delinquency ratio of 0.28% and 0.73%, respectively, of total loans outstanding. 
 Allowance for Loan Losses  
 The allowance for loan losses represents an amount that First Priority believes will be adequate to absorb estimated credit losses on loans that may become impaired. While First Priority applies the methodology discussed below in connection with the establishment of the allowance for loan losses, the allowance is subject to critical judgments on the part of management. Risks within the loan portfolio are analyzed on a continuous basis by management, periodically analyzed by an external independent loan review function, and are also reviewed by the audit committee. A risk system, consisting of multiple grading categories, is utilized as an analytical tool to assess risk and appropriate allowances. In addition to the risk system, management further evaluates the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio under current and anticipated economic conditions and considers such factors as the financial condition of the borrower, past and expected loss experience, and other factors which management believes deserve recognition in establishing an appropriate allowance. These estimates are reviewed at least quarterly, and, as adjustments become necessary, they are realized in the periods in which they become known.  
 First Priority uses a quantitative and qualitative method to allocating its allowance to the various loan categories. An unallocated component, which is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management s estimate of probable losses, reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio.  Additions to the allowance are made by provisions charged to expense, and the allowance is reduced by net charge-offs, which are loans judged to be uncollectible, less any recoveries on loans previously charged off. Although management attempts to maintain the allowance at an adequate level, future additions to the allowance may be required due to the growth of the loan portfolio, changes in asset quality, changes in market conditions and other factors. Additionally, various regulatory agencies periodically review the allowance for loan losses. These agencies may require additional provisions based upon their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination. Although management uses what it believes to be the best information available, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate which is subject to significant judgment and short-term change.  
   
 48 

The following table sets forth a summary of the changes in the allow  ance for loan losses for the periods indicated:   

(1)   
 
 Includes non-accrual loans     

 The allowance for loan losses was $3.3 million and $2.8 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which represented 0.68% of total loans outstanding at both respective dates. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the unamortized portion of the general credit fair value adjustment totaled $34 thousand and $174 thousand, respectively, and the total specific credit market valuation adjustment totaled $362 thousand as of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Additionally, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the combination of these remaining credit fair value adjustments related to acquired loans, totaling $396 thousand and $536 thousand, respectively, and the allowance for loan losses of $3.3 million and $2.8 million for each respective period, or a total of $3.7 million and $3.3 million, respectively, would equate to 0.76% and 0.81% of total loans outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Net charge-offs recorded totaled $182 thousand and $115 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
   
 49 

The following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category. The specific allocations in any particular category may be re  allocated in the future to reflect the then current conditions. Accordingly, management considers the entire allowance to be available to absorb losses in any category.   

(1)   
 
 Represents loans outstanding in each category, as of the date shown, as a percentage of total loans outstanding.     

 A specific allocation of the allowance for loan losses is established for loans that are classified as impaired or are performing troubled debt restructurings when the discounted cash flows or related collateral value of each loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan.  A specific allocation of $362 thousand has been provided on impaired loans of $3.2 million at September 30, 2016 compared to a specific allocation of $452 thousand related to $4.6 million of originated impaired loans at December 31, 2015.  
 The general allocation component of the allowance for loan losses relates to reserves established for pools of homogenous loans which includes both a qualitative and quantitative analysis. The qualitative analysis utilizes a risk matrix that incorporates qualitative and environmental factors such as: loan volume, management, loan review process, internal policies and procedures, economic environment, credit concentrations, credit quality trends, and regulatory and other external factors. These factors are each risk rated using five levels from weak to strong which could create a total qualitative factor of up to 42 basis points of gross loans, depending on individual ratings applied.  The quantitative analysis uses a historical four year rolling average loan loss experience factor which management believes is a sufficient period to properly represent swings resulting from changing economic cycles, and therefore, reflects an appropriate period of loss history for calculating the general reserve in the current environment. The cumulative results from the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the loan portfolio resulted in a general allocation portion of the allowance for loan losses totaling $1.9 million and $1.6 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
 An unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect Management s estimate of probable loss.  The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio.  The increase in the unallocated component is primarily the result of the initial incremental provision related to performing acquired loans within the third quarter of 2016. 
 These allocations could change based on general economic or environmental factors or due to a specific credit situation which could develop within the loan portfolio.  However, based on all relevant information currently available as of September 30, 2016, management believes that the allowance for loan losses of $3.3 million is adequate as of that date and the allocations described above are appropriate.  
 Loan Concentrations  
 The Company s loans consist of credits to borrowers spread over a broad range of industrial classifications. The largest concentrations of loans are to lessors of nonresidential buildings and lessors of residential buildings and dwellings. As of September 30, 2016, these loans totaled $79.1 million and $67.5 million, respectively, or 16.2% and 13.9%, respectively, of the total loans outstanding. As of December 31, 2015, these same classifications of loans totaled $74.1 million and $58.4 million, respectively, or 18.1% and 14.3%, respectively, of the total loans outstanding. These credits were subject to normal underwriting standards and did not present more than the normal amount of risk assumed by the Company s other lending activities. Management believes this concentration does not pose abnormal risk when compared to the risk it assumes in other types of lending. The Company has no other concentration of loans which exceeds 10% of total loans.  
   
 50 

Deposits   
 Deposits represent the primary source of funding for earning assets. Deposits totaled $442.7 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $408.7 million at December 31, 2015, representing an increase of $34.0 million or 8.3%. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, increases of $18.8 million, or 22.2%, in demand deposits and $15.7 million, or 17.3%, in money market deposit and savings deposits, which represents a combined $34.5 million increase, or 19.6% in non-time deposits.  Total time deposits declined $414 thousand when comparing these same periods as a decrease of $12.9 million in retail time deposits was offset by an increase in brokered time deposits of $12.5 million. 
 First Priority attracts deposits by offering competitive products and interest rates on a broad spectrum of deposit products to customers in its local marketplace, generally through its retail branch system, and also through its internet banking platform. The Bank supplements deposits raised locally with the issuance of brokered deposits when cost effective relative to local market pricing. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, brokered deposits totaled $125.8 million and $113.3 million, respectively. The guidelines governing the Bank s participation in the brokered CD market are included in the Bank s Asset Liability Management Policy, which is reviewed, revised and approved annually by the asset liability management committee and the board of directors. The FDIC places restrictions on a depository institution s use of brokered deposits based on the bank s capital classification. A well-capitalized institution may accept brokered deposits without FDIC restrictions. An adequately capitalized institution must obtain a waiver from the FDIC in order to accept brokered deposits, while an undercapitalized institution is prohibited by the FDIC from accepting brokered deposits. The Bank is classified as well-capitalized under prompt corrective action provisions (see  Regulatory Matters  of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements) and, therefore, may accept brokered deposits without FDIC restrictions.  
 The following table sets forth the average balance of deposits and the average rates paid on deposits for the periods presented.  

The maturity distribution of time deposits of $100,000 or more as of September 30, 2016, is as follows:  

Short-Term Borrowed Funds  
 At September 30, 2016, First Priority had short-term borrowings totaling $58.7 million, compared to $59.7 million at December 31, 2015. Short-term borrowings consisted of advances from the FHLB with an original maturity of one year or less as of each of these periods and provide a short-term funding source. The slight decrease of $1.0 million, or 1.7%, between periods in short-term borrowings resulted from the decline in investment securities from the prior year end, partially offset by the increase in interest bearing deposits reflected in cash and cash equivalents, and the increase in loans outstanding; all of which were not funded by deposit growth achieved during the same period.  Advances from the FHLB at September 30, 2016 are collateralized by an investment in the common stock of the FHLB, by a specific pledge of the Bank s investment assets and by a blanket lien on qualifying mortgages within the Bank s loan portfolio.  
   
 51 

The following table outlines First Priority s various sources of short-term borrowed funds at or for each of the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The maximum balance represents the highest indebtedness for each ca  tegory of short-term borrowed funds at any month-end during each of the periods shown.   

Long-Term Debt  
 Long-term debt totaled $12.0 million as of September 30, 2016 and $15.0 million at December 31, 2015.  These borrowings consisted of advances from the FHLB with an original maturity in excess of one year and carry a weighted average interest rate of 1.17% and 1.09%, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and an average remaining life of 1.5 years and 1.9 years, respectively. Advances from the FHLB are collateralized by an investment in the common stock of the FHLB, by a specific pledge of the Bank s investment assets and by a blanket lien on qualifying mortgages within the Bank s loan portfolio.  Balances of FHLB long-term debt averaged $14.8 million and $11.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, with an average rate of 1.11% and 0.89% for each of these respective periods. The maximum month-end balance of these borrowings was $15.0 million for the first nine months of 2016 and $16.0 million for the same period in 2015.  
 Subordinated Debt 
 On November 13, 2015, the Bank entered into Subordinated Note Purchase Agreements with five accredited investors under which the Bank issued subordinated notes (the  Notes ) totaling $9.5 million, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $9.2 million after issuance costs. The Notes have a maturity date of November 30, 2025, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 7.00% per annum.  The Notes are non-callable for an initial period of five years and include provisions for redemption pricing between 101.5% and 100.5% of the liquidation value, if called after five years but prior to the maturity date.  Upon receipt of regulatory approvals in December 2015, the Bank distributed $6.0 million of the proceeds from the subordinated note issuance to First Priority, and subsequently, in January 2016, First Priority utilized the distribution from the Bank to redeem 6,000 of the 9,404 outstanding shares of its 9.00% Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, at their liquidation value of $1,000 per share, or $6.0 million, plus accrued dividends. 
 Capital Resources  
 Shareholders  equity at September 30, 2016 was $47.6 million, representing a decrease of $4.5 million from $52.1 million at December 31, 2015. Included in equity as of December 31, 2015 was $9.4 million of preferred stock, of which $6.0 million was redeemed in January 2016.  Additionally, increases in equity related to net income of $1.6 million, stock based compensation costs of $253 thousand and a positive impact from market volatility related to the investment securities portfolio resulting in a net change in net unrealized gains (losses) totaling $42 thousand, were partially offset by preferred dividends paid of $330 thousand.  
 As noted above, in January 2016, First Priority utilized $6 million of the proceeds received from the issuance of Tier 2 qualifying subordinated debt to redeem 6,000 shares of the Company s outstanding preferred stock.  This redemption consisted of all outstanding shares of Series A and Series B, and 1,192 shares of the Series C preferred stock, which were redeemed on a pro rata basis, which subsequently leaves 3,404 shares of Series C outstanding. 
   
 52 

The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet the minimum capit  al requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Bank s financial condition and results of operations. Under capital adequacy guidelin  es and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting   practices. The Bank s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk-weightings and other factors.   
 The Bank exceeds the minimum capital requirements established by regulatory agencies. Under the capital adequacy guidelines, capital is classified into two tiers. These guidelines require an institution to maintain a certain level of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital to risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital consists of common shareholders  equity and qualifying preferred stock, excluding the unrealized gain or loss on securities available for sale, minus certain intangible assets plus trust preferred securities up to 25% of Tier 1 capital, with the excess being treated as Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital also consists of the allowance for loan losses, subject to certain limitations, and qualifying subordinated debt. In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets, all assets, including certain off balance sheet assets, are multiplied by a risk-weight factor of 0% to 100% based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset.  
 Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets and of Tier 1 capital to average assets, known as the Tier 1 leverage ratio. The following table sets forth the capital ratios for both First Priority and the Bank at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  First Priority currently meets the definition of a  small bank holding company  under the FRB s regulations, and thus is not subject to any capital requirements; however, the Company meets the holding company regulatory requirements for  well-capitalized  for each stated period.  The Bank was considered  well-capitalized  and met or exceeded its applicable regulatory requirements for both periods.     

The ratios shown above, for both the Company and the Bank, include the $9.5 million issuance of Tier 2 qualifying subordinated debt noted above. 
 The capital ratios above reflect the new capital requirements under "Basel III" effective during the year ended December 31, 2015.  As of September 30, 2016, the Bank and the Company were in compliance with the new requirements. See Note 10 - Regulatory Matters for additional discussion regarding regulatory capital requirements.  
 Return on Average Equity and Assets  
 The following table shows the return on average assets (net income divided by total average assets), return on equity (net income divided by average equity), and the equity to assets ratio (average equity divided by total average assets) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Effect of Inflation and Changing Prices  
 The effect of relative purchasing power over time due to inflation has not been taken into effect in First Priority s consolidated financial statements. Rather, the statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  
   
 53 

Unlike most industrial companies, the assets and liabilities of financial institutions, such as First Priority and the Bank, are primarily monetary in nature. Therefore, the effect of changes in i  nterest rates will have a more significant impact on its performance than will the effect of changing prices and inflation in general. In addition, interest rates may generally increase as the rate of inflation increases, although not necessarily in the sa  me magnitude. First Priority seeks to manage the relationships between interest-sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations, including those resulting from inflation.   
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
 Through the operations of the Bank, First Priority has made contractual commitments to extend credit, in the ordinary course of its business activities, to meet the financing needs of customers. Such commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheets. These commitments are legally binding agreements to lend money at predetermined interest rates for a specified period of time and generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. The same credit and collateral policies are used in making these commitments as for on-balance sheet instruments.  
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Each customer s creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis and collateral is obtained, if necessary, based on the credit evaluation of the borrower. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but may include personal or commercial real estate, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment.  
 At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, outstanding commitments to extend credit consisting of total unfunded commitments under lines of credit were $89.0 million and $97.8 million, respectively. In addition, as of each of these dates, the Company maintained $681 thousand and $711 thousand of performance standby letters of credit outstanding, respectively, and $1.4 million and $1.1 million of financial standby letters of credit outstanding, respectively, on behalf of its customers.  
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company also has deposit letters of credit totaling $12.2 million, issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh ( FHLB ), as required to provide collateral on certain municipal deposits maintained at the Bank.  These deposit letters of credit are secured by a blanket lien on selected mortgage loans within First Priority Bank s portfolio. 
 First Priority is not involved in any other off-balance sheet contractual relationships, unconsolidated related entities that have off-balance sheet arrangements or transactions that could result in liquidity needs or other commitments that could significantly impact earnings.  First Priority believes that it has adequate sources of liquidity to fund commitments that may be drawn upon by borrowers.  
 Liquidity  
 The objective of liquidity management is to assure that sufficient sources of funds are available, as needed and at a reasonable cost, to meet the ongoing and unexpected operational cash needs and commitments of First Priority and to take advantage of income producing opportunities as they arise. Sufficient liquidity must be available to meet the cash requirements of depositors wanting to withdraw funds and of borrowers wanting their credit needs met. Additionally, liquidity is needed to insure that First Priority has the ability to act at those times when profitable new lending and investment opportunities arise. While the desired level of liquidity may vary depending upon a variety of factors, it is a primary goal of First Priority to maintain adequate liquidity in all economic environments through active balance sheet management.  
 Liquidity management is the ongoing process of monitoring and managing First Priority s sources and uses of funds. The primary sources of funds are deposits, scheduled amortization of loans outstanding, maturities and cash flow generated from the investment portfolio and funds provided by operations. Scheduled loan payments and investment maturities are relatively predictable sources of funds; however, deposit flows and loan prepayments are far less predictable and are influenced by the level of interest rates, economic conditions, local competition and customer preferences. Liquidity is also provided by unused lines of credit with correspondent banks and First Priority s borrowing capacity at the FHLB. First Priority measures and monitors its liquidity position on an ongoing basis in order to better understand, predict and respond to balance sheet trends, unused borrowing capacity and liquidity needs. The liquidity position is managed on a daily basis as part of the daily settlement function and on an ongoing basis through the asset liability management function.  
 The key elements of First Priority s liquidity planning process involve a primary focus on the development of a stable, core funding base; utilization of wholesale funding sources to supplement core funding; maintenance of an appropriate level of asset liquidity; management of the maturity structure of funding sources and of funding concentrations; and maintenance of borrowing facilities.  
   
 54 

Wholesale funding sources utilized by the Bank include brokered certificates of deposits, secured advances from the Federal Home Loan Ban  k of Pittsburgh, federal funds purchased and other secured borrowing facilities. At September 30, 2016, wholesale funding sources totaled $196.5 million and were comprised of $125.8 million of brokered certificates of deposit and $70.7 million of FHLB adva  nces. At December 31, 2015, wholesale funding sources totaled $188.0 million and were comprised of $113.3 million of brokered certificates of deposit and $74.7 million of FHLB advances. Wholesale funding is generally used in managing the daily liquidity ne  eds and when it is the most cost effective funding source available to First Priority. Wholesale funding sources were used in the quarter to provide the initial funding for the $65 million loan purchase.  Management continually evaluates all available fund  ing sources for cost and availability.   
 An integral part of the Bank s balance sheet management strategy is to establish and maintain borrowing facilities with correspondent banks for access to funding. Off balance sheet borrowing capacity provides the immediate availability of funds to meet short-term financing needs without requiring the bank to maintain excess liquidity in its investment portfolio, which may have a negative impact on earnings. In today s environment of historically low interest rates, it also provides the most effective longer term funding, in terms of the cost and structure. Long term borrowings from the FHLB cannot be called prior to maturity, which provides much greater protection against a rise in interest rates when compared to retail deposits which can be redeemed early by the depositor at lower than market rate penalties.  
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Bank had a borrowing facility with a correspondent bank totaling $10 million, available for short-term limited purpose usage, of which $2 million is available unsecured. The remaining $8 million is a secured line of credit.  
 At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Bank had a total borrowing capacity with the FHLB of $181 million and $169 million, respectively, with advances and letters of credit outstanding of $82.9 million and $74.7 million, respectively.  Short-term liquid assets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 totaled $21.4 million and $52.4 million, respectively, and were comprised of $21.4 million and $2.4 million, respectively, of interest bearing deposits held at correspondent banks and $50 million of investment securities due within 30 days, respectively. 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity  
 It is the responsibility of the board of directors and senior management to understand and control the interest rate risk exposures assumed by First Priority. The board has delegated authority to the asset liability management committee ( ALCO ) for the development of ALCO policies and for the management of the asset liability management function. The ALCO committee is comprised of senior management representing all primary functions of First Priority and meets monthly. ALCO has the responsibility for maintaining a level of interest rate risk exposures within board of director approved limits.  
 The primary objective of asset liability management is to optimize net interest income over time while maintaining a balance sheet mix that is prudent with respect to liquidity, capital adequacy and interest rate risk. The absolute level and volatility of interest rates can have a significant impact on the profitability of First Priority. Interest rate risk management is the process of identifying and controlling the potential adverse impact of interest rates movements on First Priority s net interest income and on the fair value of its assets and liabilities.  
 One tool used to monitor interest rate risk is the measurement of its interest sensitivity  gap,  which is the positive or negative dollar difference between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that are subject to interest rate repricing within a given period of time. Interest rate sensitivity can be managed by changing the mix, pricing and repricing characteristics of First Priority s assets and liabilities, through management of its investment portfolio, loan and deposit product offerings, and through wholesale funding. Managing the amount of assets and liabilities repricing in the same time interval helps to hedge interest rate risk and minimize the impact on net interest income of rising or falling interest rates. First Priority generally would benefit from increasing market rates of interest when it has an asset-sensitive gap position and generally would benefit from decreasing market rates of interest when First Priority is liability-sensitive.  
 At September 30, 2016, First Priority was moderately liability sensitive at the one-year gap position, as it has more liabilities subject to repricing in the subsequent twelve month period than assets. It must be noted, however, that the gap analysis is not a precise indicator of First Priority s exposure to changing interest rates. The analysis presents only a static view of the timing of maturities and repricing opportunities, without taking into consideration that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally. Furthermore, the results are influenced by management assumptions concerning the repricing characteristics of deposit products with no contractual maturities, the timing of the repricing of variable rate loans with interest rates currently fixed at interest rate floors, and prepayment speeds of loans and investments subject to prepayment prior to maturity. Additionally, net interest income performance may be impacted by other significant factors in a given interest rate environment, including changes in the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  
 Risk identification and management are essential elements for the successful management of First Priority. In the normal course of business, First Priority is subject to various types of risk, including interest rate, credit, and liquidity risk. First Priority controls and monitors these risks with policies, procedures, and various levels of managerial and board oversight. First Priority s objective is to optimize profitability while managing and controlling risk within board approved policy limits. Interest rate risk is the sensitivity of net interest income and the market value of financial instruments to the magnitude, direction, and frequency of changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk results from various repricing frequencies and the maturity structure of assets and liabilities. First Priority uses its asset liability management policy to control and manage interest rate risk.  
 Liquidity risk represents the inability to generate cash or otherwise obtain funds at reasonable rates to satisfy commitments to borrowers, as well as, the obligations to depositors and debt holders. First Priority uses its asset liability management policy and contingency funding plan to control and manage liquidity risk.  
 Credit risk represents the possibility that a customer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms. Credit risk results from extending credit to customers, purchasing securities, and entering into certain off-balance sheet loan funding commitments. First Priority s primary credit risk occurs in the loan portfolio. First Priority uses its credit policy and disciplined approach to evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses to control and manage credit risk. First Priority s investment policy limits the degree of the amount of credit risk that may be assumed in the investment portfolio. First Priority s principal financial market risks are liquidity risks and exposures to interest rate movements.  

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures  
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, these disclosure controls and procedures are effective.  
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  
 There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) during the fiscal period to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
