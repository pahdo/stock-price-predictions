  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 
  FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 
  (In millions, except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated) 

Note 1  .    Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for Quad/Graphics, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company" or "Quad/Graphics") have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations for interim financial information of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("  SEC  ").  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("  GAAP  ") have been omitted pursuant to such   SEC   rules and regulations.  The results of operations and accounts of businesses acquired are included in the condensed consolidated financial statements from the dates of acquisition (see   Note 2  , "  Acquisitions and Strategic Investments  ").  During 2016, the Company modified its presentation of byproduct recoveries to include byproduct recoveries as a reduction of cost of sales products in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.  Previously, byproduct recoveries were reported in net sales products.  Classification of byproduct recoveries as a reduction of cost of sales aligns the proceeds from byproduct recoveries with the corresponding manufacturing costs.  The condensed consolidated statements of operations and corresponding notes to the financial statements for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , have been reclassified to reflect this change in presentation.  This reclassification had no impact on operating income (loss) or net earnings (loss) in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.  These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated annual financial statements as of and for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , and notes thereto included in the Company's latest Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the   SEC   on   February 23, 2016  . 
    
  The Company is subject to seasonality in its quarterly results as net sales and operating income are higher in the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year as compared to the first and second quarters.  The fourth quarter is the highest seasonal quarter for cash flows from operating activities due to the reduction of working capital requirements that reach peak levels during the third quarter.  Seasonality is driven by increased magazine advertising page counts, retail inserts, catalogs and books primarily due to back-to-school and holiday-related advertising and promotions.  The Company expects this seasonality impact to continue in future years. 
    
  The financial information contained herein reflects all adjustments, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the Company's results of operations for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  All of these adjustments are of a normal recurring nature, except as otherwise noted.  All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include estimates and assumptions of management that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements.  Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

Note 2  .    Acquisitions and Strategic Investments 
    
  2015 Specialty Finishing, Inc. Acquisition 
       
  The Company completed the acquisition of Specialty Finishing, Inc. ("  Specialty  ") on   August 25, 2015  , for   $61.0 million  .

The purchase price of   $61.0 million   included   $0.3 million   of acquired cash for a net purchase price of   $60.7 million  .

The final allocation of the purchase price was based on valuations performed to determine the fair value of the net assets as of the acquisition date.  The net assets acquired, excluding acquired cash, were classified as Level 3 in the valuation hierarchy (see   Note 12  , "  Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements  ," for the definition of Level 3 inputs).  Specialty's operations are included in the United States Print and Related Services segment.

Marin's products are produced by a global network of licensees, including Quad/Graphics, as well as one wide-format digital print, kitting and fulfillment facility in Paris.  Marin's uses its own European based sales force and the global licensees to sell its patented product portfolio.  The purchase price of   $31.1 million   included   $10.1 million   of acquired cash for a net purchase price of   $21.0 million  .  Included in the purchase price allocation are   $17.9 million   of identifiable intangible assets, which are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from   three   to   eight years  , and   $6.8 million   of goodwill.  The final allocation of the purchase price was based on valuations performed to determine the fair value of the net assets as of the acquisition date.  The net assets acquired, excluding acquired cash, were classified as Level 3 in the valuation hierarchy (see   Note 12  , "  Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements  ," for the definition of Level 3 inputs).  Marin's operations are included in the International segment.

  (In millions, except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated) 

Restructuring Charges 
    
  Since 2010, the Company has implemented restructuring programs to eliminate excess manufacturing capacity and properly align its cost structure.  The Company has announced a total of   33   plant closures and has reduced headcount by approximately   11,000   employees since   2010  .  The Company announced the closures of the Atglen, Pennsylvania and Lenexa, Kansas plants during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  The Company recorded the following charges as a result of plant closures and other restructuring programs: 

Employee termination charges of   $1.5 million   and   $8.1 million   were recorded during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $9.0 million   and   $21.5 million   were recorded during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.  The Company reduced its workforce through facility consolidations and involuntary separation programs. 

There were   no   integration costs recorded during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  .  Integration costs of   $0.1 million   were recorded during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  Integration costs of   $0.6 million   and   $4.4 million   were recorded during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively, and were primarily related to preparing existing facilities to meet new production requirements resulting from work transferring from closed plants, as well as other costs related to the integration of acquired companies. 

Other restructuring charges of   $23.3 million   and   $34.6 million   were recorded during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, which consisted of the following: (1)   $2.3 million   and   $9.4 million  , respectively, of vacant facility carrying costs; (2)   $0.6 million   and   $4.4 million  , respectively, of equipment and infrastructure removal costs from closed plants; and (3)   $2.7 million   and   $3.1 million  , respectively, of lease exit charges primarily related to the lease termination of the Pittsburg, California facility.  The Company also recorded an   $11.2 million   adjustment to its multiemployer pension plans withdrawal liability during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and a   $6.5 million   non-cash pension settlement charge related to lump-sum pension payments during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , (see   Note 14  , "  Employee Retirement Plans  ," for additional details).  Other restructuring charges of   $9.3 million   and   $21.5 million  , respectively, were recorded during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , which consisted of the following: (1)   $2.6 million   and   $9.3 million  , respectively, of vacant facility carrying costs; (2)   $0.3 million   and   $1.6 million  , respectively, of equipment and infrastructure removal costs from closed plants; and (3)   $0.4 million   and   $4.6 million  , respectively, of lease exit charges primarily related to the closure of the Atlanta, Georgia facility.  The Company also recorded a   $6.0 million   non-cash expense during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , to recognize accumulated foreign exchange losses on the sale of the Chile equity method investment (see   Note 7  , "  Equity Method Investments in Unconsolidated Entities  ," for additional details). 
       
  The restructuring charges recorded were based on plans that have been committed to by management and were, in part, based upon management's best estimates of future events.  Changes to the estimates may require future restructuring charges and adjustments to the restructuring liabilities.  The Company expects to incur additional restructuring charges related to these and other initiatives. 
    
  Impairment Charges 
    
  The Company recognized impairment charges of   $0.9 million   and   $17.7 million   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, which consisted of the following: (1)   $12.1 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , of land and building impairment charges related to the Atglen, Pennsylvania plant closure; and (2)   $0.9 million   and   $5.6 million   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, of impairment charges primarily for machinery and equipment no longer being utilized in production as a result of facility consolidations, including Atglen, Pennsylvania; Augusta, Georgia; East Greenville, Pennsylvania; and Queretaro, Mexico, as well as other capacity reduction restructuring activities.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 
  FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 
  (In millions, except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated) 

The Company recognized impairment charges of   $15.8 million   and   $39.9 million   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively, which consisted of the following: (1)   $16.7 million   of impairment charges recorded in the second quarter of 2015 to reduce the book value of the Company's equity method investment in Chile to fair value (see   Note 7  , "  Equity Method Investments in Unconsolidated Entities  ," for additional details related to the impairment of the Company's equity method investment in Chile); (2)   $15.8 million   and   $21.0 million  , respectively, of impairment charges for machinery and equipment no longer being utilized in production as a result of facility consolidations, including Atlanta, Georgia; Dickson, Tennessee; and Queretaro, Mexico, as well as other capacity reduction restructuring initiatives; and (3)   $2.2 million   of impairment charges recorded in the first quarter of 2015 for property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets as a result of the restructuring proceedings in Argentina for the Company's Argentina subsidiaries, World Color Argentina, S.A. and Anselmo L. Morvillo S.A. (the "  Argentina Subsidiaries  "). 
    
  The fair values of the impaired assets were determined by the Company to be Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy (see   Note 12  , "  Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements  ," for the definition of Level 3 inputs) and were estimated based on broker quotes, internally developed models based on current marketplace conditions and estimated future discounted cash flows.  These assets were adjusted to their estimated fair values at the time of impairment. 
    
  The non-cash goodwill impairment charges included in the line item entitled goodwill impairment on the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations are discussed in   Note 4  , "  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  ." 
    
  Transaction-Related Charges (Income) 
    
  The Company incurs transaction-related charges (income) primarily consisting of professional service fees related to business acquisition and divestiture activities.  The Company recognized transaction-related charges of   $0.4 million   and   $1.9 million   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively.  The Company recognized transaction-related charges of   $0.9 million   and income of   $7.3 million   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively, which, in the nine month period, included a   $10.0 million   non-recurring gain as a result of Courier Corporation's ("  Courier  ") termination of the agreement pursuant to which Quad/Graphics was to acquire   Courier  , partially offset by   $2.7 million   of professional service fees primarily for the terminated acquisition of   Courier   and for the acquisitions of   Marin's  ,   Copac   and   Specialty  .  The transaction-related charges were expensed as incurred in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on business combinations. 
    
  Reserves for Restructuring, Impairment and Transaction-Related Charges 
    
  Activity impacting the Company's reserves for restructuring, impairment and transaction-related charges for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , was as follows:

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 
  FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 
  (In millions, except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated) 

The Company's restructuring, impairment and transaction-related reserves at   September 30, 2016  , included a short-term and a long-term component.  The short-term portion included   $9.4 million   in accrued liabilities and   $1.1 million   in accounts payable in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as the Company expects these reserves to be paid within the next twelve months.  The long-term portion of   $15.9 million   is included in other long-term liabilities (see   Note 13  , "  Other Long-Term Liabilities  ") in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

Note 4  .    Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
    
  Goodwill 
    
  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination.  Goodwill is assigned to specific reporting units and is tested annually for impairment as of   October 31   or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. 
    
  United States Print and Related Services Segment 
    
  Due to the decline in the Company's stock price in the third quarter of 2015, an interim goodwill impairment test of the   three   reporting units in the United States Print and Related Services segment was performed as of   July 31, 2015  .  These reporting units include the Core Print and Related Services reporting unit, the Specialty Print and Related Services reporting unit and the Other United States Products and Services reporting unit, with goodwill of   $640.8 million  ,   $115.6 million   and   $18.6 million  , respectively, as of   July 31, 2015  . 
    
  As a result of the interim goodwill assessment, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash goodwill impairment charge of    $775.0 million   as of September 30, 2015, for the   three   reporting units within the United States Print and Related Services segment. 
    
  International Segment 
    
  On March 25, 2015, due to deteriorating economic conditions, including inflation and currency devaluation, combined with uncertain political conditions, declining print volume and labor challenges, the Company's Argentina Subsidiaries (included within the Latin America reporting unit) commenced bankruptcy restructuring proceedings with a goal of consolidating operations.  As a result, the Company conducted an interim goodwill impairment assessment of the Latin America reporting unit, which included comparing the carrying amount of net assets, including goodwill, to its respective fair value as of March 31, 2015, the date of the interim assessment. 
    
  The Company recorded a   $23.3 million   non-cash goodwill impairment charge as a result of the March 31, 2015, interim goodwill impairment assessment for the Latin America reporting unit within the International segment. 
    
  The goodwill impairment charges in both segments resulted from a reduction in estimated fair value of each reporting unit based on lower expectations for future revenue, profitability and cash flows as compared to expectations in the previous annual goodwill impairment assessment performed as of October 31, 2014.  Further information relating to fair value determinations and assumptions used in the calculation of the Company's 2015 goodwill impairment is contained within Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," of the Company's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 23, 2016.

  FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 
  (In millions, except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated) 

No   goodwill impairment was recorded for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  Non-cash goodwill impairment charges of   $775.0 million   and   $798.3 million   were recorded during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.  All remaining goodwill was impaired in the fourth quarter of   2015  , and the accumulated goodwill impairment losses and the carrying value of goodwill at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , were as follows: 

Other Intangible Assets 
    
  The components of other intangible assets at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , were as follows: 

The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization within other intangible assets net in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , differs from the value originally recorded at acquisition due to impairment charges recorded and the effects of currency fluctuations between the purchase date and   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Other intangible assets are evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  There were   no   impairment charges recorded on other intangible assets for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  .  The Company recorded other intangible asset impairment charges of   $0.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , (see   Note 3  , "  Restructuring, Impairment and Transaction-Related Charges  ," for further discussion on impairment charges).

The Company recorded impairment charges of   $0.9 million   and   $17.7 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $9.8 million   and   $17.1 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively, to reduce the carrying amounts of certain property, plant and equipment no longer utilized in production to fair value (see   Note 3  , "  Restructuring, Impairment and Transaction-Related Charges  ," for further discussion on impairment charges). 
    
  The Company recognized depreciation expense of   $57.0 million   and   $171.3 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $60.2 million   and   $185.3 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Assets Held for Sale 
    
  The Company considered certain closed facilities for held for sale classification on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  The net book value of assets held for sale was   $11.4 million   and   $6.3 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  These assets were carried at the lesser of original cost or fair value, less the estimated costs to sell.  The fair values were determined by the Company to be Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy (see   Note 12  , "  Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements  ," for the definition of Level 3 inputs) and were estimated based on broker quotes and internally developed models based on current marketplace conditions.  Assets held for sale are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

Note 7  .    Equity Method Investments in Unconsolidated Entities 
    
  The Company has a   49%   ownership interest in Plural Industria Gr fica Ltda. ("Plural"), a commercial printer based in S o Paulo, Brazil.  The Company had a   50%   ownership interest in Quad/Graphics Chile S.A. ("Chile"), a commercial printer based in Santiago, Chile, until the Company sold its ownership interest in Chile on   July 31, 2015  .  The Company's ownership interest in Plural and Chile was accounted for using the equity method of accounting for all periods presented.  The Company's equity loss of Plural's and Chile's operations was recorded in equity in loss of unconsolidated entities in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations and was included within the International segment. 
    
  The Company reviews its equity method investments regularly for indicators of other than temporary impairment.  During the second quarter of 2015, the Company recorded a   $16.7 million   impairment charge to reduce the book value of the   50%   ownership interest in Chile to fair value based on the intent to sell the investment.  The impairment was recorded in restructuring, impairment and transaction-related charges on the condensed consolidated statement of operations and was included within the International segment.  The fair value measurement of the investment, which was classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy (see   Note 12  , "  Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements  ," for the definition of Level 3 inputs), was determined using internal expertise of current marketplace conditions. 
    
  On July 31, 2015, the Company sold its   50%   ownership interest in Chile for   $10.5 million  .  The Company recorded a   $6.0 million   non-cash expense to recognize accumulated foreign exchange losses on the sale of the Chile equity method investment during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , which was recorded within restructuring, impairment and transaction-related charges on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Note 8  .    Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Litigation 
    
  The Company is named as a defendant in various lawsuits in which claims are asserted against the Company in the normal course of business.  The liabilities, if any, which may ultimately result from such lawsuits are not expected by management to have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company. 
    
  In April 2016, the Company self-reported to the SEC and the Department of Justice ("DOJ") certain Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") issues related to its Peru operations.  The Company's Peru operations had approximate annual sales ranging from   $55 million   to   $85 million   since the date that the Company acquired those operations in July 2010.  The self-reported issues were identified by the Company's financial internal controls.  The Company, under the oversight of its Audit Committee and Board of Directors, proactively initiated an investigation into this matter with the assistance of external legal counsel and external forensic accountants.  In connection with this investigation, the Company has made and continues to evaluate certain enhancements to its compliance program.  The Company is fully cooperating with the SEC and the DOJ.  At this time, the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effect on its business or financial condition as a result of this matter. 
    
  Environmental Reserves 
    
  The Company is subject to various laws, regulations and government policies relating to health and safety, to the generation, storage, transportation, and disposal of hazardous substances, and to environmental protection in general.  The Company provides for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated.  Such reserves are adjusted as new information develops or as circumstances change.  The environmental reserves are not discounted.  The Company believes it is in compliance with such laws, regulations and government policies in all material respects.  Furthermore, the Company does not anticipate that maintaining compliance with such environmental statutes will have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial position. 

Note 9  .    World Color Press Inc. Insolvency Proceedings 
    
  The Company continues to manage the bankruptcy claim settlement process for the Quebecor World Inc. ("  QWI  ") bankruptcy proceedings in the United States and Canada (QWI changed its name to World Color Press Inc. ("  World Color Press  ") upon emerging from bankruptcy on   July 21, 2009  ).  To the extent claims are allowed, the holders of such claims are entitled to receive recovery, with the nature of such recovery dependent upon the type and classification of such claims.  In this regard, with respect to certain types of claims, the holders thereof are entitled to receive cash and/or unsecured notes, while the holders of certain other types of claims are entitled to receive a combination of Quad/Graphics common stock and cash (the "Class 4 Claims"), in accordance with the terms of the   World Color Press   acquisition agreement.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 
  FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 
  (In millions, except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated) 

With respect to claims asserted by the holders thereof as being entitled to a priority cash recovery, the Company has estimated that approximately   $1.2 million   and   $1.4 million   of such recorded claims have yet to be paid as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  With respect to claims asserted by the holders thereof as being entitled to Class 4 Claims, during the second quarter of 2016 the Company was provided   $1.1 million   of restricted cash to satisfy the cash portion of the remaining Class 4 Claims.  The obligations for both the priority cash claims and the Class 4 Claims are classified as amounts owing in satisfaction of bankruptcy claims in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  With respect to unsecured claims held by creditors of the operating subsidiary debtors of Quebecor World (USA) Inc. (the "Class 3 Claims"), each allowed Class 3 Claim will be entitled to receive an unsecured note in an amount equaling   50%   of such creditor's allowed Class 3 Claim, provided, however, that the aggregate principal amount of all such unsecured notes cannot exceed   $75.0 million  .  Each allowed Class 3 Claim will also receive accrued interest and a   5%   prepayment redemption premium thereon (the total aggregate maximum principal, interest and prepayment redemption premium for all Class 3 Claims is   $89.2 million  ).  In connection with the   World Color Press   acquisition, the Company was required to deposit the maximum potential payout to the Class 3 Claim creditors of   $89.2 million   with a trustee, and that amount will remain with the trustee until either (1) it is paid to a creditor for an allowed Class 3 Claim or (2) excess amounts not required for Class 3 Claim payments will revert to the Company. 
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   $0.3 million   was paid to Class 3 Claim creditors, and   no   refunds of restricted cash were received.  At   September 30, 2016  , an   $11.5 million   maximum potential payout to the Class 3 Claim creditors remained and was classified as restricted cash in the condensed consolidated balance sheet.  Based on the Company's analysis of the outstanding Class 3 claims, the Company had a liability of   $6.8 million   at   September 30, 2016  , classified as unsecured notes to be issued in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  Activity impacting restricted cash and unsecured notes to be issued for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , was as follows: 

The components of restricted cash at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , were as follows: 

While the liabilities recorded for any bankruptcy matters are based on management's current assessment of the amount likely to be paid, it is not possible to identify the final amount of priority cash claims, Class 4 claims or Class 3 claims that will ultimately be allowed by the United States Bankruptcy Court.  Therefore, payments for amounts owing in satisfaction of bankruptcy claims could be higher than the amounts accrued on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, which would require additional cash payments to be made and expense to be recorded for the amount exceeding the Company's estimate.  Amounts payable related to the unsecured notes could exceed current estimates, which would require additional expense to be recorded.  The Company has resolved the majority of claims since acquiring   World Color Press   in 2010, but the ultimate timing for completion of the bankruptcy process depends on the resolution of the remaining claims.

Note 10  .    Debt 
    
  The components of long-term debt as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , were as follows: 

Gain on Debt Extinguishment 
    
  The gain on debt extinguishment recorded during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , was as follows: 

Master Note and Security Agreement Tender 
    
  The Company redeemed   $60.1 million   of its senior notes under the Master Note and Security Agreement, resulting in a net loss on debt extinguishment of   $0.2 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  All tendered senior notes under the Master Note and Security Agreement were canceled.  The Company used cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under its revolving credit facility to fund the tender.  The tender was primarily completed to reallocate debt to the lower interest rate revolving credit facility and thereby reduce interest expense based on current London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") rates.

Senior Unsecured Note Repurchases 
    
  The Company repurchased   $56.5 million   of its   $300.0 million   aggregate principal amount of unsecured   7.0%   senior notes due   May 1, 2022  , (the "  Senior Unsecured Notes  ") in the open market, resulting in a net gain on debt extinguishment of   $14.3 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  All repurchased Senior Unsecured Notes were canceled.  The Company used cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under its revolving credit facility to fund the repurchases.  These repurchases were primarily completed to efficiently reduce debt balances and interest expense based on current LIBOR rates. 
    
  International Debt Obligations 
    
  The Company entered into a fixed rate Euro denominated international term loan on December 28, 2015, for purposes of financing certain capital expenditures and general business needs.  The international term loan was fully funded during 2016 and had   $17.9 million   outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of   1.72%   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Fair Value of Debt 
    
  Based upon the interest rates available to the Company for borrowings with similar terms and maturities, the fair value of the Company's total debt was approximately   $1.2 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  .  The fair value determination of the Company's total debt was categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy (see   Note 12  , "  Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements  ," for the definition of Level 2 inputs). 
    
  Covenants and Compliance 
    
  The Company's various lending arrangements include certain financial covenants (all financial terms, numbers and ratios are as defined in the Company's debt agreements).  Among these covenants, the Company was required to maintain the following as of   September 30, 2016  : 

Total Leverage Ratio.    On a rolling twelve-month basis, the total leverage ratio, defined as total consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA, shall not exceed   3.75   to 1.00 (for the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company's total leverage ratio was   2.36   to 1.00). 

Senior Secured Leverage Ratio.    On a rolling twelve-month basis, the senior secured leverage ratio, defined as senior secured debt to consolidated EBITDA, shall not exceed   3.50   to 1.00 (for the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company's senior secured leverage ratio was   1.88   to 1.00). 

Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio.    On a rolling twelve-month basis, the minimum interest coverage ratio, defined as consolidated EBITDA to consolidated cash interest expense, shall not be less than   3.50   to 1.00 (for the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company's minimum interest coverage ratio was   6.61   to 1.00). 
       
  The indenture underlying the   Senior Unsecured Notes   contains various covenants, including, but not limited to, covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, limit the Company's and its restricted subsidiaries' ability to incur and/or guarantee additional debt; pay dividends, repurchase stock or make certain other restricted payments; enter into agreements limiting dividends and certain other restricted payments; prepay, redeem or repurchase subordinated debt; grant liens on assets; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; merge, consolidate, transfer or dispose of substantially all of the Company's consolidated assets; sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of property and assets; and engage in transactions with affiliates.

  (In millions, except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated) 

In addition to those covenants, the Company's   $1.6 billion   senior secured credit facility (the "  Senior Secured Credit Facility  ") also includes certain limitations on acquisitions, indebtedness, liens, dividends and repurchases of capital stock, including the following: 

If the Company's total leverage ratio is greater than   3.00   to 1.00 (as defined in the   Senior Secured Credit Facility  ), the Company is prohibited from making greater than   $120.0 million   of annual dividend payments, capital stock repurchases and certain other payments.  If the total leverage ratio is less than   3.00   to 1.00, there are no such restrictions. 

If the Company's senior secured leverage ratio is greater than   3.00   to 1.00 or the Company's total leverage ratio is greater than   3.50   to 1.00 (these ratios as defined in the   Senior Secured Credit Facility  ), the Company is prohibited from voluntarily prepaying any of the   Senior Unsecured Notes   and from voluntarily prepaying any other unsecured or subordinated indebtedness, with certain exceptions (including any mandatory prepayments on the   Senior Unsecured Notes   or any other unsecured or subordinated debt).  If the senior secured leverage ratio is less than   3.00   to 1.00 and the total leverage ratio is less than   3.50   to 1.00, there are no such restrictions. 

Note 11  .    Income Taxes 
    
  The Company records income tax expense on an interim basis.  The estimated annual effective income tax rate is adjusted quarterly, and items discrete to a specific quarter are reflected in tax expense for that interim period.  The effective income tax rate for the interim period can differ from the statutory tax rate, as it reflects changes in valuation allowances due to expected current year earnings or loss and other discrete items, such as changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to establishment and settlement of income tax exposures. 
    
  The Company recorded   $775.0 million   and   $798.3 million   of non-cash goodwill impairment charges during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively, of which   $716.4 million   and   $739.7 million  , respectively, was nondeductible for income tax purposes.  The total tax benefit during the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , related to the goodwill impairment was   $242.4 million  , composed of the following: (1) a   $22.0 million   tax benefit on the   $58.6 million   of deductible goodwill; and (2) a   $220.4 million   deferred tax benefit associated with the reduction of a deferred tax liability related to the investments in United States subsidiaries due to the effects of the goodwill impairment in the United States Print and Related Services segment.  The deferred tax liability related to the investments in United States subsidiaries was originally established when the former   World Color Press   entities emerged from bankruptcy in 2009. 
    
  The Company's liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of   September 30, 2016  , was   $30.0 million  .  The Company anticipates a   $1.1 million   decrease to its liability for unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months due to resolution of income tax audits or statute expirations.

Note 12  .    Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements 
    
  Certain assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, while other assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, generally as a result of acquisitions or impairment charges.  Fair value is determined based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.  GAAP also classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy: 
    
           Level 1: 
    Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
       
           Level 2: 
    Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability. 
       
           Level 3: 
    Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.  There were no Level 3 recurring measurements of assets or liabilities as of   September 30, 2016  . 
       
  The Company records the fair value of its forward contracts and pension plan assets on a recurring basis.  The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, inventories, restricted cash, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and amounts owing in satisfaction of bankruptcy claims approximate their carrying values as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  .  See   Note 10  , "  Debt  ," for further discussion on the fair value of the Company's debt. 
    
  In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company is required to record certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, generally as a result of acquisitions or the remeasurement of assets resulting in impairment charges.  See   Note 2  , "  Acquisitions and Strategic Investments  ," for further discussion on acquisitions.  See   Note 3  , "  Restructuring, Impairment and Transaction-Related Charges  ," and   Note 4  , "  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  ," for further discussion on impairment charges recorded as a result of the remeasurement of certain long-lived assets. 
    
  The Company has operations in countries that have transactions outside their functional currencies and periodically enters into foreign exchange contracts.  These contracts are used to hedge the net exposures of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges.  Gains or losses on net foreign currency hedges are intended to offset losses or gains on the underlying net exposures in an effort to reduce the earnings volatility resulting from fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates.  There were   no   open foreign currency exchange contracts as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The Company periodically enters into natural gas forward purchase contracts to hedge against increases in commodity costs.  The Company's commodity contracts qualified for the exception related to normal purchases and sales during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , as the Company takes delivery in the normal course of business.

Note 13  .    Other Long-Term Liabilities 
    
  The components of other long-term liabilities as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , were as follows: 

Note 14  .    Employee Retirement Plans 
    
  Pension Plans 
    
  The Company sponsors various funded and unfunded pension plans for a portion of its full-time employees in the United States.  Benefits are generally based upon years of service and compensation.  These plans are funded in conformity with the applicable government regulations.  The Company funds at least the minimum amount required for all qualified plans using actuarial cost methods and assumptions acceptable under government regulations. 
    
  The components of net pension income (expense) for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , were as follows: 

On April 1, 2016, the Company provided the option to receive a lump-sum pension payment to a select group of terminated vested participants.  Total lump sum payments of   $71.3 million   have been paid during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , of which   $56.4 million   was paid in July 2016 under the lump-sum program.   During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company settled   $90.1 million   of pension liabilities for   $71.3 million  .  Payments to eligible participants who elected to receive a lump-sum pension payment were funded from existing pension plan assets and constituted a settlement of the Company s pension liabilities with respect to these participants.   
    
  The Company s pension assets and liabilities were remeasured as of July 2016.  The discount rates and actuarial assumptions used to calculate the payouts were determined in accordance with federal regulations.  The Company recorded a non-cash settlement charge of   $6.5 million   during the third quarter of 2016 in connection with the lump sum payments.  The settlement charge was classified as restructuring, impairment and transaction-related charges in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.  These charges resulted from the recognition in earnings of a portion of the actuarial losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss based on the proportion of the obligation settled.

  FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 
  (In millions, except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated) 

For 2015, the Company measured interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations.  Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, the Company changed the approach used to measure interest costs for pension benefits and elected to measure interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows.  The new method would also impact the calculation of service costs, but this is not applicable to the Company's pension plans due to their frozen status.  The Company made this change to provide a more precise measurement of interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans' liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve.  This change did not affect the measurement of the plan obligations.  The Company has reflected this as a change in accounting estimate, and accordingly, has accounted for it on a prospective basis. 
    
  The Company made the following contributions and benefit payments to its defined benefit pension plans during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  : 

Multiemployer Pension Plans ("MEPPs") 
    
  The Company has withdrawn from all significant MEPPs and replaced these union sponsored "promise to pay in the future" defined benefit plans with a Company sponsored "pay as you go" defined contribution plan.  The   two   MEPPs, the Graphic Communications International Union   Employer Retirement Fund ("GCIU") and the Graphic Communications Conference of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters National Pension Fund ("GCC"), are significantly underfunded, and will require the Company to pay a withdrawal liability to fund its pro rata share of the underfunding as of the plan year the full withdrawal was completed.  As a result of the decision to withdraw, the Company accrued a   $98.6 million   estimated withdrawal liability based on information provided by each plan's trustee, as part of the purchase price allocation for   World Color Press  . 
    
  The Company has received notices of withdrawal and demand for payment letters for both the GCIU and GCC plans, which, in total are in excess of the   $98.6 million   in original reserves established by the Company for the withdrawals.  The Company made monthly payments totaling   $8.5 million   and   $9.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, although such payments do not waive the Company's rights to object to the withdrawal liabilities submitted by the GCIU and GCC plan administrators.  The Company is currently in litigation with the MEPPs' trustees to determine the amount and duration of the withdrawal payments.  Arbitration proceedings with the GCIU and GCC have been completed, both sides have appealed the arbitrator's ruling, and litigation in Federal court has commenced.  A Federal court ruling was issued in favor of the GCC during the third quarter of 2016, and the Company has the right to appeal the Federal court ruling.  
    
  The Company has reserved   $50.3 million   as its estimate of the total MEPPs withdrawal liability as of   September 30, 2016  , of which   $34.2 million   was recorded in other long-term liabilities (including   $11.2 million   recorded in long-term restructuring reserve),   $10.6 million   was recorded in accrued liabilities and   $5.5 million   was recorded in unsecured notes to be issued in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  The withdrawal liability reserved by the Company is within the range of the Company's estimated potential outcomes.  This estimate may increase or decrease depending on the final conclusion of the litigation with the MEPPs' trustees.

Note 15  .    Earnings (Loss) Per Share 
    
  Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed as net earnings (loss) divided by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding of   47.8 million   and   47.6 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   48.0 million   and   47.9 million   shares for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.  The calculation of diluted earnings per share includes the effect of any dilutive equity incentive instruments.  The Company uses the treasury stock method to calculate the effect of outstanding dilutive equity incentive instruments, which requires the Company to compute total proceeds as the sum of the following: (1) the amount the employee must pay upon exercise of the award; (2) the amount of unearned stock-based compensation costs attributable to future services; and (3) for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the amount of excess tax benefits, if any, that would be credited to additional paid-in capital, assuming exercise of the award.  The calculation of total proceeds for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , excludes the excess tax benefits as a result of the early prospective adoption of new accounting guidance related to share-based compensation during the second quarter of 2016, with retrospective application to January 1, 2016.  See   Note 21  , "  New Accounting Pronouncements  ," for further discussion of the adoption of the new accounting standard related to share-based compensation and its impacts to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Equity incentive instruments for which the total employee proceeds from exercise exceed the average fair value of the same equity incentive instrument over the period have an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per share during periods with net earnings, and accordingly, the Company excludes them from the calculation.  Anti-dilutive equity instruments of   0.7 million   and   2.3 million   class A common shares were excluded from the computation of diluted net earnings per share for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively.  Due to the net loss incurred during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the assumed exercise of all equity incentive instruments was anti-dilutive and, therefore, not included in the diluted loss per share calculation for those periods. 
    
  Reconciliations of the numerator and the denominator of the basic and diluted per share computations for the Company's common stock, for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , are summarized as follows:

Note 16  .    Equity Incentive Programs 
    
  The shareholders of the Company approved the Quad/Graphics, Inc. 2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan ("Omnibus Plan") for two complementary purposes: (1) to attract and retain outstanding individuals to serve as directors, officers and employees; and (2) to increase shareholder value.  In May 2016, an additional   3,000,000   shares were approved for issuance, providing for an aggregate   10,871,652   shares of class A common stock reserved for issuance under the Omnibus Plan.  Awards under the Omnibus Plan may consist of incentive awards, stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, performance share units, shares of class A common stock, restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred stock units or other stock-based awards as determined by the Company's Board of Directors.  Each stock option granted has an exercise price of no less than   100%   of the fair market value of the class A common stock on the date of grant.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   2,848,196   shares available for issuance under the Omnibus Plan. 
    
  The Company recognizes compensation expense based on estimated grant date fair values for all share-based awards issued to employees and non-employee directors, including stock options, performance shares, performance share units, restricted stock, restricted stock units and deferred stock units.  The Company recognizes these compensation costs for only those awards expected to vest, on a straight-line basis over the requisite   three   to   four   year service period of the awards, except deferred stock units, which are fully vested and expensed on the grant date.  The Company estimated the number of awards expected to vest based, in part, on historical forfeiture rates and also based on management's expectations of employee turnover within the specific employee groups receiving each type of award.  Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. 
    
  Equity Incentive Compensation Expense 
    
  The total compensation expense (income) recognized related to all equity incentive programs was expense of   $3.8 million   and   $12.0 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and income of   $1.9 million   and expense of   $4.0 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively, and was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.  Total future compensation expense related to all equity incentive programs granted as of   September 30, 2016  , was estimated to be   $17.3 million  .  Estimated future compensation expense is   $3.3 million   for   2016  ,   $8.9 million   for   2017  ,   $4.5 million   for   2018   and   $0.6 million   for   2019  . 
    
  Net tax benefit (expense) on equity award activity was an expense of   $0.3 million   and a benefit of   $1.8 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  With the prospective adoption of the new accounting standard on share-based compensation, net tax benefit (expense) on equity award activity is included in net earnings (loss) in the operating activities section of the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . See   Note 21  , "  New Accounting Pronouncements  ," for further discussion of the adoption of the new accounting standard related to share-based compensation and its impacts to the condensed consolidated financial statements.  Net tax benefit (expense) on equity award activity is shown as tax benefit on equity award activity in the financing activities section of the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Stock Options 
    
  Options vest over   four years  , with   no   vesting in the first year and   one-third   vesting upon the second, third and fourth anniversary dates.  As defined in the individual grant agreements, acceleration of vesting may occur under a change in control, death, disability or normal retirement of the grantee.  Options expire no later than the   tenth   anniversary of the grant date,   24   months after termination for death,   36   months after termination for normal retirement or disability and   90   days after termination of employment for any other reason.  Options are not credited with dividend declarations, except for the November 18, 2011 grants.  Stock options are only to be granted to employees.

Performance Share and Performance Share Units 
    
  Performance share ("PS") and performance share unit ("PSU") awards consist of shares or the rights to shares of the Company's class A common stock which are awarded to employees of the Company.  There were   no   PS or PSU awards granted during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  Shares awarded in 2013 had a performance period of   three years   that ended December 31, 2015.  The Company did not achieve the established performance targets for the performance period ended December 31, 2015; therefore, the PS and PSU awards were canceled. 
    
  Compensation expense for awards granted was recognized based on a best estimate of the anticipated payout, net of estimated forfeitures.  There was   no   compensation expense recognized related to PS and PSUs for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  Compensation expense (income) recognized related to PS and PSUs was income of   $4.8 million   and   $4.6 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.  There is   no   future compensation expense for PS and PSUs as of   September 30, 2016  .

Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units 
    
  Restricted stock ("RS") and restricted stock unit ("RSU") awards consist of shares or the rights to shares of the Company's class A common stock which are awarded to employees of the Company.  The awards are restricted such that they are subject to substantial risk of forfeiture and to restrictions on their sale or other transfer by the employee.  RSU awards are typically granted to eligible employees outside of the United States.  As defined in the individual grant agreements, acceleration of vesting may occur under a change in control, death, disability or normal retirement of the grantee.  Grantees receiving RS grants are able to exercise full voting rights and receive full credit for dividends during the vesting period.  All such dividends will be paid to the RS grantee within   45   days of full vesting.  Grantees receiving RSUs are not entitled to vote, but do earn dividends.  Upon vesting, RSUs will be settled either through cash payment equal to the fair market value of the RSUs on the vesting date or through issuance of the Company's class A common stock. 
    
  The following table is a summary of RS and RSU award activity for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  : 

During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , RS awards of   3,979   shares and RSU awards of   7,728   units were granted at a weighted average grant date fair value of   $27.09  .  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , RS awards of   1,315,571   shares and RSU awards of   175,228   units were granted at weighted-average grant date fair values of   $9.44   and   $10.08  , respectively.  During the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , RS awards of   14,921   shares were granted at a weighted average grant date fair value of   $13.84  .  There were   no   RSU awards granted during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  .  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , RSA awards of   603,377   shares and RSU awards of   70,445   units were granted at weighted-average grant date fair values of   $22.87   and   $23.11  , respectively.

Deferred Stock Units 
    
  Deferred stock units ("DSU") are awards of rights to shares of the Company's class A common stock and are awarded to non-employee directors of the Company.  The following table is a summary of DSU award activity for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  : 

There were   no   DSU awards granted during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  .  DSU awards of   78,750   units were granted at a weighted-average grant date fair value of   $9.30   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  There were   no   DSU awards granted during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  .  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , DSU awards of   34,139   units were granted at a weighted-average grant date fair value of   $23.11  .  Each DSU award entitles the grantee to receive   one   share of class A common stock upon the earlier of the separation date of the grantee or the second anniversary of the grant date, but could be subject to acceleration for a change in control, death or disability as defined in the individual DSU grant agreement.  Grantees of DSU awards may not exercise voting rights, but are credited with dividend equivalents, and those dividend equivalents will be converted into additional DSU awards based on the closing price of the class A common stock.  Dividend equivalents granted were   3,209   and   11,383   units during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   3,239   and   6,969   units during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  There was   no   compensation expense recorded for DSUs during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   $0.8 million   of compensation expense was recorded for DSUs during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  There was   no   compensation expense recorded for DSUs during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , and   $0.8 million   of compensation expense was recorded for DSUs during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  As DSU awards are fully vested on the grant date, all compensation expense was recognized at the date of grant.

Note 21  .    New Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("  FASB  ") issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-16 "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfer of Assets Other Than Inventory" ("ASU 2016-16"), which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs rather than waiting until the asset is sold to an outside party.  Assets covered under the scope of ASU 2016-16 include intellectual property and property, plant and equipment.  The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of an annual reporting period.  This new guidance will require a modified retrospective transition approach, where the entity will need to apply a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings (accumulated deficit) as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted.  The Company does not believe the adoption of ASU 2016-16 will have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the   FASB   issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-15 "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments" ("ASU 2016-15"), which is intended to reduce diversity in practice, providing guidance on eight specific cash flow classification issues with regards to how the cash receipts and cash payments are presented within the statements of cash flows.  The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.  This new guidance will require a retrospective adoption approach unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case the guidance should be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable.  The Company does not believe the adoption of ASU 2016-15 will have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In June 2016, the   FASB   issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13 "Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments" ("ASU 2016-13"), which changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments.  Under the new guidance, entities will be required to measure expected credit losses for financial instruments, including trade receivables, based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable forecasts.  This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  This new guidance will require a modified retrospective transition approach, where the entity will need to apply a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings (accumulated deficit) as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted.  The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the   FASB   issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 "Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting" ("ASU 2016-09"), which simplifies the accounting for share-based payments, including income tax consequences, accounting for forfeitures, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statements of cash flows.  This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company elected to early adopt ASU 2016-09, with retrospective application to January 1, 2016.  Prior to the adoption of the ASU, excess tax benefits or expense related to stock-based compensation transactions were recognized in additional paid-in capital on the condensed consolidated balance sheets; following the adoption of the ASU, all excess tax benefits or expense related to stock-based compensation transactions are recognized prospectively as income tax expense (benefit) in the condensed consolidated statements of operations, and the excess tax benefits or expense from the stock-based compensation transactions previously included in financing activities on the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows are prospectively included as a component of net loss on the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.  See   Note 15  , "  Earnings (Loss) Per Share  ," for the impacts of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on the calculation of the effect of outstanding dilutive equity incentive instruments using the treasury stock method.  See   Note 16  , "  Equity Incentive Programs  ," for the Company's policy election on accounting for forfeitures.  The adoption of ASU 2016-09 did not have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements.

  (In millions, except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated) 

In March 2016, the   FASB   issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-07 "Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting" ("ASU 2016-07"), which simplifies the equity method of accounting by eliminating the requirement to retrospectively apply equity method accounting to an investment that subsequently qualifies for such accounting as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence.  Instead, the equity method of accounting will be applied prospectively as an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence occurs.  This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.  The Company does not believe the adoption of ASU 2016-07 will have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the   FASB   issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02 "Leases (Topic 842)" ("ASU 2016-02"), which establishes a right-of-use model requiring a lessee to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than twelve months.  Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition.  The guidance also requires additional disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.  This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.  This new guidance will require a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to elect to use certain transition relief.  The modified retrospective transition approach would require the application of the new accounting model for the earliest year presented in the financial statements.  The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In May 2014, the   FASB   issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)" ("ASU 2014-09"), which provides revised guidance on recognizing revenue from contracts with customers.  Under this guidance, an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to the customer in the amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services.  This guidance also requires more detailed disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of the revenue and cash flow arising from contracts with customers.  This guidance allows the option of either a full retrospective adoption, meaning the guidance is applied to all periods presented, or a modified retrospective adoption, meaning the guidance is applied only to the most current period.  As amended, ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company plans to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2018.  The Company is evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on the condensed consolidated financial statements and currently anticipates applying the modified retrospective approach when adopting this guidance.

  Quad/Graphics operates primarily in the commercial print portion of the printing industry, with related product and service offerings designed to offer clients complete solutions for communicating their message to target audiences.  The Company's operating and reportable segments are aligned with how the chief operating decision maker of the Company manages the business.  The Company's reportable and operating segments are summarized below. 
    
  The United States Print and Related Services segment is predominantly comprised of the Company's United States printing operations and is managed as one integrated platform.

Key Performance Metrics Overview 
    
  The Company's management believes the ability to generate net sales growth, profit increases and positive cash flow, while maintaining the appropriate level of debt, are key indicators of the successful execution of the Company's business strategy and will increase shareholder value.  The Company uses period over period net sales growth, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, net cash provided by operating activities, Free Cash Flow and Debt Leverage Ratio as metrics to measure operating performance, financial condition and liquidity.  EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Free Cash Flow and Debt Leverage Ratio are non-GAAP financial measures (see the definitions of EBITDA, EBITDA margin and the reconciliation of net earnings (loss) to EBITDA in the "Results of Operations" section below, and see the definitions of Free Cash Flow and Debt Leverage Ratio, the reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow, and the calculation of Debt Leverage Ratio in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section below). 
    
  Net sales growth.    The Company uses period over period net sales growth as a key performance metric.  The Company's management assesses net sales growth based on the ability to generate increased net sales through increased sales to existing clients, sales to new clients, sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new clients and opportunities to expand sales through strategic investments, including acquisitions. 
    
  EBITDA and EBITDA margin.    The Company uses EBITDA and EBITDA margin as metrics to assess operating performance.  The Company's management assesses EBITDA and EBITDA margin based on the ability to increase revenues while controlling variable expense growth. 
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities.    The Company uses net cash provided by operating activities as a metric to assess liquidity.  The Company's management assesses net cash provided by operating activities based on the ability to meet recurring cash obligations while increasing available cash to fund integration and restructuring requirements, including acquired operations and other cost reduction activities, as well as to fund capital expenditures, debt service requirements,   World Color Press   single employer pension plan contributions,   World Color Press   MEPPs withdrawal liabilities, acquisitions and other investments in future growth, shareholder dividends and share repurchases.  Net cash provided by operating activities can be significantly impacted by the timing of non-recurring or infrequent receipts or expenditures. 
    
  Free Cash Flow.    The Company uses Free Cash Flow as a metric to assess liquidity and capital deployment.  The Company's management assesses Free Cash Flow as a measure to quantify cash available for strengthening the balance sheet (debt reduction), for strategic capital allocation and deployment through investments in the business (acquisitions and strategic investments), and for returning capital to the shareholders (dividends and share repurchases).  The priorities for capital allocation and deployment will change as circumstances dictate for the business, and Free Cash Flow can be significantly impacted by the Company's restructuring activities and other unusual items. 
    
  Debt Leverage Ratio.    The Company uses the Debt Leverage Ratio as a metric to assess liquidity and the flexibility of its balance sheet.  Consistent with other liquidity metrics, the Company monitors the Debt Leverage Ratio as a measure to determine the appropriate level of debt the Company believes is optimal to operate its business, and accordingly, to quantify debt capacity available for strategic capital allocation and deployment through investments in the business (capital expenditures and acquisitions), for strengthening the balance sheet (debt and pension liability reduction), and for returning capital to the shareholders (dividends and share repurchases).  The priorities for capital allocation and deployment will change as circumstances dictate for the business, and the Debt Leverage Ratio can be significantly impacted by the amount and timing of large expenditures requiring debt financing, as well as changes in profitability.

Overview of Trends Affecting Quad/Graphics 
    
  Competition in the highly fragmented printing industry remains intense, and the Company believes that there are indicators of heightened competitive pressures.  The industry has excess manufacturing capacity created by continued declines in industry volume which, in turn, has created accelerated downward pricing pressures.  In addition, digital delivery of documents and data, including the online distribution and hosting of media content and mobile technologies, offer alternatives to traditional delivery of printed documents.  Increasing consumer acceptance of digital delivery of content has resulted in marketers and publishers allocating their marketing and advertising spend across the expanding selection of digital delivery options, which further reduces printing demand and contributes to industry overcapacity.  The Company also faces competition from print management firms, which look to streamline processes and reduce the overall print spend of the Company's clients, as well as from strategic marketing firms focused on helping businesses integrate multiple channels into their marketing campaigns. 
    
  The Company believes that a disciplined approach for capital management and a strong balance sheet are critical to be able to invest in profitable growth opportunities and technological advances, thereby providing the highest return for shareholders.  Management balances the use of cash between compelling investment opportunities, deleveraging the Company's balance sheet (through reduction in debt and pension obligations), and returns to shareholders (through share repurchases and a quarterly dividend of   $0.30   per share). 
    
  The Company continues to remain disciplined with its debt leverage.  The Company's consolidated debt and capital leases   decreased   by   $177 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , primarily due to a sustainable decrease in working capital levels and an increase in cash from earnings.  The Company redeemed   $60 million   of its senior notes under the Master Note and Security Agreement and repurchased   $57 million   of its   Senior Unsecured Notes   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , for a total net gain of   $14 million   that was recognized in gain on debt extinguishment in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.  These repurchases were primarily completed to efficiently reduce debt balances and the Debt Leverage Ratio, as well as interest expense based on current LIBOR rates.  Since the Company completed the   World Color Press   acquisition in   July 2010  , the Company has reduced debt and capital leases by   $567 million   and has reduced the obligations for pension, postretirement and MEPPs by   $365 million  . 
    
  The Company has been working diligently to integrate acquired companies, thereby lowering its cost structure by consolidating its manufacturing platform into its most efficient facilities, as well as realizing purchasing, mailing and logistics efficiencies by centralizing and consolidating print manufacturing volume and eliminating redundancies in its administrative and corporate operations.  These efforts include the deployment of the Company's Smartools  platform to streamline workflows and improve data visibility across the consolidated platform.  In addition, restructuring actions initiated by the Company beginning in 2010 have resulted in the announcement of   33   plant closures and have reduced headcount by approximately   11,000   employees through   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  In addition to cost savings through acquisition-related synergies, the Company continues its focus on cost reductions through Lean Manufacturing and Continuous Improvement initiatives, both on the production floor and with administrative support, in order to achieve improved efficiencies, reduce waste, lower overall operating costs, enhance quality and timeliness and create a safer work environment for the Company's employees.  In January 2016, the Company announced that it had completed its previously announced $100 million sustainable cost reduction program ahead of schedule, intended to bring the Company's cost structure in line with revenues in light of heightened competitive pressures.  The program included reducing excess manufacturing capacity through plant closures; intensifying the Company's focus on productivity; reducing selling, general and administrative costs; and implementing a new streamlined organizational structure.  The cost reduction program incrementally reduced the Company's cost structure by $100 million starting January 1, 2016, and the Company intends to continue reducing costs during 2016 and in the years beyond. 
    
  Integrated distribution with the postal service is an important component of the Company's business.  Any material change in the current service levels provided by the postal service could impact the demand that clients have for print services.      The United States Postal Service ("USPS") continues to experience financial problems and a negative balance sheet.  Without increased revenues or action by Congress to reform the USPS cost structure, these losses will continue into the future.  As a result of these financial difficulties, the USPS has come under increased pressure to adjust its postal rates and service levels.  In January 2014, the USPS implemented a temporary exigent postage rate increase of 4.3%.  The 4.3% temporary exigent increase expired on April 10, 2016, resulting in an overall reduction in postal prices.  The USPS has filed an appeal in federal court requesting that the "surcharge" be reinstated and made part of the permanent base postage rate.  The appeal is still pending.

Quad/Graphics has invested significantly in its mail preparation and distribution capabilities to mitigate the impact of increases in postage costs, and to help clients successfully navigate the ever-changing postal environment.  Through its data analytics, unique software to merge mailstreams on a large scale, advanced finishing capabilities and technology, and in-house transportation and logistics operations, the Company manages the mail preparation and distribution of most of its clients' products to maximize efficiency, to enable on-time and consistent delivery and to partially reduce these costs; however, the net impact of increasing postal costs may create a decrease in client demand for print and mail products. 
    
  When making capital investment decisions, management undertakes a thorough process aimed at driving the strongest contribution to long-term profitability, whether those are property, plant and equipment additions; organic growth opportunities; or acquisitions.  Some recent examples of capital investments made by the Company include the following: 

The Company completed the acquisition of Specialty on   August 25, 2015  , for a net purchase price of   $61 million  , excluding acquired cash.  Specialty is a full-service paperboard folding carton manufacturer and logistics provider located in Omaha, Nebraska. 

The Company completed the acquisition of Copac on   April 14, 2015  , for a net purchase price of   $59 million  , excluding acquired cash.  Copac is a leading international provider of innovative packaging and supply chain solutions, including turnkey packaging design, production and fulfillment services across a range of end markets, headquartered in Spartanburg, South Carolina.  Copac manufactures products such as folding cartons, labels, inserts, tags and specialty envelopes, and has production facilities in Spartanburg and Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, as well as strategically sourcing packaging product manufacturing over multiple end markets in Central America and Asia, giving it a global footprint. 

The Company completed the acquisition of Marin's on   February 3, 2015  , for a net purchase price of   $21 million  , excluding acquired cash.  Marin's is a worldwide leader in the point-of-sale display industry and specializes in the research and design of display solutions, headquartered in Paris, France.  Marin's products are produced by a global network of licensees, including Quad/Graphics, as well as one wide-format digital print, kitting and fulfillment facility in Paris.  Marin's uses its own European-based sales force and the global licensees to sell its patented product portfolio. 
       
  The Company is subject to seasonality in its quarterly results as net sales and operating income are higher in the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year as compared to the first and second quarters.  The fourth quarter is the highest seasonal quarter for cash flows from operating activities and Free Cash Flow due to the reduction of working capital requirements that reach peak levels during the third quarter.  Seasonality is driven by increased magazine advertising page counts, retail inserts, catalogs and books primarily due to back-to-school and holiday-related advertising and promotions.  The Company expects this seasonality impact to continue in future years.

  Goodwill Impairment 
    
  Due to the decline in the Company's stock price in the third quarter of 2015, an interim goodwill impairment test of the three reporting units in the United States Print and Related Services segment was performed as of   July 31, 2015  .  These reporting units include the Core Print and Related Services reporting unit, the Specialty Print and Related Services reporting unit and the Other United States Products and Services reporting unit with goodwill of   $640.8 million  ,   $115.6 million   and   $18.6 million  , respectively, as of   July 31, 2015  .  After completing a step one evaluation, the estimated fair value of each of the three reporting units in the United States Print and Related Services segment was determined to be lower than the carrying value of each

respective reporting unit.  As a result of the interim goodwill assessment, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash goodwill impairment charge of   $775.0 million   (  $532.6 million   after tax) as of September 30, 2015. 

EBITDA and EBITDA Margin Consolidated 
    
  EBITDA and EBITDA margin for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , were as follows: 

EBITDA   increased     $789.3 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to the following: (1) a $775.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2015 that did not repeat in 2016; (2)   $9.5 million   of   decreased   restructuring, impairment and transaction-related charges; and (3) lower costs primarily associated with production cost reduction initiatives.  These impacts were partially offset by the following: (1) lower print volume and pricing in product lines owned more than a year; and (2) a $3.8 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to increased incentive compensation expense. 
    
  EBITDA represents net earnings (loss) plus (1) interest expense, (2) income tax expense (if applicable) and (3) depreciation and amortization, and less income tax benefit (if applicable).  EBITDA margin represents EBITDA as a percentage of net sales.  EBITDA and EBITDA margin are presented to provide additional information regarding Quad/Graphics' performance.  Both are important measures by which Quad/Graphics gauges the profitability and assesses the performance of its business.  EBITDA and EBITDA margin are not measures of financial performance in accordance with GAAP.  EBITDA and EBITDA margin should not be considered alternatives to net earnings (loss) as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity.  Quad/Graphics' calculation of EBITDA and EBITDA margin may be different from the calculations used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.  A reconciliation of EBITDA to net earnings (loss) for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , was as follows:

(8)   
    Operating income, excluding restructuring, impairment and transaction-related charges and non-cash goodwill impairment charges, increased   $53.9 million   (  $32.2 million  , net of tax) during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , primarily due to the following: (1) lower costs primarily associated with increased labor productivity and other production cost reduction initiatives; (2) a $28.3 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense; (3) the 2016 collection of a $10.4 million vendor receivable that was written-off in the fourth quarter of 2015 due to collectability concerns; and (4) the additional earnings on sales generated from acquisitions.  These impacts were partially offset by the following: (1) lower print volume and pricing in product lines owned more than a year; (2) a $15.7 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to increased incentive compensation expense; and (3) a $4.0 million vacation expense reduction in 2015 due to a vacation policy change that did not repeat in 2016. 

Operating Results 
    
  The following table sets forth certain information from the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations on an absolute dollar basis and as a relative percentage of total net sales for each noted period, together with the relative percentage change in such information between the periods set forth below:

These reductions were partially offset by the following: (1) increased cost of product sales resulting from acquisitions; and (2) a $4.0 million vacation expense reduction in 2015 due to a vacation policy change that did not repeat in 2016. 
    
  Cost of product sales as a percentage of total net sales decreased to   68.5%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   70.2%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to the reasons provided above.

These increases were partially offset by a $22.9 million decrease in employee-related costs and a $1.9 million decrease in general administrative expenses primarily due to the Company's cost reduction initiatives.  Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased from   9.9%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   to   10.9%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , primarily due to the reasons stated above.

  Goodwill Impairment 
    
  Due to the decline in the Company's stock price in the third quarter of 2015, an interim goodwill impairment test of the three reporting units in the United States Print and Related Services segment was performed as of July 31, 2015.  These reporting units include the Core Print and Related Services reporting unit, the Specialty Print and Related Services reporting unit and the Other United States Products and Services reporting unit with goodwill of $640.8 million, $115.6 million and $18.6 million, respectively, as of July 31, 2015.  After completing a step one evaluation, the estimated fair value of each of the three reporting units in the United States Print and Related Services segment was determined to be lower than the carrying value of each respective reporting unit.  As a result of the interim goodwill assessment, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $775.0 million ($532.6 million after tax) as of September 30, 2015. 
    
  On March 25, 2015, due to deteriorating economic conditions, including inflation and currency devaluation, combined with uncertain political conditions, declining print volumes and labor challenges, the Company's   Argentina Subsidiaries   (included within the Latin America reporting unit) commenced bankruptcy restructuring proceedings with a goal of consolidating operations.  As a result, the Company conducted an interim goodwill impairment assessment of the Latin America reporting unit, which included comparing the carrying amount of net assets, including goodwill, to its respective fair value as of March 31, 2015, the date of the interim assessment.  The interim impairment test indicated the goodwill of the Latin America reporting unit was impaired and a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $23.3 million was recorded in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .

EBITDA and EBITDA Margin Consolidated 
    
  EBITDA and EBITDA margin for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , were as follows: 

EBITDA   increased     $859.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to the following: (1) a   $798.3 million   non-cash goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2015 that did not repeat in 2016; (2) lower costs primarily associated with increased labor productivity and other production cost reduction initiatives; (3)   $17.6 million   of   decreased   restructuring, impairment and transaction-related charges; (4) the 2016 collection of a $10.4 million vendor receivable that was written-off in the fourth quarter of 2015 due to collectability concerns; and (5) the additional earnings on sales generated from acquisitions.  These impacts were partially offset by the following: (1) lower print volume and pricing in product lines owned more than a year; (2) a $15.7 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation expense; and (3) a $4.0 million vacation expense reduction in 2015 due to a vacation policy change that did not repeat in 2016. 
    
  EBITDA represents net earnings (loss) plus (1) interest expense, (2) income tax expense (if applicable) and (3) depreciation and amortization, and less income tax benefit (if applicable).  EBITDA margin represents EBITDA as a percentage of net sales.  EBITDA and EBITDA margin are presented to provide additional information regarding Quad/Graphics' performance.  Both are important measures by which Quad/Graphics gauges the profitability and assesses the performance of its business.  EBITDA and EBITDA margin are not measures of financial performance in accordance with GAAP.  EBITDA and EBITDA margin should not be considered alternatives to net earnings (loss) as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity.  Quad/Graphics' calculation of EBITDA and EBITDA margin may be different from the calculations used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.  A reconciliation of EBITDA to net earnings (loss) for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , was as follows:

  Operating income (loss) for the United States Print and Related Services segment   increased     $827.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to the following: (1) a $775.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2015 that did not repeat in 2016; (2) lower costs primarily associated with increased labor productivity and other production cost reduction initiatives; (3) the 2016 collection of a $10.4 million vendor receivable that was written-off in the fourth quarter of 2015 due to collectability concerns; and (4) the additional earnings on sales generated from acquisitions.  These impacts were partially offset by the following: (1) lower print volume and pricing in product lines owned more than a year; (2)   $8.9 million   in   increased   restructuring, impairment and transaction-related charges; and (3) a $4.0 million vacation expense reduction in 2015 due to a vacation policy change that did not repeat in 2016. 
    
  Operating margin for the United States Print and Related Services segment increased to   4.0%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to negative   23.7%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to the reasons provided above.

  Goodwill Impairment 
    
  Due to the decline in the Company's stock price in the third quarter of 2015, an interim goodwill impairment test of the three reporting units in the United States Print and Related Services segment was performed as of July 31, 2015.  These reporting units include the Core Print and Related Services reporting unit, the Specialty Print and Related Services reporting unit and the Other United States Products and Services reporting unit with goodwill of $640.8 million, $115.6 million and $18.6 million, respectively, as of July 31, 2015.  After completing a step one evaluation, the estimated fair value of each of the three reporting units in the United States Print and Related Services segment was determined to be lower than the carrying value of each respective reporting unit.  As a result of the interim goodwill assessment, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $775.0 million ($532.6 million after tax) as of September 30, 2015.

Net Sales 
    
  Product sales for the International segment   increased     $15.2 million  , or   5.7%  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to the following: (1) a $25.4 million increase in volume and price primarily in Argentina, Peru, Colombia, Mexico and Europe; (2) a $10.4 million increase in pass-through paper sales; and (3) a $1.3 million increase in sales from the Marin's acquisition.  These increases were partially offset by $21.9 million in negative foreign exchange impacts primarily in Argentina, Mexico, Colombia and Peru. 
    
  Service sales for the International segment   decreased     $0.7 million  , or   4.9%  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to a decrease in logistics revenue in Europe. 
    
  Operating Income (Loss) 
    
  Operating income for the International segment   increased     $73.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the operating loss for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to the following: (1) a   $40.7 million   decrease in restructuring and impairment expenses; (2) a   $23.3 million   non-cash goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2015 that did not repeat in 2016; and (3) a $9.2 million increase in operating income primarily in Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Europe. 
    
  Restructuring, Impairment and Transaction-Related Charges 
    
  Restructuring, impairment and transaction-related charges for the International segment for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , were   $0.7 million  , consisting of the following: (1)   $1.1 million   of employee termination charges related to workforce reductions through facility consolidations and involuntary separation programs; (2) $0.4 million of impairment charges for machinery and equipment no longer being utilized in production as a result of facility consolidations in Queretaro, Mexico; (3)   $0.1 million   of transaction related charges; and (4)   $(0.9) million   of various other restructuring charges (income) to maintain and exit closed facilities, including gains on the sale of the Queretaro, Mexico building and equipment. 
    
  Restructuring, impairment and transaction-related charges for the International segment for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , were   $41.4 million  , consisting of the following: (1)   $6.3 million   of employee termination charges related to workforce reductions through facility consolidations and involuntary separation programs; (2)   $26.2 million   of impairment charges, including   $16.7 million   of impairment charges to reduce the book value of the Company's equity method investment in Chile to fair value (see   Note 7  , "  Equity Method Investments in Unconsolidated Entities  ," to the condensed consolidated financial statements in   Item 1  , "  Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)  ," of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional details related to the impairment of the Company's equity method investment in Chile); $7.3 million of impairment charges primarily for machinery and equipment no longer being utilized in production as a result of facility consolidations, as well as other capacity reduction restructuring initiatives; and   $2.2 million   of impairment charges for property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets as a result of the restructuring proceedings in Argentina for the Company's   Argentina Subsidiaries  ; and (3)   $8.9 million   of other restructuring charges primarily related to the $6.0 million non-cash expense to recognize accumulated foreign exchange losses on the sale of the Chile equity method investment. 
    
  Goodwill Impairment 
    
  On March 25, 2015, due to deteriorating economic conditions, including inflation and currency devaluation, combined with uncertain political conditions, declining print volume and labor challenges, the Company's   Argentina Subsidiaries   (included within the Latin America reporting unit) commenced bankruptcy restructuring proceedings with a goal of consolidating operations.  The Company conducted an interim goodwill impairment assessment of the Latin America reporting unit, which included comparing the carrying amount of net assets, including goodwill, to its respective fair value as of March 31, 2015, the date of the interim assessment.  The interim impairment test indicated the goodwill of the Latin America reporting unit was impaired and a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of   $23.3 million   was recorded in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .

Equity in Loss of Unconsolidated Entities 
    
  Investments in entities where Quad/Graphics has the ability to exert significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.  The Company holds a   49%   ownership interest in Plural, a commercial printer based in S o Paulo, Brazil.  The Company also held a   50%   interest in a joint venture in Chile that was acquired as part of the   World Color Press   acquisition until   July 31, 2015  , when the investment was sold.  The equity in loss of unconsolidated entities in the International segment decreased   $3.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to a $3.0 million decrease in losses from unconsolidated entities at the Company's investment in Plural, the Company's Brazilian joint venture and a $0.8 million decrease in losses at the Company's investment in Chile that was sold on July 31, 2015. 
    
  Unrestricted Subsidiaries 
    
  Unrestricted subsidiaries as defined in the Senior Unsecured Notes indenture represented less than   2.0%   of total consolidated net sales for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 

Corporate 
    
  The following table summarizes unallocated operating expenses presented as Corporate: 

Operating Expenses 
    
  Corporate operating expenses   increased     $30.6 million  , or   97.5%  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to the following: (1) a $14.3 million increase in incentive compensation expenses; (2) a   $14.2 million   increase in restructuring, impairment and transaction-related charges, which included a   $10.0 million   non-recurring gain in 2015 as a result of Courier's termination of the agreement pursuant to which Quad/Graphics was to acquire Courier; and (3) a $6.0 million increase in legal expenses. 
    
  Restructuring, Impairment and Transaction-Related Charges 
    
  Corporate restructuring, impairment and transaction-related charges for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , were   $21.3 million  , consisting of the following: (1)   $0.9 million   of employee termination charges related to workforce reductions through involuntary separation programs; (2)   $1.8 million   of transaction-related charges which primarily included professional service fees; and (3)   $18.6 million   of other restructuring charges, including an $11.2 million adjustment to the Company's MEPPs withdrawal liability and a $6.5 million non-cash pension settlement charge related to lump-sum pension payments. 
    
  Corporate restructuring, impairment and transaction-related charges for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , were   $7.1 million  , consisting of the following: (1)   $4.5 million   of employee termination charges related to workforce reductions through involuntary separation programs; (2)   $8.3 million   of impairment charges for corporate fixed assets; (3)   $(7.3) million   of transaction-related charges (income), which included the   $10.0 million   non-recurring gain from Courier, partially offset by   $2.7 million   of professional service fees, including fees for the terminated acquisition of Courier and the acquisitions of Marin's, Copac and Specialty; (4)   $0.3 million   of acquisition-related integration costs primarily related to professional fees; and (5)   $1.3 million   of other restructuring charges.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  The Company utilizes cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under its credit facilities to satisfy its liquidity and capital requirements.  The Company has   $754.4 million   of unused capacity under the revolving credit arrangement at   September 30, 2016  , which is net of   $49.1 million   of issued letters of credit.  When considering maximum allowable borrowings under its most restrictive financial covenants, available liquidity is reduced to   $705.9 million  .  The Company believes its expected future cash flows from operating activities and   $705.9 million   of available liquidity provide sufficient resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and the integration and restructuring requirements related to acquired operations, as well as future capital expenditures, debt service requirements,   World Color Press   single employer pension plan contributions,   World Color Press   MEPPs withdrawal payments, investments in future growth to create value for its shareholders, shareholder dividends and share repurchases.  Borrowings under the   $850.0 million   revolving credit facility were   $46.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , and peak borrowings were   $80.9 million   and   $127.4 million   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. 

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
    
  Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016  , Compared to   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015 
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $260.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $179.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , resulting in a   $80.8 million     increase   in cash provided by operating activities.  The   increase   was primarily due to a   $50.6 million   increase in cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities, predominantly from a sustainable reduction in working capital levels, and a   $30.2 million     increase   in cash from earnings. 

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
    
  Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016  , Compared to   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015 
    
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $56.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $233.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , resulting in a   $177.6 million     decrease   in cash used in investing activities.  The   decrease   was primarily due to the following: (1) a   $140.8 million   decrease in cash payments related to acquisitions as the Marin's, Copac and Specialty Finishing acquisitions were completed during the first nine months of   2015  , and there were no acquisitions during the first nine months of   2016  ; and (2) a   $53.5 million     decrease   in purchases of property, plant and equipment.  These decreases were partially offset by   $10.5 million   of proceeds received for the sale of the Company's   50%   ownership interest in Chile during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 

Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities 
    
  Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016  , Compared to   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015 
    
  Net cash used in financing activities was   $202.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to net cash provided by financing activities of   $60.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , resulting in a   $263.7 million     decrease   in cash provided by financing activities.  The   decrease   was primarily due to a   $274.2 million   increase in net repayments of debt and lease obligations in   2016   as compared to   2015   and   $8.8 million   of purchases of treasury stock in   2016  , offset by $20.6 million of increased sales of stock for option exercises in 2016. 

Free Cash Flow 
    
  Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. 
    
  The Company's management assesses Free Cash Flow as a measure to quantify cash available for (1) strengthening the balance sheet (debt reduction), (2) strategic capital allocation and deployment through investments in the business (acquisitions and strategic investments) and (3) returning capital to the shareholders (dividends and share repurchases).  The priorities for capital allocation and deployment will change as circumstances dictate for the business, and Free Cash Flow can be significantly impacted by the Company's restructuring activities and other unusual items. 

70 

     Table of Contents  

Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure.  Free Cash Flow should not be considered an alternative to cash flows provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity.  Quad/Graphics' calculation of Free Cash Flow may be different from similar calculations used by other companies, and therefore, comparability may be limited. 
    
  Free Cash Flow for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , was as follows: 

Free Cash Flow   increased     $134.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , due to the following: (1) an   $80.8 million     increase   in net cash provided by operating activities primarily attributable to a sustainable reduction in working capital levels and an increase in cash from earnings and (2) a   $53.5 million     decrease   in capital expenditures.  See the "Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities" section above for further explanations of the change in operating cash flows. 

Debt Leverage Ratio 
    
  The Debt Leverage Ratio is defined as total debt and capital lease obligations divided by the sum of the following: (1) the last twelve months of EBITDA (see the definition of EBITDA and the reconciliation of net earnings (loss) to EBITDA in the "Results of Operations" section above); (2) restructuring, impairment and transaction-related charges; (3) non-cash goodwill impairment charges; (4) gain on debt extinguishment; and (5) equity in loss of unconsolidated entities. 
    
  The Company uses the Debt Leverage Ratio as a metric to assess liquidity and the flexibility of its balance sheet.  Consistent with other liquidity metrics, the Company monitors the Debt Leverage Ratio as a measure to determine the appropriate level of debt the Company believes is optimal to operate its business, and accordingly, to quantify debt capacity available for strategic capital allocation and deployment through investments in the business (capital expenditures and acquisitions), for strengthening the balance sheet (debt and pension liability reduction), and for returning capital to the shareholders (dividends and share repurchases).  The priorities for capital allocation and deployment will change as circumstances dictate for the business, and the Debt Leverage Ratio can be significantly impacted by the amount and timing of large expenditures requiring debt financing, as well as changes in profitability. 
    
  The Debt Leverage Ratio is a non-GAAP measure, and should not be considered an alternative to cash flows provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity.  Quad/Graphics' calculation of the Debt Leverage Ratio may be different from similar calculations used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited. 
    
  The Debt Leverage Ratio calculated below differs from both the total leverage ratio and senior secured leverage ratio included in the Company's debt covenant calculations (see   Note 10  , "  Debt  ," to the condensed consolidated financial statements in   Item 1  , "  Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)  ," of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information on debt covenants).  The total leverage ratio included in the Company's debt covenants includes letters of credit as debt, excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense from EBITDA and includes equity in loss of unconsolidated entities and certain pro forma historical results of acquisitions and divestitures in EBITDA.  Similarly, the senior secured leverage ratio included in the Company's debt covenants includes and excludes the same adjustments as the total leverage ratio, in addition to the exclusion of the outstanding balance of the Senior Unsecured Notes.

The Debt Leverage Ratio at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , was as follows: 

The calculation of EBITDA as adjusted for purposes of calculating the Debt Leverage Ratio for the trailing twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , was as follows: 

______________________________ 
     
  The Debt Leverage Ratio decreased 0.51x at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   December 31, 2015  , primarily due to a   $176.5 million   decrease in debt and capital lease obligations and $25.6 million of increased EBITDA, as adjusted for purposes of calculating the Debt Leverage Ratio.  The Debt Leverage Ratio at   September 30, 2016  , of   2.37x   is within management's desired target Debt Leverage Ratio range of   2.0x   to   2.5x  ; however, the Company operates at times above the Debt Leverage Ratio target range depending on the timing of compelling strategic investment opportunities and seasonal working capital needs.

Debt Obligations 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company utilized a combination of debt instruments to fund cash requirements, including the following: 

$1.9 billion   Debt Financing Arrangements, which includes the following: 

Senior Secured Credit Facility: 

The Company redeemed   $60.1 million   of its senior notes under the Master Note and Security Agreement and repurchased   $56.5 million   of its   Senior Unsecured Notes   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   for a total net gain of   $14.1 million   that was recognized in gain on debt extinguishment in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.  These repurchases were primarily completed to efficiently reduce debt balances and the Debt Leverage Ratio, as well as interest expense based on current LIBOR rates.  See   Note 10  , "  Debt  " to the condensed consolidated financial statements in   Item 1  , "  Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)  ," of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 

Covenants and Compliance 
    
  The Company's various lending arrangements include certain financial covenants (all financial terms, numbers and ratios are as defined in the Company's debt agreements).  Among these covenants, the Company was required to maintain the following as of   September 30, 2016  : 

Total Leverage Ratio.    On a rolling twelve-month basis, the total leverage ratio, defined as total consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA, shall not exceed   3.75   to 1.00 (for the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company's total leverage ratio was   2.36   to 1.00). 

Senior Secured Leverage Ratio.    On a rolling twelve-month basis, the senior secured leverage ratio, defined as senior secured debt to consolidated EBITDA, shall not exceed   3.50   to 1.00 (for the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company's senior secured leverage ratio was   1.88   to 1.00). 

Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio.    On a rolling twelve-month basis, the minimum interest coverage ratio, defined as consolidated EBITDA to consolidated cash interest expense, shall not be less than   3.50   to 1.00 (for the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company's minimum interest coverage ratio was   6.61   to 1.00). 
       
  The indenture underlying the Senior Unsecured Notes contains various covenants, including, but not limited to, covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, limit the Company's and its restricted subsidiaries' ability to incur and/or guarantee additional debt; pay dividends, repurchase stock or make certain other restricted payments; enter into agreements limiting dividends and certain other restricted payments; prepay, redeem or repurchase subordinated debt; grant liens on assets; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; merge, consolidate, transfer or dispose of substantially all of the Company's consolidated assets; sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of property and assets; and engage in transactions with affiliates. 

73 

     Table of Contents  

The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants in its debt agreements as of   September 30, 2016  .  While the Company currently expects to be in compliance in future periods with all of the financial covenants, there can be no assurance that these covenants will continue to be met.  The Company's failure to maintain compliance with the covenants could prevent the Company from borrowing additional amounts and could result in a default under any of the debt agreements.  Such default could cause the outstanding indebtedness to become immediately due and payable, by virtue of cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. 
    
  In addition to those covenants, the Senior Secured Credit Facility also includes certain limitations on acquisitions, indebtedness, liens, dividends and repurchases of capital stock, including the following: 

If the Company's total leverage ratio is greater than   3.00   to 1.00 (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility), the Company is prohibited from making greater than   $120.0 million   of annual dividend payments, capital stock repurchases and certain other payments.  If the total leverage ratio is less than   3.00   to 1.00, there are no such restrictions. 

If the Company's senior secured leverage ratio is greater than   3.00   to 1.00 or the Company's total leverage ratio is greater than   3.50   to 1.00 (these ratios as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility), the Company is prohibited from voluntarily prepaying any of the Senior Unsecured Notes and from voluntarily prepaying any other unsecured or subordinated indebtedness, with certain exceptions (including any mandatory prepayments on the Senior Unsecured Notes or any other unsecured or subordinated debt).  If the senior secured leverage ratio is less than   3.00   to 1.00 and the total leverage ratio is less than   3.50   to 1.00, there are no such restrictions. 

Net Pension Obligations 
    
  During 2016, the Company reduced its pension risk in two ways: 
    
           (1) 
    Facilitated lump-sum pension payments to terminated vested participants.  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company settled   $90.1 million   of pension liabilities for   $71.3 million   of pension payouts.  Payments to eligible participants who elected to receive a lump-sum pension payment were funded from existing pension plan assets and constituted a settlement of the Company s pension liabilities with respect to these participants. 
       
           (2) 
    Made contributions to the qualified pension plans of $10.8 million.  This included $10.4 million of contributions above the minimum statutory funding requirements, enabled by the Company's Free Cash Flow generation during 2016.  In addition to improving the funded status of the pension plans, these contributions also lowered future Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation premiums. 

Share Repurchase Program 
    
  On   September 6, 2011  , the Company's Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to   $100.0 million   of the Company's outstanding class A common stock.  Under the authorization, share repurchases may be made at the Company's discretion, from time to time, in the open market and/or in privately negotiated transactions as permitted by federal securities laws and other legal requirements.  The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchase will depend on economic and market conditions, share price, trading volume, applicable legal requirements and other factors.  The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.  There were   no   share repurchases during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  .  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased   984,190   shares of its class A common stock at a weighted average price of   $8.96   per share for a total purchase price of   $8.8 million  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   $82.9 million   of authorized repurchases remaining under the program.

ITEM 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
       
  The Company is exposed to a variety of market risks which may adversely impact the Company's results of operations and financial condition, including changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates, changes in the economic environment that would impact credit positions and changes in the prices of certain commodities.  The Company's management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks.  These risk management strategies may not fully insulate the Company from adverse impacts due to market risks. 

Interest Rate Risk 
    
  The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on variable rate debt obligations and price risk on fixed rate debt and capital leases.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had fixed rate debt and capital leases outstanding of   $447.3 million   at a current weighted average interest rate of   6.9%   and variable rate debt outstanding of   $725.5 million   at a current weighted average interest rate of   3.3%  .  The variable rate debt outstanding at   September 30, 2016  , is primarily comprised of the   $1.6 billion   Senior Secured Credit Facility entered into on   April 28, 2014  , including   $385.3 million   outstanding on the   $450.0 million   Term Loan A,   $291.3 million   outstanding on the   $300.0 million   Term Loan B and   $46.5 million   outstanding on the   $850.0 million   revolving credit facility.  The Term Loan B bears interest primarily based on LIBOR; however, it is subject to a 1.0% LIBOR minimum rate, and thus the interest rate on the Term Loan B will not begin to fluctuate until LIBOR exceeds that percentage.  At   September 30, 2016  , LIBOR was significantly lower than that 1.0% LIBOR minimum rate, and as a result the interest on the Term Loan B would not fluctuate with a 10% increase in the market interest rate.  Excluding the Term Loan B, a hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10% from the Company's current weighted average interest rate on variable rate debt obligations of   2.7%   would not have a material impact on the Company's interest expense.  A hypothetical 10% change in market interest rates would change the fair value of fixed rate debt at   September 30, 2016  , by approximately   $13 million  . 

Foreign Currency Risk and Translation Exposure 
    
  The Company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in certain countries in which it operates.  The exposure to foreign currency movements is limited in most countries because the operating revenues and expenses of its various subsidiaries and business units are substantially in the local currency of the country in which they operate.  To the extent revenues and expenses are not in the applicable local currency, the Company may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the currency risk. 
    
  Although operating in local currencies may limit the impact of currency rate fluctuations on the results of operations of the Company's non-United States subsidiaries and business units, rate fluctuations may impact the consolidated financial position as the assets and liabilities of its foreign operations are translated into United States dollars in preparing the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's foreign subsidiaries had net current assets (defined as current assets less current liabilities) subject to foreign currency translation risk of $53.8 million.  The potential decrease in net current assets as of   September 30, 2016  , from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates, would be approximately $5.4 million.  This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in all major foreign currency exchange rates versus the United States dollar.  Exchange rates rarely move in the same direction relative to the United States dollar due to positive and negative correlations of the various global currencies.  This assumption may overstate or understate the impact of changing exchange rates on individual assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency.

The Company's hedging operations have historically not been material, and gains or losses from these operations have not been material to the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
    
  These international operations are subject to risks typical of international operations, including, but not limited to, differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, potential restrictions on the movement of funds, differing tax structures, and other regulations and restrictions.  Accordingly, future results could be adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors. 

Credit Risk 
    
  Credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer's failure to make payments according to contract terms.  Prior to granting credit, each customer is evaluated in an underwriting process, taking into consideration the prospective customer's financial condition, past payment experience, credit bureau information and other financial and qualitative factors that may affect the customer's ability to pay.  Specific credit reviews and standard industry credit scoring models are used in performing this evaluation.  Customers' financial condition is continuously monitored as part of the normal course of business.  Some of the Company's customers are highly leveraged or otherwise subject to their own operating and regulatory risks.  Based on those customer account reviews and due to the continued uncertainty of the global economy, the Company has established an allowance for doubtful accounts of   $54.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , and   $50.1 million   as of   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The Company has a large, diverse customer base and does not have a high degree of concentration with any single customer account.  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company's largest customer accounted for less than 5% of the Company's net sales.  Even if the Company's credit review and analysis mechanisms work properly, the Company may experience financial losses in its dealings with customers and other parties.  Any increase in nonpayment or nonperformance by customers could adversely impact the Company's results of operations and financial condition.  Economic disruptions could result in significant future charges. 

Commodity Risk 
    
  The primary raw materials that Quad/Graphics uses in its print business are paper, ink and energy.  At this time, the Company's supply of raw materials is readily available from numerous vendors; however, based on market conditions, that could change in the future.  The Company generally buys these raw materials based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the procurement process. 
    
  The majority of paper used in the printing process is supplied directly by the Company's clients.  For those clients that do not directly supply their own paper, the Company makes use of its purchasing efficiencies to supply paper by negotiating with leading paper vendors, uses a wide variety of paper grades, weights and sizes, and does not rely on any one vendor.  In addition, the Company generally includes price adjustment clauses in sales contracts for paper and other critical raw materials in the printing process.  Although these clauses generally mitigate paper price risk, higher paper prices and tight paper supplies may have an impact on client demand for printed products.  The Company's working capital requirements, including the impact of seasonality, are partially mitigated through the direct purchasing of paper by its clients. 
    
  The Company produces the majority of ink used in its print production, allowing it to control the quality, cost and supply of key inputs.  Raw materials for the ink manufacturing process are purchased externally from a variety of vendors. 
    
  The Company generally cannot pass on to clients the impact of higher electric and natural gas energy prices on its manufacturing costs, and increases in energy prices result in higher manufacturing costs for certain of its operations.  The Company mitigates its risk through natural gas hedges when appropriate.  In its logistic operations, however, the Company is able to pass a substantial portion of any increase in fuel prices directly to its clients. 
    
  As a result, management believes a hypothetical 10% change in the price of paper and other raw materials would not have a significant direct impact on the Company's consolidated annual results of operations or cash flows; however, significant increases in commodity pricing or tight supply could influence future client demand for printed products.  Inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company historically.

    Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report and has concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

    On   September 6, 2011  , the Company's Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to   $100.0 million   of the Company's outstanding class A common stock.  Under the authorization, share repurchases may be made at the Company's discretion, from time to time, in the open market and/or in privately negotiated transactions as permitted by federal securities laws and other legal requirements.  The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchase will depend on economic and market conditions, share price, trading volume, applicable legal requirements and other factors.  The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.  There were   no   share repurchases during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  .  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased   984,190   shares of its class A common stock at a weighted average price of   $8.96   per share for a total purchase price of   $8.8 million  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   $82.9 million   of authorized repurchases remaining under the program.

Quad/Graphics, Inc. 
  Executive Severance Plan  
    
  Article 1. Establishment and Term of the Plan 
           1.1 
    Establishment of the Plan.   Quad/Graphics, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as the "Company") hereby establishes a severance plan to be known as the "Quad/Graphics, Inc. Executive Severance Plan" (the "Plan"). The Plan provides severance benefits to certain employees of the Company ("Executives") who (A) are listed in Appendix A and (B) have executed an acknowledgement and agreement to be bound by the terms of this Plan, upon certain terminations of their employment from the Company.  
       
  The Company considers the establishment and maintenance of a sound and vital management team to be essential to protecting and enhancing the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The Company desires to mitigate the risk of departure or distraction of management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders by increasing the retention incentives provided to its management team through severance protections that are competitive with the Company's peers.  
    
  Accordingly, the Board has determined that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of members of the Company's management to their assigned duties without distraction in circumstances arising from the possibility of a termination of employment or the possibility of a Change in Control of the Company. 
    
           1.2 
    Initial Term.   This Plan will commence on September 15, 2016 (the "Effective Date") and shall continue in effect for a period of three (3) years (the "Initial Term"). 
       
           1.3 
    Successive Periods; Notice.   The term of this Plan shall automatically be extended for one (1) additional year at the end of the Initial Term, and then again after each successive one (1) year period thereafter (each such one (1) year period following the Initial Term is referred to as a "Successive Period"). However, the Board or the Committee may terminate this Plan at the end of the Initial Term, or at the end of any Successive Period thereafter, by giving the then-covered Executives written notice of intent to terminate the Plan, delivered prior to the September 15th preceding the year in which such Initial Term or Successive Period is scheduled to end. If such notice is properly delivered by the Company, this Plan, along with all corresponding rights, duties, and covenants, shall automatically expire at the end of the Initial Term or Successive Period then in progress.      Each Executive shall be required to provide the Company with at least sixty (60) days' notice prior to terminating his or her employment other than for Good Reason or for Limited Good Reason. 
       
           1.4 
    Change in Control Renewal.   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.3 above, in the event that a Change in Control of the Company occurs during the Initial Term or any Successive Period, upon the effective date of such Change in Control, the term of this Plan shall automatically and irrevocably be renewed for a period of two (2) years from the effective date of such Change in Control and this Plan cannot be terminated prior to the end of such period. Further, this Plan shall be assumed and continued to the extent required by Section 7.1 herein. This Plan shall thereafter automatically terminate following such two (2) year Change in Control renewal period.

    any intentional, willful and material failure of Executive to perform Executive's employment duties (other than any such failure resulting from Executive's Disability) for thirty (30) days after the Board delivers a written demand for performance to Executive that specifically identifies the manner in which the Board believes that Executive has not substantially performed Executive's employment duties. 
       
  For purposes of this paragraph, no act or failure to act on the part of Executive shall be considered "intentional "or "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by Executive in bad faith and without reasonable belief that Executive's act or omission was in the best interests of the Company and its Affiliates, and any act or failure to act based upon authority pursuant to the Company's written policies or advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by Executive in good faith and in the best interests of the Company and its Affiliates.

Any payment that would have been made except for the application of the preceding sentence shall be made in accordance with the payment schedule that would have applied in the absence of the applicable Change in Control (and other Executive rights that are tied to a Change in Control shall not be affected by this paragraph).

Each Executive shall cooperate in all respects with the Company if a question arises as to whether the Executive has become Disabled (including, without limitation, submitting to an examination by a medical doctor or other health care specialists selected by the Company and authorizing such medical doctor or such other health care specialist to discuss the Executive's condition with the Company). 
       
           (k) 
    "Effective Date"   means the commencement date of this Plan as specified in Section 1.2 of this Plan. 
       
           (l) 
    "Effective Date of Termination"   means the date on which a Qualifying Change in Control Termination or a Qualifying General Severance Termination occurs, as defined hereunder.

    "Good Reason"   shall mean without the Executive's express written consent the occurrence of any one or more of the following: 
       
           (i) 
    The Company materially reduces the amount of the Executive's then current Base Salary or annual bonus target (other than any change that applies to substantially all other executive officers); or 
       
           (ii) 
    The Company requires the Executive to be based at a location in excess of sixty (60) miles from the location of the Executive's principal job location or office as of the effective date of the Executive's participation in the Plan; or

           (iv) 
    The failure of the Company to obtain the express assumption of, and agreement to perform under, this Plan when such action is required pursuant to Section 7.1 herein; or 
       
           (v) 
    Any other action or inaction by the Company that constitutes a material breach by the Company of the terms and conditions of this Plan. 
       
  For purposes of this Plan, the Executive is not entitled to assert that the termination is for Good Reason unless the Executive gives the Board written notice of the event or events which are the basis for such claim within ninety (90) days after the event or events occur, describing such claim in reasonably sufficient detail to allow the Board to address the event or events and a period of not less than thirty (30) days after such notice to cure or fully remedy the alleged condition.

For purposes of this Plan, the Executive is not entitled to assert that the termination is for Limited Good Reason unless the Executive gives the Board written  
     
   4 

notice of the event that is the basis for such claim within ninety (90) days after the event occurs, describing such claim in reasonably sufficient detail to allow the Board to address the event, and a period of not less than thirty (30) days after such notice to cure or fully remedy the alleged condition.

Anything in this Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, (A) if a Change in Control occurs and if the Executive's employment was terminated under circumstances that would have constituted a Qualifying Change in Control Termination except that it took place during the period from ninety (90) days prior to the date on which a definitive transaction agreement contemplating a Change in Control is signed until the consummation of such Change in Control, rather than on or after the Change in Control, and if it is reasonably demonstrated by the Executive that such termination of employment was due to the Change in Control, then for all purposes of this Plan such termination of employment shall be deemed a "Qualifying Change in Control Termination," with the applicable Severance Benefits (less any Severance Benefits that have previously been paid) being paid on the later of sixty (60) days after the termination or the Change in Control, and (B) if the Change in Control is a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and the purchaser of the assets in the Change in Control (or one of its affiliates) offers the Executive continuing employment following the Change in Control on substantially the same terms and conditions as were in effect prior to the Change in Control, then the Executive shall not be deemed to have a Qualifying Change in Control Termination solely by virtue of the termination of the Executive's employment with the Company upon the Change in Control and commencement of such continuing employment with the purchaser or one of its affiliates immediately after the Change in Control.

           (b)

           (c) 
    A lump-sum amount, paid on the sixtieth (60th) calendar day following the Effective Date of Termination, equal to the Executive's then current target bonus opportunity established under the bonus plan in which the Executive is then participating, for the plan year in which a Qualifying Change in Control Termination occurs (or, if the target bonus opportunity has not yet been established for such plan year, the target bonus opportunity for the prior year), adjusted on a pro rata basis based on the number of days the Executive was actually employed during the bonus plan year in which the Qualifying Change in Control Termination occurs. 
       
           (d) 
    A lump-sum amount paid on the sixtieth (60) calendar day following the Effective Date of Termination equal to the product of (i) two (2) and (ii) the annual employer contributions for the Executive's medical and life insurance coverage in effect for the year of termination. For purposes of calculating this amount, the employer contribution should be based on the same coverage level and cost to the Executive as in effect immediately prior to the Executive's Effective Date of Termination. 
       
           (e) 
    Treatment of outstanding long-term incentives shall be in accordance with Section 3.4 herein.

In the event the Executive becomes entitled to receive General Severance Benefits, as provided in Section 3.1(b) herein, the Company shall provide the Executive (or his dependents, if applicable, in the case of group health, dental and life insurance benefits) with the following: 
       
           (a) 
    A lump-sum amount paid promptly following the Effective Date of Termination equal to the Executive's accrued and unpaid Base Salary, accrued vacation pay, unreimbursed business expenses, and all other items earned by and owed to the Executive through and including the Effective Date of Termination. 
       
           (b)

           (d) 
    Group health, dental and life insurance benefits for twelve (12) months following the Effective Date of Termination to the extent that such benefits were in effect for the Executive and his family as of the Effective Date of Termination, subject to the Executive's timely election of group health and/or dental continuation coverage pursuant to COBRA or similar state laws and timely payment of his or her share of the applicable premiums at the same rate (if any) he or she was paying before the Effective Date of Termination.  Benefit continuation under this paragraph shall be concurrent with any coverage under the Company's plans pursuant to COBRA or similar state laws.  Such benefits shall be terminated to the extent permitted by COBRA (for health and dental coverage) at such time as Executive has obtained new employment and is covered by benefits which in  
     
   7 

the aggregate are comparable to such continued benefits.  The Executive shall promptly notify the Company when he or she becomes employed after the Effective Date of Termination and shall provide such reasonable cooperation as the Company requests with respect to determining whether the Executive is covered by comparable benefits with such new employer.  If provision of health or dental benefits under this paragraph would subject the Company or its benefits arrangements to a penalty or adverse tax treatment, then the Company shall provide a cash payment to the Executive in an amount reasonably determined by the Company to be equivalent to the portion of the COBRA premiums that the Company would have paid for such benefits. 
    
           (e) 
    Treatment of outstanding long-term incentives shall be in accordance with Section 3.4 herein. 
       
           (f)

           3.4 
    Impact on Long-Term Incentives.   All awards will be paid pursuant to the long-term incentive plan under which the award was granted, the related award agreement, or the Board's discretion. 

Article 4. Confidentiality and Noncompetition 
           4.1 
    During the Executive's employment with the Company and in the event the Executive has a termination of employment (regardless of whether the Executive becomes entitled to receive Change in Control Severance Benefits or General Severance Benefits as provided in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 herein), the following shall apply: 
       
           (a) 
    Noncompetition.   Executive acknowledges that he or she has obtained and will continue to obtain during employment with the Company, knowledge of Protected Information and Trade Secrets, and had personal involvement in the Company's customer relationships, that would, in the event Executive were to unfairly use or disclose that Protected Information or Trade Secrets or employ that personal involvement on behalf of a competitor of the Company or of any Applicable Affiliate, cause irreparable harm to the Company and/or the Applicable Affiliates. In return for at-will employment with the Company, and in consideration of the Executive's inclusion under this Plan, during the Executive's employment and for a period of twenty-four (24) months after the Executive's Effective Date of Termination (the "Noncompete Period"), the Executive shall not directly or indirectly (as a director, officer, employee, shareholder, investor, partner, consultant or otherwise) provide services under circumstances in which (i) disclosure or use of Protected Information or Trade Secrets known to Executive, or (ii) use of Executive's personal involvement in the Company's or any Applicable Affiliate's customer relationships, would reasonably be considered competitively beneficial to any other company, business, person or entity (including the Executive) who/which: (A) produces or sells, or plans to produce or sell, Restricted U.S. Products/Services within the continental United States, (B) produces or sells, or plans to produce or sell, Restricted Foreign Products in any country of the world in which the Applicable Foreign Affiliates sold products or services during the twenty-four (24) months prior to Executive's Effective Date of Termination, or (C) produces or sells, or plans to produce or sell, Other Restricted Products/Services in either the continental United States or in any country of the world in which the Applicable Foreign Affiliates sold products or services during the twenty-four (24) months prior to Executive's Effective Date of Termination. 
       
  Nothing in this Plan shall prohibit Executive's ownership of securities of a corporation that is listed on a national securities exchange or traded in the national over-the-counter market in an amount that does not exceed (together with any indirect or attributed ownership) five percent (5%) of the outstanding shares of any such corporation. 
    
           (b) 
    Nonsolicitation of Customers  .  For a period of twenty-four (24) months after the Executive's Effective Date of Termination, the Executive shall not solicit, for the purpose of selling Restricted Products/Services, any customer of the Company or any Applicable Affiliate: 
       
           i. 
    to whom/which the Company or its Applicable Affiliates have sold or provided Restricted Products/Services during the twenty-four (24) months prior to the Executive's Effective Date of Termination; and  
       
           ii. 
    with respect to whom/which the Executive received Protected Information or had substantial personal involvement in the customer relationship during the twenty-four (24) months prior to the Executive's Effective Date of Termination. 
       
           (c) 
    Nonsolicitation of Employees and Contractors.   During the Executive's employment and for a period of twenty-four (24) months after the Executive's Effective Date of Termination, the Executive shall not directly or indirectly: 
     
   8 

i. 
    solicit any individual who is employed or engaged as a contractor by the Company or the Applicable Affiliates and is someone with whom the Executive had personal contact or about whom Executive has learned (by name or by role) because of Executive's access to Protected Information during the twenty-four (24) months prior to the Executive's Effective Date of Termination (an "Employee/Contractor") for employment with, or as a provider of services to, a company, business, entity or person who competes with the Company or the Applicable Affiliates;  
       
           ii. 
    engage in discussions encouraging any Employee/Contractor to terminate his/her employment or engagement with the Company or any Applicable Affiliates;  
       
           iii. 
    in any way prompt any Employee/Contractor to diminish the services he/she/it provides to the Company or any Applicable Affiliates; or  
       
           iv. 
    assist any third party with respect to any of the foregoing.  
       
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section shall: 
    
           i. 
    prohibit the Executive from offering employment to, or having an independent contractor relationship with, any such person who initiates employment or independent contractor relationship discussions with Executive's then-current employer without any direct or indirect solicitation or involvement by Executive; or  
       
           ii. 
    during the term of the Executive's employment with the Company, restrict the Executive from encouraging any Employee/Contractor of the Company or any Applicable Affiliate to resign or to terminate his/her/its contractual relationship with the Company or any Applicable Affiliate, or from terminating any Employee/Contractor of the Company or any Applicable Affiliates, provided that such discussions are in the best interest of the Company or the Applicable Affiliates. 
       
           (d) 
    Confidentiality  . The Company has advised the Executive and the Executive acknowledges that it is the policy of the Company to maintain as secret and confidential all Protected Information and that Protected Information has been and will be developed at substantial cost and effort to the Company and the Applicable Affiliates. The Executive shall not, at any time during the Executive's employment with the Company or its Affiliates, and for a period of twenty-four (24) months after the Executive's Effective Date of Termination, directly or indirectly, divulge, furnish, or make accessible to any person, firm, corporation, association, or other entity (otherwise than as may be required in the regular course of the Executive's employment), any Protected Information, or cause any such Protected Information of the Company or an Applicable Affiliate to enter the public domain. Notwithstanding the limitations set forth above, the Executive understands and agrees to maintain the the secrecy of, and not to misappropriate, threaten to misappropriate or provide any assistance to anyone seeking to ascertain or reverse engineer, any Trade Secret of the Company or any Applicable Affiliates without limitation, except as provided under applicable trade secret law.  This Plan is in addition to and not in lieu of any obligations to protect the Company's Trade Secrets and Protected Information pursuant to the Company's written policies concerning Trade Secrets and Protected Information.  Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, nothing herein is intended to discourage or restrict the Executive from reporting any theft of Trade Secrets pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 ("DTSA") or other applicable state or federal law. The DTSA prohibits retaliation against an employee because of whistleblower activity in connection with the disclosure of Trade Secrets, so long as any such disclosure is made either (i) in confidence to an attorney or a federal, state, or local government official and solely to report or investigate a suspected violation of the law, or (ii) under seal in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding.  Nothing in this Plan shall limit, curtail or diminish the Company's statutory rights under the DTSA, any applicable state law regarding trade secrets or common law.  
       
           (e) 
    Executive Acknowledgement  .  Recognizing the specialized nature of the Company and the Applicable Affiliates, Executive acknowledges and agrees that the duration, geographic scope and activity restrictions of the covenants set forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this Article 4 are reasonable, are necessary to protect the Company's legitimate business interests, do not violate public policy, and will not prevent the Executive from earning a living. 
       
           (f) 
    Return of Information and Other Property.   On or before the last day of the Executive's employment with the Company (or any other time upon the Company's request), Executive shall deliver to the Company the original  
     
   9 

and all copies of all documents, records and property of any nature whatsoever, including, without limitation, telephones, computers, automobiles and other tangible personal property and any records, documents or property created by Executive that are in Executive's possession or control and that are the property of the Company or any of its Affiliates, except as authorized in writing or pursuant to the Company's then-existing policies permitting the withdrawing Executive to retain computers, cell phones or other items of Company property for their personal use. Executive further agrees that, within ten (10) days following the Executive's Effective Date of Termination, the Executive shall deliver to the Company a certificate to the effect that all Protected Information and Company Trade Secrets stored on any computer owned by the Executive or owned by any person residing with the Executive have been deleted. 
    
           (g) 
    Assignment/Cooperation.   Executive hereby assigns to the Company all of the Executive's right, title and interest in and to all Inventions. During Executive's employment with the Company and at all times thereafter, upon the request of an authorized executive officer of the Company, Executive shall do any reasonable act and thing to assist the Company in any way to vest in the Company all of Executive's right, title and interest in and to all Inventions and to obtain, defend and enforce the Company's rights in all Inventions including, without limitation, agreeing to testify in any suit or other proceeding involving any Invention or document, to review, return or sign all documents that the Company reasonably determines to be necessary or proper, and to apply for, obtain or enforce any patents or copyrights relating to any Invention. If, after reasonable effort, the Company cannot secure Executive's signature on any document or thing needed in connection with the actions specified in this paragraph, Executive hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as Executive's agent to act for and on Executive's behalf to execute, verify, and file any documents or do any other reasonable act or thing to further the purposes of this paragraph with the same force and effect as if executed or done by Executive.  The Company shall compensate Executive at a reasonable rate for time actually spent assisting the Company with any of the foregoing after the last day of Executive's employment with the Company.  Executive further waives all claims of any nature whatsoever which Executive now has or may in the future obtain for infringement of any rights assigned under this Plan or otherwise. 
       
           (h) 
    Nondisparagement.   At all times, the Executive agrees not to disparage the Company or otherwise make comments harmful to the Company's reputation. However, nothing in this provision will be construed to prevent the Executive from (i) testifying in response to a lawfully served subpoena, giving truthful testimony under oath, or otherwise complying with a lawful court or agency order; (ii) filing a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (or cross-filing any equivalent fair employment charge with any state or local fair employment agency); (iii) cooperating with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or any federal, state, or local fair employment agency; or (iv) filing a complaint or cooperating with any other government or law enforcement agency. 

Article 5. Excise Tax  
           5.1 
    Best Net  . It is the object of this paragraph to provide for the maximum after-tax income to each Executive with respect to any payment or distribution to or for the benefit of the Executive, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the Plan or any other plan, arrangement or agreement, that would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code) or any similar federal, state or local tax that may hereafter be imposed (a "Payment") (Section 4999 of the Code or any similar federal, state or local tax are collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax").  Accordingly, before any Payments are made under this Plan, a determination will be made as to which of two alternatives will maximize such Executive's after-tax proceeds, and the Company must notify the Executive in writing of such determination. The first alternative is the payment in full of all Payments potentially subject to the Excise Tax. The second alternative is the payment of only a part of the Executive's Payments so that the Executive receives the largest payment and benefits possible without causing the Excise Tax to be payable by the Executive.  This second alternative is referred to in this paragraph as "Limited Payment". The Executive's Payments shall be paid only to the extent permitted under the alternative determined to maximize the Executive's after-tax proceeds, and the Executive shall have no rights to any greater payments on his or her Payments.  If Limited Payment applies, Payments shall be reduced in a manner that would not result in the Executive incurring an additional tax under Code Section 409A. 
       
           (a) 
    Accordingly, Payments not constituting nonqualified deferred compensation under Code Section 409A shall be reduced first, in this order but only to the extent that doing so avoids the Excise Tax (e.g., accelerated vesting or payment provisions in an award will be ignored to the extent that such provisions would trigger the Excise Tax): 
       
           (i) 
    Payment of the Severance Benefits to the extent such payments do not constitute deferred compensation under Code Section 409A. 
     
   10 

(ii) 
    Awards that can be earned based on performance ("Performance-Based Awards"), but excluding Performance-Based Awards subject to Code Section 409A. 
       
           (iii) 
    Awards that can be earned solely on the passage of time ("Service-Based Awards"), but excluding Service-Based Awards subject to Code Section 409A. 
       
           (iv) 
    Awards of stock options and SARs under a Company omnibus or incentive plan. 
       
           (b) 
    Then, if the foregoing reductions are insufficient, Payments constituting deferred compensation under Code Section 409A shall be reduced, in this order: 
       
           (i) 
    Payment of the Severance Benefits to the extent such payments constitute deferred compensation under Code Section 409A. 
       
           (ii) 
    Performance-Based Awards subject to Code Section 409A. 
       
           (iii) 
    Service-Based Awards subject to Code Section 409A. 
       
  In the event of conflict between the order of reduction under this Plan and the order provided by any other Company document governing a Payment, then the order under this Plan shall control. 
    
  All determinations required to be made under this Article 5 shall be made by the Company's external auditor or another nationally recognized firm selected by the Company (the "Accounting Firm") which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within ten (10) business days of the termination of employment giving rise to benefits under the Plan, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company.  All fees, costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, the costs of retaining experts) of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the Company.  In the event the Accounting Firm determines that the Payments shall be reduced, it shall furnish the Executive with a written opinion to such effect.  The determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. 

Article 6. Legal Fees and Notice 
           6.1 
    Payment of Legal Fees.   Except as otherwise agreed to by the parties, the Company shall pay the Executive for costs of litigation or other disputes including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by the Executive in asserting any claims or defenses under this Plan, except that the Executive shall bear his/her own costs of such litigation or disputes (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees) if the court (or arbitrator) finds in favor of the Company with respect to any material claims or defenses asserted by the Executive. 
       
           6.2 
    Notice.   Any notices, requests, demands, or other communications provided for by this Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and if sent by registered or certified mail to the Executive at the last address he or she has filed in writing with the Company or, in the case of the Company, at its principal offices. 

Article 7. Successors and Assignment 
           7.1 
    Successors to the Company.   The Company shall require any person or entity (a) to which the Company sells, assigns or transfers all or substantially all of its business and assets, (b) into which the Company merges or consolidates or otherwise combines (where the Company does not survive such combination) or (c) that otherwise acquires or becomes a successor to the Company, whether or not in connection with a Change in Control (a "Surviving Entity") to expressly in writing assume and agree to perform under this Plan in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such transaction had taken place; provided that no such express assumption or agreement shall be required to the extent such assumption and obligation to perform occurs automatically by operation of law or to the extent the Surviving Entity is otherwise required to perform under this Plan without such assumption. Regardless of whether such agreement is executed, the terms of this Plan shall be binding upon any Surviving Entity in accordance with the operation of law and such Surviving Entity shall be deemed the "Company" for purposes of this Plan. 
       
           7.2 
    Assignment by the Executive.   This Plan shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees, and legatees. If the Executive dies while any amount would still be payable to him or her hereunder had he or she continued to  
     
   11 

live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Plan to the Executive's Beneficiary.  

Article 8. Miscellaneous 
           8.1. 
    Code Section 409A.    To the extent applicable, it is intended that the Plan comply with the provisions of Code Section 409A. The Plan will be administered and interpreted in a manner consistent with this intent, and any provision that would cause the Plan to fail to satisfy Code Section 409A will have no force and effect until amended to comply therewith (which amendment may be retroactive to the extent permitted by Code Section 409A).  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, for all purposes of this Plan, Executive shall not be deemed to have had a termination of employment until Executive has incurred a separation from service as defined in Treasury Regulation  1.409A-1(h) and, solely to the extent required to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Code Section 409A, payment of the amounts payable under the Plan that would otherwise be payable during the six-month period after the date of termination shall instead be paid on the first business day after the expiration of such six-month period, plus interest thereon, at a rate equal to the applicable "Federal short-term rate" (as defined in Code Section 1274(d)) for the month in which such date of termination occurs, from the respective dates on which such amounts would otherwise have been paid until the actual date of payment. In addition, for purposes of the Plan, each amount to be paid and each installment payment shall be construed as a separate, identified payment for purposes of Code Section 409A. With respect to expenses eligible for reimbursement under the terms of this Plan: (i) the amount of such expenses eligible for reimbursement in any taxable year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in another taxable year; and (ii) any reimbursements of such expenses shall be made no later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the related expenses were incurred, except, in each case, to the extent that the right to reimbursement does not provide for a "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of Code Section 409A. 
       
           8.2 
    Employment Status.   Except as may be provided under any other agreement between the Executive and the Company, the employment of the Executive by the Company is "at will" and may be terminated by either the Executive or the Company at any time, subject to applicable law. 
       
           8.3 
    Entire Plan  . This Plan supersedes any prior agreements or understandings, oral or written, between the parties hereto, with respect to the subject matter hereof, and constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, this Plan completely supersedes any and all prior employment agreements entered into by and between the Company and the Executive, and all amendments thereto, in their entirety.  
       
           8.4 
    Severability.   In the event that any provision or portion of this Plan shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions of this Plan shall be unaffected thereby and shall remain in full force and effect. 
       
           8.5 
    Tax Withholding.   The Company may withhold from any benefits payable under this Plan all federal, state, city, or other taxes as may be required pursuant to any law or governmental regulation or ruling. 
       
           8.6 
    Beneficiaries.   The Executive may designate one (1) or more persons or entities as the primary and/or contingent beneficiaries of any amounts to be received under this Plan. Such designation must be in the form of a signed writing acceptable to the Board or the Board's designee. The Executive may make or change such designation at any time.  The last designation filed with the Company prior to the date of the Executive's will be applicable. 
       
           8.7 
    Payment Obligation Absolute.   The Company's obligation to make the payments provided for herein shall be absolute and unconditional, and shall not be affected by any circumstances, including, without limitation, any offset, counterclaim, recoupment, defense, or other right which the Company may have against the Executive or anyone else.  
       
  The Executive shall not be obligated to seek other employment in mitigation of the amounts payable or arrangements made under any provision of this Plan, and the obtaining of any such other employment shall in no event affect any reduction of the Company's obligations to make the payments and arrangements required to be made under this Plan.  
    
           8.8 
    Contractual Rights to Benefits.   Subject to approval and ratification by the Board, this Plan establishes and vests in the Executive a contractual right to the benefits to which he or she is entitled hereunder. However, nothing herein contained shall require or be deemed to require, or prohibit or be deemed to prohibit, the Company to  
     
   12 

segregate, earmark, or otherwise set aside any funds or other assets, in trust or otherwise, to provide for any payments to be made or required hereunder. 
    
           8.9 
    Modification; Survival.   No provision of this Plan may be modified, waived, or discharged in a manner adverse to an Executive unless such modification, waiver, or discharge is agreed to in a writing signed by the affected Executive and by an authorized member of the Committee, or by the respective parties' legal representatives and successors.  Additional executives may be added to Appendix A by the Committee from time to time provided that the Executive meets the requirements of Section 1.1.  The termination of this Plan pursuant to Section 1.3 or Section 1.4 shall not affect (A) any obligation of the Company to pay any Severance Benefits due to a Qualifying Change in Control Termination or a Qualifying General Severance Termination occurring prior to the effective date of such termination or (B) the obligations of the Executives pursuant to Article 4. 
       
           8.10 
    Gender and Number.   Except where otherwise indicated by the context, any masculine term used herein also shall include the feminine; the plural shall include the singular and the singular shall include the plural. 
       
           8.11 
    Applicable Law.   To the extent not preempted by the laws of the United States, the internal laws of the state of Wisconsin (without regard to its laws concerning choice of law) shall be the controlling law in all matters relating to this Plan.

  1.   The following new Section 1(c) is added immediately following Section 1(b) of the Agreement: 
    
  "(c)   Change in Control Extension.   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1(a) and 1(b) above, in the event that a Change in Control occurs during the term of the Executive's employment under this Agreement, upon the effective date of such Change in Control, the term of this Agreement shall automatically and irrevocably be extended for a period of two years from the effective date of such Change in Control. Further, this Agreement shall be assumed and continued to the extent required by Section 13. This Agreement shall thereafter automatically terminate following such two year Change in Control extension period."  
    
  [  For Mr. Fowler only  :    Section 2(a) is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following  : 
    
  "(a)      Position, Duties and Location  . Executive shall serve the Company as its Vice Chairman and Executive Vice President of Strategy and Corporate Development, with responsibility for the Company's strategy and corporate development, and in such other capacities consistent with Executive's role as Vice Chairman and Executive Vice President of Strategy and Corporate Development as may be reasonably assigned from time to time to Executive by the Company's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or Board of Directors.

  "In addition, if the Executive's employment with the Company pursuant to this Agreement is terminated by the Company for Cause or by the Executive for any reason other than Good Reason or by reason of the Executive's death or Disability, then, subject to any contrary provisions in the documents governing the applicable bonus or long-term incentive compensation arrangements, Executive shall be deemed to have forfeited the right to receive all amounts accrued during the fiscal year of termination under the bonus and long-term incentive compensation arrangements described in Section 3(b) and the Company shall have no obligation to pay the Executive any amounts arising under such arrangements. Upon the termination of the Executive's employment with the Company pursuant to this Agreement due to death or Disability, the Executive (or his beneficiaries or estate) shall, subject to any provisions in the documents governing the applicable bonus or long-term incentive compensation arrangements that are more favorable to the Executive, be entitled to receive all amounts accrued under the bonus and long-term incentive compensation arrangements described in Section 3(b) in proportion to the number of days worked in the relevant year, with the bonus and incentive compensation amounts determined by the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors at a time and in a manner consistent with the arrangements then in effect with any similar awards given to other executive officers." 

1 

3.   Sections 6(b), 6(c), 6(d) and 6(e) of the Agreement are deleted in their entirety and replaced with the following:  
    
  "(b)   Release and Waiver.     As a condition to receiving benefits under either Section 6(c) (other than Section 6(c)(i) to the extent required by law) or Section 6(d) (other than Section 6(d)(i) to the extent required by law) herein, Executive shall be obligated to execute a general release of claims in favor of the Company, its current and former affiliates and shareholders, and the current and former directors, officers, employees, and agents of the Company in a form acceptable to the Company. The general release of claims must be provided to the Company prior to the thirtieth (30th) day following Executive's Qualifying Termination Date; provided that the Company provides the form of release to the Executive within fifteen (15) days following the Qualifying Termination Date. 
    
  (c)   Qualifying General Severance Termination.   In the event Executive's employment is terminated in a Qualifying General Severance Termination, the Company shall provide Executive with the following: 
    
  (i)  A lump sum amount paid promptly following Executive's Qualifying Termination Date equal to the Executive's unpaid Base Salary, accrued vacation pay, unreimbursed business expenses, and all other items earned by and owed to the Executive through and including the Qualifying Termination Date. 
    
  (ii)  An amount equal to the product of (A) the Executive's General Severance Multiple and (B) the sum of the following: (1) the Executive's Termination Base Salary and (2) the Executive's annual target bonus opportunity in the year of termination, paid in substantially equal installments in accordance with the Company's customary payroll practices over the [twenty-four (24)] [OR] [eighteen (18)] month period commencing on the first payroll date following the sixtieth (60th) calendar day after the Qualifying Termination Date. The term 'General Severance Multiple' shall mean [two (2)] [OR] [one and one-half (1.5)].  
    
  (iii)  A lump sum amount, if any, paid within two and one half months after the end of the calendar year that includes Executive's Qualifying Termination Date, equal to the actual bonus that would have been payable to the Executive for the calendar year that includes the Termination Date based on actual performance if the Executive had remained employed through the end of such calendar year; provided however, that such amount shall be adjusted on a pro rata basis based on the number of days the Executive was actually employed during the bonus plan year in which the Qualifying General Severance Termination occurs.  
    
  (iv)  Group health, dental and life insurance benefits for [twenty-four (24)] [OR] [eighteen (18)]  months following the Qualifying Termination Date to the extent that such benefits were in effect for the Executive and his family as of the Qualifying Termination Date, subject to the Executive's timely election of group health and/or dental continuation coverage pursuant to COBRA or similar state laws and timely payment of his share of the applicable premiums at the same rate (if any) he was paying before the Qualifying Termination Date.  Benefit continuation under this paragraph shall be concurrent with any coverage under the Company's plans pursuant to COBRA or similar state laws.  Such benefits shall be terminated to the extent permitted by COBRA (for health and dental coverage) at such time as Executive has obtained new employment and is covered by benefits which in the aggregate are comparable to such continued benefits.  The Executive shall promptly notify the Company when he becomes employed after the Qualifying Termination Date and shall provide such reasonable cooperation as the Company requests with respect to determining whether the Executive is covered by comparable benefits with such new employer.  If provision of health or dental benefits under this paragraph would subject the Company or its benefits arrangements to a penalty or adverse tax treatment, then the Company shall provide a cash payment to the Executive in an amount reasonably determined by the Company to be equivalent to the portion of the COBRA premiums that the Company would have paid for such benefits. 
    
  (v)  Outplacement services through the provider of the Company's choice with the total cost not to exceed $50,000. In no event shall such outplacement services continue for more than two (2) years following Executive's Qualifying Termination Date. 
    
  (vi)  Except as otherwise provided in Section 6(h), outstanding long-term incentive awards shall be paid pursuant to the long-term incentive plan under which the award was granted, the related award agreement or the  discretion of the Company's Board of Directors.   
    
  (d)   Qualifying Change in Control Termination  . In the event Executive's employment is terminated in a Qualifying Change in Control Termination, the Company shall provide Executive with the following: 

2 

(i)  A lump sum amount paid promptly following Executive's Qualifying Termination Date equal to the Executive's unpaid Base Salary, accrued vacation pay, unreimbursed business expenses, and all other items earned by and owed to the Executive through and including the Termination Date.  
    
  (ii)  A lump sum amount paid on the sixtieth (60th) calendar day following Executive's Qualifying Termination Date equal to the product of (A) the Executive's Change in Control Severance Multiple and (B) the sum of the following: (1) the Executive's Termination Base Salary and (2) the Executive's annual target bonus opportunity in the year of termination (or, if more favorable to the Executive, the Executive's annual target bonus opportunity for the year of the Change in Control); provided that, to the extent such amount, together with any other amounts required to be aggregated with such amount under Code Section 409A, exceeds the amount that is exempt from Code Section 409A, such excess shall be paid in installments on the schedule provided for in the Agreement prior to its amendment to the extent required for compliance with Code Section 409A, subject to any six-month delay required by Code Section 409A. The term 'Change in Control Severance Multiple' shall mean [three (3)] [OR] [two and one-half (2.5)] [OR] [two (2)].  
    
  (iii)  A lump sum amount paid on the sixtieth (60th) calendar day following Executive's Qualifying Termination Date, equal to the Executive's then current target bonus opportunity established under the bonus plan in which the Executive is then participating, for the plan year in which a Qualifying Change in Control Termination occurs (or, if the target bonus opportunity has not yet been established for such plan year, the target bonus opportunity for the prior year), adjusted on a pro rata basis based on the number of days the Executive was actually employed during the bonus plan year in which the Qualifying Change in Control Termination occurs; provided that, to the extent such amount, together with any other amounts required to be aggregated with such amount under Code Section 409A, exceeds the amount that is exempt from Code Section 409A, such excess shall be paid in installments on the schedule provided for in the Agreement prior to its amendment to the extent required for compliance with Code Section 409A, subject to any six-month delay required by Code Section 409A.  
    
  (iv)  A lump sum amount paid on the sixtieth (60th) calendar days following Executive's Qualifying Termination Date equal to the product of (i) the Executive's Change in Control Severance Multiple (as defined in 6(d)(ii)) and (ii) the employer contributions for the Executive's medical and life insurance coverage in effect for the year of termination; provided that, to the extent such amount, together with any other amounts required to be aggregated with such amount under Code Section 409A, exceeds the amount that is exempt from Code Section 409A, such excess shall be paid in installments on the schedule provided for in the Agreement prior to its amendment to the extent required for compliance with Code Section 409A, subject to any six-month delay required by Code Section 409A. For purposes of calculating this benefit, the employer contribution should be based on the same coverage level and cost to the Executive as in effect immediately prior to the Executive's Qualifying Termination Date. 
    
  (v)  Outplacement services through the provider of the Company's choice with the total cost not to exceed $50,000. In no event shall such outplacement services continue for more than two (2) years following Executive's Qualifying Termination Date.  
    
  (vi)  Full vesting of Executive's accrued benefit as of the Executive's Qualifying Termination Date under the Company's Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (or any successor plan thereto).

"9.      Confidentiality and Noncompetition  .    During Executive's employment under this Agreement and in the event the Executive has a termination of employment (regardless of whether the Executive becomes entitled to receive Change in Control Severance Benefits or General Severance Benefits as provided herein), the following shall apply:     
    
  (a)      Noncompetition  . Executive acknowledges that he has obtained and will continue to obtain during employment with the Company, knowledge of Protected Information and Trade Secrets, and had personal involvement in the Company's customer relationships, that would, in the event Executive were to unfairly use or disclose that Protected Information or Trade Secrets or employ that personal involvement on behalf of a competitor of the Company or of any Applicable Affiliate, cause irreparable harm to the Company and/or the Applicable Affiliates.  In return for at-will employment with the Company, and in consideration of the Company's providing this Agreement as amended, during the Executive's employment and for a period of twenty-four (24) months after the Executive's Qualifying Termination Date (the "Noncompete Period"), the Executive shall not directly or indirectly (as a director, officer, employee, shareholder, investor, partner, consultant or otherwise) provide services under circumstances in which (i) disclosure or use of Protected Information or Trade Secrets known to Executive or (ii) use of Executive's personal involvement in the Company's or any Applicable Affiliate's customer relationships would reasonably be considered competitively beneficial  to any other company, business, person or entity (including the Executive) who/which: (A) produces or sells, or plans to produce or sell, Restricted U.S. Products/Services within the continental United States, (B) produces or sells, or plans to produce or sell, Restricted Foreign Products in any country of the world in which the Applicable Foreign Affiliates sold products or services during the twenty-four (24) months prior to Executive's Qualifying Termination Date, or (C) produces or sells, or plans to produce or sell, Other Restricted Products/Services in either the continental United States or in any country of the world in which the Applicable Foreign Affiliates sold products or services during the twenty-four (24) months prior to Executive's Qualifying Termination Date. 
  Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Executive's ownership of securities of a corporation that is listed on a national securities exchange or traded in the national over-the-counter market in an amount that does not exceed (together with any indirect or attributed ownership) five percent (5%) of the outstanding shares of any such corporation. 
    
  (b)      Nonsolicitation of Customers  .  For a period of twenty-four (24) months after the Executive's Qualifying Termination Date, the Executive shall not solicit, for the purpose of selling Restricted Products/Services, any customer of the Company:   
    
  (i)  to whom/which the Company or its Applicable Affiliates have sold or provided Restricted Products/Services during the twenty-four (24) months prior to the Executive's Qualifying Termination Date; and  
    
  (ii)  with respect to whom/which the Executive received Protected Information or had substantial personal involvement in the customer relationship during the twenty-four (24) months prior to the Executive's Qualifying Termination Date. 
    
  (c)      Nonsolicitation of Employees and Contractors  . During the Executive's employment and for a period of twenty-four (24) months after the Executive's Qualifying Termination Date, the Executive shall not directly or indirectly: 
    
  (i)  solicit any individual who is employed or engaged as a contractor by the Company or the Applicable Affiliates and is someone with whom the Executive had personal contact or about whom Executive has learned (by name or by role) because of Executive's access to Protected Information during the twenty-four (24) months prior to the Executive's Qualifying Termination Date (an "Employee/Contractor") for employment with, or as a provider of services to, a company, business, entity or person who competes with the Company or the Applicable Affiliates; 
    
  (ii)  engage in discussions encouraging any Employee/Contractor to terminate his/her employment or engagement with the Company or any Applicable Affiliates;  
    
  (iii)  in any way prompt any Employee/Contractor to diminish the services he/she/it provides to the Company or any Applicable Affiliates; or  
    
  (iv)  assist any third party with respect to any of the foregoing.  
    
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this section shall:  
    
           (x) 
    prohibit the Executive from offering employment to, or having an independent contractor relationship with, any such person who initiates employment or independent contractor relationship discussions with Executive's then-current employer without any direct or indirect solicitation or involvement by Executive; or  

4 

(y) 
    during the term of the Executive's employment with the Company, restrict the Executive from encouraging any Employee/Contractor of the Company or any Applicable Affiliate to resign or terminate his/her/its contractual relationship with the Company or any Applicable Affiliate, or from terminating any Employee/Contractor of the Company or any Applicable Affiliates, provided that such discussions are in the best interest of the Company or the Applicable Affiliates.  
       
  (d)      Confidentiality  . The Company has advised the Executive and the Executive acknowledges that it is the policy of the Company to maintain as secret and confidential all Protected Information and that Protected Information has been and will be developed at substantial cost and effort to the Company and the Applicable Affiliates. The Executive shall not, at any time during the Executive's employment with the Company or its Affiliate, and for a period of twenty-four (24) months after the Executive's Qualifying Termination Date, directly or indirectly, divulge, furnish, or make accessible to any person, firm, corporation, association, or other entity (otherwise than as may be required in the regular course of the Executive's employment), any Protected Information, or cause any such Protected Information of the Company or an Applicable Affiliate to enter the public domain. Notwithstanding the limitations set forth above, the Executive understands and agrees to maintain the secrecy of, and not to misappropriate, threaten to misappropriate or provide any assistance to anyone seeking to ascertain or reverse engineer, any Trade Secret of the Company or any Applicable Affiliates without limitation, except as provided under applicable trade secret law.  This Agreement is in addition to and not in lieu of any obligations to protect the Company's Trade Secrets and Protected Information pursuant to the Company's written policies concerning Trade Secrets and Protected Information.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing herein is intended to discourage or restrict the Executive from reporting any theft of Trade Secrets pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 ("DTSA") or other applicable state or federal law. The DTSA prohibits retaliation against an employee because of whistleblower activity in connection with the disclosure of Trade Secrets, so long as any such disclosure is made either (i) in confidence to an attorney or a federal, state, or local government official and solely to report or investigate a suspected violation of the law, or (ii) under seal in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding.  Nothing in this Agreement shall limit, curtail or diminish the Company's statutory rights under the DTSA, any applicable state law regarding trade secrets or common law. 
    
  (e)      Executive Acknowledgement  .  Recognizing the specialized nature of the Company and the Applicable Affiliates, Executive acknowledges and agrees that the duration, geographic scope and activity restrictions of the covenants set forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this Section 9 are reasonable, are necessary to protect the Company's legitimate business interests, do not violate public policy, and will not prevent the Executive from earning a living.  
    
  (f)      Return of Information and Other Property  . On or before the last day of the Executive's employment with the Company (or any other time upon the Company's request), Executive shall deliver to the Company the original and all copies of all documents, records and property of any nature whatsoever, including, without limitation, telephones, computers, automobiles and other tangible personal property and any records, documents or property created by Executive that are in Executive's possession or control and that are the property of the Company or any of its Affiliates, except as authorized in writing or pursuant to the Company's then existing policies permitting withdrawing Executive to retain computers, cell phones or other items of Company property for their personal use. Executive further agrees that, within ten (10) days following the Qualifying Termination Date, the Executive shall deliver to the Company a certificate to the effect that all Protected Information and Company Trade Secrets stored on any computer owned by the Executive or owned by any person residing with the Executive have been deleted."

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, for all purposes of this Agreement, Executive shall not be deemed to have had a termination of employment until Executive has incurred a separation from service as defined in Treasury Regulation  1.409A-1(h) and, solely to the extent required to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Code Section 409A, payment of the amounts payable under this Agreement that would otherwise be payable during the six-month period after the date of termination shall instead be paid on the first business day after the expiration of such six-month period, plus interest thereon, at a rate equal to the applicable "Federal short-term rate" (as defined in Code Section 1274(d)) for the month in which such date of termination occurs, from the respective dates on which such amounts would otherwise have been paid until the actual date of payment.

With respect to expenses eligible for reimbursement under the terms of this Agreement: (i) the amount of such expenses eligible for reimbursement in any taxable year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in another taxable year; and (ii) any reimbursements of such expenses shall be made no later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the related expenses were incurred, except, in each case, to the extent that the right to reimbursement does not provide for a "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of Code Section 409A." 
    
  [  For Mr. Fowler only  :    New Section 13(o) is added: 
    
  "(o)    Notices.
