CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS  

This Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q (this  Report ) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.
In particular, statements pertaining to our capital resources, healthcare facility performance and results of operations, among
others, contain forward-looking statements. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology
including, but not limited to,  believes,   expects,   may,   will,   should, 
 seeks,   approximately,   intends,   plans,   estimates  or  anticipates 
or the negative of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases which are predictions of or indicate future events or trends
and which do not relate solely to historical matters. You can also identify forward-looking statements by discussions of strategy,
plans or intentions. 

Forward-looking statements
involve numerous risks and uncertainties and you should not rely on them as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements
depend on assumptions, data or methods which may be incorrect or imprecise and we may not be able to realize them. We do not guarantee
that the transactions and events described will happen as described (or that they will happen at all). The following factors,
among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking
statements:

On June 13, 2016,
in anticipation of the Company s initial public offering that closed on July 1, 2016, the board of directors of the Company
approved an amendment and restatement of the Company s Amended and Restated Bylaws (as amended and restated, the  Bylaws ),
effective on that date. The following is a summary of the amendments to the Bylaws. In addition to the amendments described below,

(b)

On June 28, 2016,
the Company, the Advisor, and the Operating Partnership entered into an Underwriting Agreement with Wunderlich Securities, Inc.,
as representative of the several underwriters named therein, relating to the offer and sale of the Company s common stock
in its initial public offering. On July 1, 2016, the Company closed its initial public offering and issued 13,043,479 shares of
its common stock at a price of $10.00 per share resulting in gross proceeds of $130,434,790. After deducting amounts that the
Company paid in costs that were directly attributable to the offering, underwriting discounts, advisory fees, and commissions,
for a total of $11,272,068, the Company received net proceeds from the offering of $119,162,722. Additionally, on July 11, 2016
the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full, resulting in the issuance by the Company of an additional 1,956,521
shares of the Company s common stock at a price of $10.00 per share for gross proceeds of $19,565,210. After deducting underwriting
discounts, advisory fees, and commissions of $1,369,565, the Company received net proceeds from the over-allotment option shares
of $18,195,645. Transaction costs incurred in connection with the offering were approximately $1,681,259. As disclosed in Note
2    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,  these transaction costs were recorded as a deferred asset.
On July 1, 2016, upon completion of the initial public offering, this deferred asset balance was netted against additional paid-in
capital on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2016. Total shares issued by the Company in the initial
public offering, including over-allotment option shares, were 15,000,000 shares and the total net proceeds received were $137,358,367.

Use of Proceeds:  

The Company designated
the following uses for the net proceeds of the initial public offering:

                                         termination fee of $0.3 million) to repay the outstanding loan from Capital One encumbering
                                         the Company s Omaha Facility on July 11, 2016 (see Note 4    Notes
                                         Payable Related to Acquisitions );

                                         million to repay a portion of the Company s outstanding 8.0% convertible debentures
                                         held by ZH USA, LLC on July 8, 2016 (see Note 6    Related Party Transactions );

$1.5
                                         million to repay the outstanding interest free loan from ZH USA, LLC on July 8, 2016
                                         (see Note 6    Related Party Transactions ); and    

the
                                         remaining approximately $101.6 million for the acquisition of properties in the Company s
                                         investment pipeline, properties under letter of intent and other potential acquisitions,
                                         capital improvements to the Company s properties and general corporate and working
                                         capital purposes. See Note 3    Property Portfolio  for proceeds used
                                         to acquire properties during the quarter.    

The Company invested
the unexpended net proceeds of the offering in interest-bearing accounts, money market accounts, and interest-bearing securities
in a manner that is consistent with its intention to qualify for taxation as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ). 

In connection with
the Company s initial public offering, the Company s common stock was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under
the ticker symbol  GMRE.

These LTIP units represent  noncontrolling interests  and have no value as of September 30, 2016 as they have not been converted into OP Units and therefore did not participate in the Company s consolidated net loss. At the time when there is value associated with the noncontrolling interests, the Company will classify such interests as a component of consolidated equity, separate from the Company s total stockholder s equity on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, net income or loss will be allocated to noncontrolling interests based on their respective ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership. All material intercompany balances and transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated.

in escrow funds that were expended to acquire facilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Refer to Note 3  
 Property Portfolio  and Note 4    Notes Payable Related to Acquisitions,  respectively, for information
regarding the facilities acquired and details regarding the Cantor Loan. 

Deferred Assets  

The deferred assets
balance of $245,619 as of September 30, 2016, represented the Company s deferred rent receivable balance resulting from
the straight lining of revenue recognized for applicable tenant leases. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
deferred and paid $1,610,908 in specific incremental costs directly attributable to the offering of its equity securities bringing
the total deferred incremental costs incurred balance to $1,681,259. Deferral of these incremental costs is in accordance with
the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 340,  Other Assets and Deferred Costs. 
Also in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 340, upon the completion of the Company s initial public offering on
July 1, 2016, the $1,681,259 total deferred incremental cost balance was reclassified as a reduction of the Company s additional
paid-in capital balance in the Company s accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred asset balance as of December

such as real estate taxes and in some cases insurance, on the tenants  behalf. See Note 3    Property Portfolio

Stock-Based Compensation  

As disclosed in Note
7    2016 Equity Incentive Plan,  the Company grants LTIP unit awards to employees of its advisor and its affiliates,
and to the Company s independent directors. The Company expenses the fair value of unit awards in accordance with the fair
value recognition requirements of ASC Topic 718,  Compensation-Stock Compensation  and ASC Topic 505,  Equity. 
These ASC topics require companies to measure the cost of the recipient services received in exchange for an award of an equity
instrument based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Under ASC Topic 718, the Company s independent directors are
deemed to be employees and therefore compensation expense for these units is recognized based on the price of $10.00 per unit,
the closing share price for the Company s common stock at the closing date of the initial public offering on July 1, 2016,
ratably over the 12-month service period, using the straight line method. Under ASC Topic 505, the employees of the Advisor and
its affiliates are deemed to be non-employees of the Company and therefore compensation expense for these units is recognized
using the share price of the Company s common stock at the end of the reporting period, ratably over the 42-month or 54-month
service period, respectively, depending on the grant terms, using the straight line method. Total compensation expense of $830,827
related to all of the Company s LTIP units was recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and was classified
as  General and Administrative  expense in the Company s accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

Net Loss Per Common Share  

Basic net loss per
common share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the period. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders
by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus any potential dilutive shares for the period. 
The effect of the conversion of vested LTIP units into OP Units and the conversion of OP Units into common stock is not reflected
in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share, as all units are exchangeable for common stock on a one-for-one basis
and are anti-dilutive to the Company s net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company considered
the requirements of the two-class method when computing earnings per share. Earnings per share would not be affected by using
the two-class method because the Company incurred a net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Initial
Management Agreement   

On November 10, 2014,
the Company entered into a management agreement, with an effective date of April 1, 2014, with Inter-American Management LLC (the
 Advisor ), a Delaware limited liability company and an affiliate of the Company. ZH International Holdings Limited
(formerly known as Heng Fai Enterprises, Ltd.), a Hong Kong limited company that is engaged in real estate development, investments,
management and sales, hospitality management and investments and REIT management, is the 85% owner of the Advisor. ZH International
Holdings Limited owns ZH USA, LLC, a related party and the Company s former (pre initial public offering) majority stockholder.
Under the terms of this initial management agreement, the Advisor is responsible for designing and implementing the Company s
business strategy and administering its business activities and day-to-day operations. For performing these services, the Company
was obligated under the initial management agreement to pay the Advisor a base management fee equal to the greater of (a) 2.0%
per annum of the Company s net asset value (the value of the Company s assets less the value of the Company s
liabilities), or (b) $30,000 per calendar month. Additionally, in accordance with the terms of the initial management agreement,
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company expensed $754,000 that was paid to the Advisor for the acquisitions
of the Plano, Melbourne and Westland Facilities, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company

Amended Management Agreement   

Upon completion of
the Company s initial public offering on July 1, 2016, the Company and the Advisor entered into an amended and restated
management agreement. Terms of the amended and restated management agreement are as follows: 

Term and Termination  

The initial term of
the amended and restated management agreement will expire on the third anniversary of the closing date of the initial public offering
and will automatically renew for an unlimited number of successive one-year periods thereafter, unless the agreement is not renewed
or is terminated in accordance with its terms. If the Company s board of directors decides to terminate or not renew the
amended and restated management agreement, the Company will generally be required to pay the Advisor a termination fee equal to
three times the sum of the average annual base management fee and the average annual incentive compensation with respect to the
previous eight fiscal quarters ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter prior to termination. Subsequent to the initial term,
the Company may terminate the management agreement only under certain circumstances. 

Base Management Fee  

The Company will pay
its advisor a base management fee in an amount equal to: 1.5% of its stockholders  equity per annum, calculated quarterly
for the most recently completed fiscal quarter and payable in quarterly installments in arrears. 

For purposes of calculating
the base management fee, the Company s stockholders  equity means: (a) the sum of (1) the Company stockholders 
equity as of March 31, 2016, (2) the aggregate amount of the conversion price (including interest) for the conversion of the Company s
outstanding convertible debentures into common stock and OP units upon completion of the initial public offering, and (3) the
net proceeds from (or equity value assigned to) all issuances of equity and equity equivalent securities (including common stock,
common stock equivalents, preferred stock, long-term incentive plan ( LTIP ) units and OP units issued by the Company
or the Operating Partnership) in the initial public offering, or in any subsequent offering (allocated on a pro rata daily basis
for such issuances during the fiscal quarter of any such issuance), less (b) any amount that the Company pays to repurchase shares
of its common stock or equity securities of the OP. Stockholders  equity also excludes (1) any unrealized gains and losses
and other non-cash items (including depreciation and amortization) that have impacted stockholders  equity as reported in
the Company s financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, and (2) one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP,
and certain non-cash items not otherwise described above, in each case after discussions between the Advisor and its independent
directors and approval by a majority of the Company s independent directors. As a result, the Company s stockholders 
equity, for purposes of calculating the base management fee, could be greater or less than the amount of stockholders  equity
shown on its financial statements. 

The base management
fee of the Advisor shall be calculated within 30 days after the end of each quarter and such calculation shall be promptly delivered
to the Company. The Company is obligated to pay the quarterly installment of the base management fee calculated for that quarter
in cash within five business days after delivery to the Company of the written statement of the Advisor setting forth the computation
of the base management fee for such quarter. 

Incentive Compensation Fee  

The Company will pay
its advisor an incentive fee with respect to each calendar quarter (or part thereof that the management agreement is in effect)
in arrears. The incentive fee will be an amount, not less than zero, equal to the difference between (1) the product of (x) 20%
and (y) the difference between (i) the Company s AFFO (as defined below) for the previous 12-month period, and (ii) the
product of (A) the weighted average of the issue price of equity securities issued in the initial public offering and in future
offerings and transactions, multiplied by the weighted average number of all shares of common stock outstanding on a fully-diluted
basis (including any restricted stock units, any restricted shares of common stock, OP units, LTIP units, and shares of common
stock underlying awards granted under the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan or any future plan in the previous 12-month period, and (B)
8%, and (2) the sum of any incentive fee paid to the Advisor with respect to the first three calendar quarters of such previous
12-month period; provided, however, that no incentive fee is payable with respect to any calendar quarter unless AFFO is greater
than zero for the four most recently completed calendar quarters, or the number of completed calendar quarters since the closing
date of the offering, whichever is less. For purposes of calculating the incentive fee during the first 12 months after completion
of the offering, AFFO will be determined by annualizing the applicable period following completion of the offering. 

AFFO is calculated
by adjusting the Company s funds from operations, or FFO, by adding back acquisition and disposition costs, stock based
compensation expenses, amortization of deferred financing costs and any other non-recurring or non-cash expenses, which are costs
that do not relate to the operating performance of the Company s properties, and subtracting loss on extinguishment of debt,
straight line rent adjustment, recurring tenant improvements, recurring leasing commissions and recurring capital expenditures.

Note 7 - 2016 Equity Incentive Plan

LTIP Units and Related Accounting Impact  

Prior to the completion
of the initial public offering on July 1, 2016, the Company s board of directors approved and adopted the 2016 Equity Incentive
Plan. The purpose of the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan is to attract and retain qualified persons upon whom, in large measure, our
sustained progress, growth and profitability depend, to motivate the participants to achieve long-term company goals and to more
closely align the participants  interests with those of the Company s other stockholders by providing them with a
proprietary interest in the Company s growth and performance. The Company s executive officers, employees, employees
of our advisor and its affiliates, consultants and non-employee directors are eligible to participate in the 2016 Equity Incentive
Plan. Under the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, a number of shares of the Company s common stock equal to 7 percent of the outstanding
shares of our common stock on a fully diluted basis upon the completion of the initial public offering (including 7 percent of
the shares sold pursuant to the underwriters  option), are available for issuance pursuant to awards under the 2016 Equity
Incentive Plan, less the shares underlying the LTIP grants awarded upon completion of the initial public offering. 

Specifically, an aggregate
of 358,250 LTIP units were granted upon completion of the offering on July 1, 2016 pursuant to the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan.
In addition, an aggregate of 874,147 additional shares are available for future issuance under the Company s 2016 Equity
Incentive Plan, or 7 percent of the fully diluted outstanding shares of the Company s common stock upon completion of the
initial public offering, including the underwriters  over-allotment option, which was exercised in full on July 11, 2016. 

-  20  - 

Of the 358,250 LTIP
units that were granted, 60,400 of the units vested immediately upon completion of the Company s initial public offering
on July 1, 2016 (the  IPO Units ). The remaining 297,850 LTIP units (the  Service LTIPs ) consist of 284,100
units granted to employees of the Advisor and its affiliates deemed to be non-employees in accordance with ASC Topic 505 and vest
over a period of 42 to 54 months as well as 13,750 units granted to the Company s independent directors that were deemed
to be employees in accordance with ASC Topic 718 and vest over a period of 12 months. The Service LTIPs vest and are expensed
ratably as service is performed over the periods described above using the straight-line method, subject to certain terms and
conditions. 

Total compensation
expense of $830,827 related to all of the Company s LTIP units was recorded for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and was classified as  General and Administrative  expense in the Company s accompanying Consolidated
Statements of Operations. Total compensation expense recognized is comprised of a charge of $604,000 on the IPO Units, calculated
based on a share price of $10.00 per unit, the closing share price for the Company s common stock at the closing date of
the initial public offering on July 1, 2016 and compensation expense of $226,827 incurred on of 23,056 Service LTIP using the
straight-line method. The compensation expense incurred related to the Service LTIPs granted to independent directors that were
deemed to be employees was based on a price of $10.00 per unit, the closing share price for the Company s common stock on
the closing date of the initial public offering on July 1, 2016. The compensation expense incurred related to the Service LTIPs
granted to employees of the Advisor and its affiliates deemed to be non-employees was based on a share price of $9.76 per unit,
the closing share price for the Company s common stock on September 30, 2016. The Service LTIPs granted to non-employees
are revalued each period at their then-current fair value at the end of that period, with a final measurement at the date of vesting. 

There was a total
of 274,794 LTIP units that no compensation expense has been incurred on as of September 30, 2016. Total unamortized compensation
expense related to these units of approximately $2.7 million is expected to be recognized subsequent to September 30, 2016 over
a weighted average remaining period of 3.30 years. All LTIP units provide for the payment of dividends at the same time dividends
are paid to holders of the Company s common stock. 

Shares subject to
awards under the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan that are forfeited, cancelled, lapsed, settled in cash or otherwise expired (excluding
shares withheld to satisfy exercise prices or tax withholding obligations) will again be available for awards under the 2016 Equity
Incentive Plan. The 2016 Equity Incentive Plan is administered by the Company s compensation committee, which will interpret
the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan and have broad discretion to select the eligible persons to whom awards will be granted, as well
as the type, size and terms and conditions of each award, including the exercise price of options, the number of shares subject
to awards and the expiration date of, and the vesting schedule or other restrictions (including, without limitation, restrictive
covenants) applicable to, awards. 

The 2016
Equity Incentive Plan allows the Company to grant the following types of awards: 

options,
                                         including non-qualified options and incentive stock options;

Operating Partnership and LTIP Units  

As disclosed on March
14, 2016, the Company entered into the Agreement of Limited Partnership of Global Medical REIT, L.P. ( Partnership Agreement ),
pursuant to which the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, serves as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership
and may not be removed as general partner by the limited partners with or without cause. 

The Partnership Agreement,
as amended, provides, among other things, that the Operating Partnership initially has two classes of limited partnership interests,
which are Units of limited partnership interest ( OP Units ), and the Operating Partnership s LTIP units. In
calculating the percentage interests of the partners in the Operating Partnership, LTIP units are treated as OP Units. In general,
LTIP units will receive the same per-unit distributions as the OP Units. Initially, each LTIP unit will have a capital account
balance of zero and, therefore, will not have full parity with OP Units with respect to any liquidating distributions. However,
the Partnership Agreement, as amended provides that  book gain,  or economic appreciation, in the Company s
assets realized by the Operating Partnership as a result of the actual sale of all or substantially all of the Operating Partnership s
assets, or the revaluation of the Operating Partnership s assets as provided by applicable U.S. Department of Treasury regulations,
will be allocated first to the holders of LTIP units until their capital account per unit is equal to the average capital account
per-unit of the Company s OP Unit holders in the Operating Partnership. We expect that the Operating Partnership will issue
OP Units to limited partners, and the Company, in exchange for capital contributions of cash or property, and will issue LTIP
units pursuant to the Company s 2016 Equity Incentive Plan to persons who provide services to the Company, including the
Company s officers, directors and employees. 

-  21  - 

Pursuant to the Partnership
Agreement, as amended, any holders of OP Units, other than the Company or its subsidiaries, will receive redemption rights which,
subject to certain restrictions and limitations, will enable them to cause the Operating Partnership to redeem their OP Units
in exchange for cash or, at the Company s option, shares of the Company s common stock, on a one-for-one basis. The
Company has agreed to file, not earlier than one year after the closing of the IPO, one or more registration statements registering
the issuance or resale of shares of its common stock issuable upon redemption of the OP Units, including those issued upon conversion
of LTIP units to the Manager and the Former Advisor. 

LTIP units
are convertible into OP Units on a one for one basis, subject to certain conditions as set forth in the LTIP Unit Vesting Agreement
entered into by each LTIP unit holder. First, the LTIP units must have vested. The existing LTIP Unit Vesting Agreements generally
provide for a five-year vesting period. Second, the number of vested LTIP units that may be converted into OP Units is limited
to the proportion of the  capital account equivalency  that the LTIP units have achieved with the OP Units. The number
of vested LTIP units that may be converted generally is equal to the capital account balance of such LTIP units divided by the
capital account balance per unit of the OP units held by the General Partner. LTIP unit holders initially receive a capital account
with a zero balance and receive priority allocations of certain gains to increase their capital account balances until they equal
the capital account balances of OP Unit holders. Upon capital account equalization and vesting, LTIP units are convertible into
an equal number of OP Units at the holder s election with notice to the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership,
at any time at the election of the General Partner, may also force a conversion of vested LTIP units into OP Units, subject to
the capital account equivalency requirement described in this paragraph. 

LTIP unit
holders have the same voting rights as holders of OP Units, with the LTIP units voting as a single class with the OP Units and
having one vote per LTIP unit. With certain exceptions, a majority vote of the LTIP unit holders is required to amend the provisions
of the Partnership Agreement related to LTIP units. 

Note 8   Rental Revenue 

The aggregate annual
minimum cash to be received by the Company on the noncancelable operating leases related to its portfolio of facilities in effect

facilities constituted approximately 18% of rental revenue, the Plano facility constituted approximately 17% of rental revenue,
the West Mifflin facility constituted approximately 11% of rental revenue, the Melbourne facility constituted approximately 15%
of rental revenue, and the Reading facility constituted approximately 8% of rental revenue. The Asheville and Westland facilities
constituted approximately 3% and 6% of rental revenue, respectively. Based on their dates of acquisition the East Orange and Watertown
facilities constituted less than one percent of rental revenue. 

For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Omaha facility constituted approximately 26% of the Company s rental revenue, the Tennessee
facilities constituted approximately 21% of rental revenue, the Plano facility constituted approximately 17% of rental revenue,

For the three months
ended September 30, 2015, the Omaha facility constituted approximately 85% of the Company s rental revenue, the Asheville
facility constituted approximately 12% of rental revenue, and the West Mifflin facility constituted approximately 3% of rental

ended September 30, 2015, the Omaha facility constituted approximately 87% of the Company s rental revenue, the Asheville
facility constituted approximately 12% of rental revenue, and the West Mifflin facility constituted approximately 1% of rental
revenue. 

Note 9   Omaha Land Lease Rent Expense  

The Omaha facility
land lease initially was to expire in 2023 with options to renew up to 60 years. However, the Company exercised two five-year
lease renewal options and therefore the land lease currently expires in 2033, subject to future renewal options by the Company.
Under the terms of the land lease, annual rents increase 12.5% every fifth anniversary of the lease. The initial land lease increase
will occur in April 2017. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company expensed $18,153 and $54,461,
respectively related to this lease. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company expensed $46,768 and
$61,738, respectively related to this lease.

The aggregate minimum
cash payments to be made by the Company on the non-cancelable Omaha facility related land lease in effect as of September 30,
2016, are as follows for the subsequent years ended December 31; as listed below. 

Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies  

Litigation  

The Company is not
presently subject to any material litigation nor, to its knowledge, is any material litigation threatened against the Company,
which if determined unfavorably to the Company, would have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position,
results of operations, or cash flows. 

Environmental Matters  

The Company follows
a policy of monitoring its properties for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. While there can be no assurance that
a material environmental liability does not exist at its properties, the Company is not currently aware of any environmental liability
with respect to its properties that would have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
Additionally, the Company is not aware of any material environmental liability or any unasserted claim or assessment with respect
to an environmental liability that management believes would require additional disclosure or the recording of a loss contingency.

Overview  

Global Medical REIT
Inc. (the  Company,   us,   we,   our ) was incorporated in the state of Nevada
on March 18, 2011 and re-domiciled into a Maryland corporation, effective January 6, 2014. Our principal investment strategy is
to develop and manage a portfolio of real estate assets in the healthcare industry, which includes surgery centers, specialty
hospitals, and outpatient treatment centers. 

We formed our Operating
Partnership in March 2016 and have contributed all of our healthcare facilities to the Operating Partnership in exchange for common
units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. We intend to conduct all future acquisition activity and operations
through our Operating Partnership. We own Global Medical REIT GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which is the sole
general partner of our Operating Partnership. 

Recent Developments  

Initial Public Offering   

On June 28, 2016,
the Company, the Advisor, and the Operating Partnership entered into an Underwriting Agreement with Wunderlich Securities, Inc.,
as representative of the several underwriters named therein, relating to the offer and sale of the Company s common stock
in its initial public offering. As disclosed on July 1, 2016, the Company closed its initial public offering and issued 13,043,479
shares of its common stock at a price of $10.00 per share resulting in gross proceeds of $130,434,790. After deducting amounts
that the Company paid in costs that were directly attributable to the offering, underwriting discounts, advisory fees, and commissions,
for a total of $11,272,068, the Company received net proceeds from the offering of $119,162,722. Additionally, on July 11, 2016,
the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full, resulting in the issuance by the Company of an additional 1,956,521
shares of the Company s common stock at a price of $10.00 per share for gross proceeds of $19,565,210. After deducting underwriting
discounts, advisory fees, and commissions of $1,369,565, the Company received net proceeds from the over-allotment option shares
of $18,195,645. Transaction costs incurred in connection with the offering were approximately $1,681,259. Total shares issued
by the Company in the initial public offering, including over-allotment option shares, were 15,000,000 and the total net proceeds
received were $137,358,367. 

In connection with
the Company s initial public offering, the Company s common stock was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under
the ticker symbol  GMRE.  

Amended Management Agreement   

Upon completion of
the Company s initial public offering on July 1, 2016, the Company and the Advisor entered into an amended and restated
management agreement, pursuant to which the Advisor manages the operations and investment activities of the Company. 

2016 Equity Incentive Plan    

Prior to the completion
of the initial public offering on July 1, 2016, our board of directors approved and adopted the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan. The
purposes of the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan will be to attract and retain qualified persons upon whom, in large measure, our sustained
progress, growth and profitability depend, to motivate the participants to achieve long-term company goals and to more closely
align the participants  interests with those of our other stockholders by providing them with a proprietary interest in
our growth and performance. An aggregate of 358,250 LTIP units and restricted shares of our common stock were granted upon completion
of the offering on July 1, 2016 pursuant to the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan. In addition, we expect that an aggregate of 874,147
additional shares will be available for future issuance under our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, or 7% of the fully diluted outstanding
shares of our common stock upon completion of the initial public offering, including the underwriters  over-allotment option,
which was exercised in full on July 11, 2016.

the Company closed on an asset purchase agreement with Brown Investment Group, LLC, a South Dakota limited liability company,
to acquire a 30,062 square foot clinic and a 3,136 square foot administration building located at 506 1 st  Avenue SE,

Trends Which May Influence Results
of Operations  

We believe the following
trends in the healthcare real estate market positively affect the acquisition, ownership, development and management of healthcare
real estate: 

growing
healthcare expenditures;  

an
aging population;  

a
continuing shift towards outpatient care;  

implementation
of the Affordable Care Act;  

physician
practice group and hospital consolidation;  

healthcare
industry employment growth;  

expected
monetization and modernization of healthcare real estate;  

a
highly fragmented healthcare real estate market; and  

a
limited new supply of healthcare real estate.  

Components of the Company s Revenues,
Expenses and Cash Flows  

Revenue   

Rental revenue  

Our operations currently
consist of rental revenue earned from our tenant-operators under leasing arrangements which provide for minimum rent, escalations,
and charges to the tenant-operator for the real estate taxes and operating expenses. The leases have been accounted for as operating
leases. For operating leases with contingent rental escalators, revenue is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments
due during the period. Revenue from leases with fixed annual rental escalators are recognized on a straight-line basis over the
initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. If we determine that collectability of rents is not reasonably assured,
future revenue recognition is limited to amounts contractually owed and paid, and, when appropriate, an allowance for estimated
losses is established. 

Other income  

Other income consists
primarily of interest income earned on the net proceeds received from our initial public offering. 

Expenses   

Acquisition fees
  related party  

Acquisition fees represented
an expense incurred for a fee paid by us to the Advisor for each acquisition in connection with the terms of the original management
agreement. In accordance with the provisions of the amended and restated management agreement, which became effective July 1,
2016, acquisition fees are no longer charged to the Company by the Advisor. 

General and administrative  

General and administrative
expense primarily includes professional fees and services (legal and accounting), general office expenses, ground rent related
to the Omaha facility, and travel and related expenses. 

Management fees
  related party  

In accordance with
the terms of the Company s initial management agreement between us and the Advisor, we owed the Advisor a base management
fee equal to the greater of (a) 2.0% per annum of our net asset value (the value of our assets less the value of our liabilities),
or (b) $30,000 per calendar month. Historically this fee has resulted in a monthly charge to us of $30,000. Upon completion of
the Company s initial public offering on July 1, 2016, the Company s amended and restated management agreement, which
was approved by the Company s board of directors on June 13, 2016, became effective. Refer to Note 6    Related
Party Transactions  for details regarding the amended and restated management agreement, the management fee expense incurred
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and accrued management fees owed to the Advisor as of September 30, 2016. 

-  27  - 

Depreciation expense  

Depreciation expense
is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements, which are generally
between 5 and 40 years. 

Interest expense  

Interest expense is
derived from interest incurred on our borrowings from third party institutional lenders as well as borrowings from related parties,
the funds of which were primarily used to fund acquisitions. Additionally, the amortization of deferred financing costs (debt
discount) incurred to obtain third party financing is classified as interest expense. 

Cash Flow   

Cash flows from
operating activities  

Cash flows from operating
activities primarily represent activities related to us conducting our normal business activities and generally reflect the impact
of transactions that enter into the determination of our net income or loss. 

Cash flows from
investing activities  

Cash flows from investing
activities primarily represent activities related to us acquiring healthcare facilities, plants, and equipment and making and
collecting loans from other entities. 

Cash flows from
financing activities  

Cash flows from financing
activities primarily represent activities related to us borrowing and subsequently repaying funds from other entities as well
as providing stockholders with a return on investment primarily in the form of a dividend payment. 

Competition  

Our healthcare facilities
often face competition from nearby hospitals and other healthcare facilities that provide comparable services. Similarly, our
tenant-operators face competition from other medical practices and service providers at nearby hospitals and other healthcare
facilities. From time to time and for reasons beyond our control, managed-care organizations may change their lists of preferred
hospitals or in-network physicians. Physicians also may change hospital affiliations. If competitors of our tenant-operators or
competitors of the associated healthcare delivery systems with which our healthcare facilities are strategically aligned have
greater geographic coverage, improve access and convenience to physicians and patients, provide or are perceived to provide higher
quality services, recruit physicians to provide competing services at their facilities, expand or improve their services or obtain
more favorable managed-care contracts, our tenant-operators may not be able to successfully compete. Any reduction in rental revenues
resulting from the inability of our tenant-operators or the associated healthcare delivery systems with which our healthcare facilities
are strategically aligned to compete in providing medical services and/or receiving sufficient rates of reimbursement for healthcare
services rendered may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability
to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common stock. 

Qualification
as a REIT  

Our business strategy
is conducive to a more favorable tax structure whereby we may qualify and elect to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. We plan to elect to be taxed as REIT under U.S. federal income tax laws commencing with our contemplated taxable
year ending December 31, 2016. We believe that, commencing with 2016, we have organized and have operated in such a manner
as to qualify for taxation as a REIT under all of the U.S. federal income tax laws, and we intend to continue to operate in such
a manner. However, we cannot provide assurances that we will operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT. 

In order to qualify
as a REIT, a substantial percentage of our assets must be qualifying real estate assets and a substantial percentage of our income
must be rental revenue from real property or interest on mortgage loans. We must elect under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (the
 Code ) to be treated as a REIT. Subject to a number of significant exceptions, a corporation that qualifies as a
REIT generally is not subject to U.S. federal corporate income taxes on income and gains that it distributes to its stockholders,
thereby reducing its corporate level taxes.

Critical Accounting
Policies  

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies,
including making estimates and assumptions. We base estimates on the best information available to us at the time, our experience
and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances
relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been
applied, resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we re-evaluate our estimates and
assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent
periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. For a more detailed discussion
of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  in the
footnotes to the accompanying financial statements. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider to be the most
critical to understanding complex judgments involved and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations, financial
condition and cash flows. 

Use of Estimates   

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Purchase of Real Estate    

Transactions in which
real estate assets are purchased that are not subject to an existing significant lease or are attached or related to a major healthcare
provider are treated as asset acquisitions, and as such are recorded at their purchase price, including acquisition fees, which
is allocated to land and building based upon their relative fair values at the date of acquisition. Investment properties that
are acquired either subject to a significant existing lease or as part of a portfolio level transaction with significant leasing
activity are treated as a business combination under Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 805,  Business
Combinations,  which requires the purchase price of acquired properties be allocated to the acquired tangible assets and
liabilities, consisting of land, building, and any identified intangible assets. Acquisition fees are expensed as incurred. Fair
value is determined based on ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,  primarily based on unobservable
data inputs. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating the purchase price of individually acquired properties,
we utilize our own market knowledge and published market data. In this regard, we also utilize information obtained from county
tax assessment records to assist in the determination of the fair value of the land and building. We utilize market comparable
transactions such as price per square foot to assist in the determination of fair value for purposes of allocating the purchase
price of properties acquired as part of portfolio level transactions.   The value of acquired leases, if applicable,
is estimated based upon the costs we would have incurred to lease the property under similar terms. 

Impairment of Long Lived assets

We evaluate our real
estate assets for impairment periodically or whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.
If an impairment indicator exists, we compare the expected future undiscounted cash flows against the carrying amount of an asset.
If the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, we record an impairment loss
for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amount of the asset. 

Revenue Recognition   

Our operations currently
consist of rental revenue earned from tenants under leasing arrangements which provide for minimum rent, escalations, and charges
to the tenant for the real estate taxes and operating expenses. The leases have been accounted for as operating leases. For operating
leases with contingent rental escalators, revenue is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due during the period.
Revenue from leases with fixed annual rental escalators are recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease term, subject
to a collectability assessment. If we determine that collectability of rents is not reasonably assured, future revenue recognition
is limited to amounts contractually owed and paid, and, when appropriate, an allowance for estimated losses is established. 

We consistently assess
the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts, including an allowance for operating lease straight-line rent receivables, for
estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults, or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments.
We also monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on a continuous basis. This evaluation considers
industry and economic conditions, property performance, credit enhancements and other factors. For operating lease straight-line
rent amounts, our assessment is based on amounts estimated to be recoverable over the term of the lease. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Fair value is a market-based
measurement and should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants may use in pricing an asset or liability.
In accordance with ASC Topic 820, the valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset
or liability as of the measurement date. A financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based
upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels are defined as follows: 

-  29  - 

Level 1-Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets; 

Level 2-Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs
that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial
instrument; and 

Level 3-Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. 

We consider the carrying
values of cash and cash equivalents, escrow deposits, accounts and other receivables, and accounts payable and accrued expenses
to approximate the fair value for these financial instruments because of the short period of time since origination or the short
period of time between origination of the instruments and their expected realization. Due to the short-term nature of these instruments,
Level 1 and Level 2 inputs are utilized to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments. 

Stock-Based Compensation  

The Company expenses
the fair value of unit awards in accordance with the fair value recognition requirements of ASC Topic 718,  Compensation-Stock
Compensation  and ASC Topic 505,  Equity.  These ASC topics require companies to measure the cost of the recipient
services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Under ASC
Topic 718, the Company s independent directors are deemed to be employees and therefore compensation expense for these units
is recognized based on the price of $10.00 per unit, the closing share price for the Company s common stock at the closing
date of the initial public offering on July 1, 2016, ratably over the 12-month service period, using the straight line method.
Under ASC Topic 505, the employees of the Advisor and its affiliates are deemed to be non-employees of the Company and therefore
compensation expense for these units is recognized using the share price of the Company s common stock at the end of the
reporting period, ratably over the 42-month or 54-month service period, respectively, depending on the grant terms, using the
straight line method. 

Consolidated Results of Operations  

The major factor that
resulted in variances in our results of operations for each revenue and expense category for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 is due to the fact that as of September 30, 2016 our portfolio
consisted of facilities from a total of ten acquisitions, whereas as of September 30, 2015 only three of the ten acquisitions
had occurred. 

As of September 30,
2016 the Company had facilities in its portfolio from the following acquisitions: 

As of September 30,
2015 the Company had facilities in its portfolio from the following acquisitions: 

Revenue   

Total revenue for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $2,002,650, compared to $487,102 for the same period in 2015, an increase of $1,515,548.
The increase is the result of rental revenue derived from the base rental receipts from the additional facilities that we acquired
and were included as part of our portfolio during the current three-month period. The corresponding period during 2015 included
only the results from the Omaha and Asheville facilities for the full three-month period and six days of results from the West
Mifflin facility. Additionally, the  other income  component of total revenue increased during the current period
primarily as a result of interest earned on the net proceeds received from the initial public offering. 

-  30  - 

Total revenue for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $5,087,368, compared to $1,405,140 for the same period in 2015, an increase of $3,682,228.
The increase is the result of rental revenue derived from the base rental receipts from the additional facilities that we acquired
and were included as part of our portfolio during the current nine-month period. The corresponding period during 2015 included
only the results from the Omaha and Asheville facilities for the full nine-month period and six days of results from the West
Mifflin facility. Additionally, the  other income  component of total revenue increased during the current period
primarily as a result of interest earned on the net proceeds received from the initial public offering. 

Acquisition Fees   related
party   

No acquisition fees
were incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a $227,000 acquisition fee that was incurred for the
same period in 2015 related to the acquisition of the West Mifflin facility. The acquisition fee was computed as 2% of the purchase
price of the facility. Under the amended and restated management agreement between the Company and the Advisor, which became effective
on July 1, 2016, the Company is no longer required to pay acquisition fees, and therefore the acquisitions of the Reading,
East Orange, and Watertown facilities that occurred during the current quarter did not incur an acquisition fee. 

Acquisition fees for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $754,000, compared to $227,000 for the same period in 2015, an increase of $527,000.
The $754,000 of current nine-month period acquisition fees consisted of $350,000, $309,000 and $95,000 that were expensed in connection
with the current first quarter acquisitions of the Plano, Melbourne, and Westland Facilities, respectively. The $227,000 acquisition
fee that was incurred in the 2015 period related to the acquisition of the West Mifflin facility. Under the amended and restated
management agreement between the Company and the Advisor, which became effective on July 1, 2016, the acquisitions of the
Reading, East Orange, and Watertown facilities that occurred during the current quarter did not incur an acquisition fee. 

General and Administrative   

General and administrative
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,721,676, compared to $150,810 for the same period in 2015, an increase
of $1,570,866. The increase results from non-cash compensation expense of $830,827 incurred related to the LTIP units that were
granted on July 1, 2016, as well as from increases in accounting and compliance costs associated with audit requirements related
to the acquired properties and a general increase in this expense category (insurance, legal, business development) as a result
of the additional facilities that we acquired subsequent to the corresponding period in 2015 and were included as part of our
portfolio during the current three-month period. 

General and administrative
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $2,978,415, compared to $291,591 for the same period in 2015, an increase
of $2,686,824. The increase results from non-cash compensation expense of $830,827 incurred related to the LTIP units that were
granted on July 1, 2016, a $500,000 development fee incurred in connection with the Plano acquisition, as well as from increases
in accounting and compliance costs associated with audit requirements related to the acquired properties and a general increase
in this expense category (insurance, legal, business development) as a result of the additional facilities that we acquired subsequent
to the corresponding period in 2015 and were included as part of our portfolio during the current nine-month period. 

Management Fees   related
party   

Management fees for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $627,147, compared to $90,000 for the same period in 2015, an increase of $537,147.
The current period management fee was calculated based upon the terms of the amended and restated management agreement which became
effective on July 1, 2016. The management fee for the corresponding period in 2015 was calculated based on the terms of the original
management agreement that was effective since April 1, 2014. The increase in management fees is attributable to the increase in
stockholders  equity resulting from the initial public offering. 

Management fees for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $807,147, compared to $270,000 for the same period in 2015, an increase of $537,147.
The current nine-month management fee was calculated based upon the terms of the amended and restated management agreement from
July 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016 ($627,147 of expense) and was calculated based on the terms of the original management
agreement from January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016 ($180,000 of expense). The management fee for the corresponding period in
2015 was calculated based on the terms of the original management agreement that was effective since April 1, 2014.

Depreciation Expense   

Depreciation expense
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $585,449, compared to $153,148 for the same period in 2015, an increase of $432,301.
The increase is a result of depreciation expense incurred related to the additional facilities that we acquired and were included
as part of our portfolio during the current three-month period. 

Depreciation expense
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,528,281, compared to $446,491 for the same period in 2015, an increase of
$1,081,790. The increase is a result of depreciation expense incurred related to the additional facilities that we acquired and
were included as part of our portfolio during the current nine-month period. 

Interest Expense   

Interest expense for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,051,204, compared to $363,937 for the same period in 2015, an increase of $687,267.
The increase results from an early termination fee of $301,200 that was incurred related to the early pay-off of the Omaha facility
debt which is recorded as interest expense as well as from an increase in interest expense incurred on the additional third party
debt and borrowings from our related parties that we procured related to facilities that we acquired subsequent to the corresponding
period in 2015. The increase also results from debt discount amortization related to the additional deferred financing costs (recorded
as interest expense) incurred on the debt we procured. 

Interest expense for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $3,443,113, compared to $988,825 for the same period in 2015, an increase of $2,454,288.
The increase results from an early termination fee of $301,200 that was incurred related to the early pay-off of the Omaha facility
debt which is recorded as interest expense as well as from an increase in interest expense incurred on the additional third party
debt and borrowings from our related parties that we procured related to facilities that we acquired subsequent to the corresponding
period in 2015. The increase also results from debt discount amortization related to the additional deferred financing costs (recorded
as interest expense) incurred on the debt we procured. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

General   

We believe that our
initial public offering strengthened our financial position by allowing us to reduce our leverage and increasing our stockholders 
equity and available cash. Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds to pay for operating expenses and
other expenditures directly associated with our properties, including: 

property expenses,   

interest expense and scheduled
                                         principal payments on outstanding indebtedness,   

general and administrative expenses,
                                         and acquisition expenses.   

In addition, we will
require funds for future distributions expected to be paid to our common stockholders and OP unit holders in our operating partnership
following completion of the initial public offering. 

We expect to satisfy
our short-term liquidity requirements through our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operating activities, the
proceeds of the initial public offering, and future borrowings under any other debt instruments we may enter into. 

Our long-term liquidity
needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for acquisitions, recurring and non-recurring capital expenditures, scheduled
debt maturities and general and administrative expenses. We expect to satisfy our long-term liquidity needs through cash flow
from operations, long-term secured and unsecured borrowings, sales of additional equity securities, and, in connection with acquisitions
of additional properties, the issuance of OP units of our operating partnership, and proceeds from select property dispositions
and joint venture transactions. 

We intend to invest
in additional properties as suitable opportunities arise and adequate sources of financing are available. We currently are evaluating
additional potential acquisitions consistent with the normal course of our business. There can be no assurance as to whether or
when any portion of these acquisitions will be completed. Our ability to complete acquisitions is subject to a number of risks
and variables, including our ability to negotiate mutually agreeable terms with sellers and our ability to finance the acquisitions.
We may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions, which may impede our growth and negatively affect
our results of operations and may result in the use of a significant amount of management resources. We expect that future acquisitions
of properties will depend on and will be financed, in whole or in part, by our existing cash, borrowings, including under any
potential senior secured credit facility that we may enter into or the proceeds from additional issuances and sales of common
stock, issuances and sales of preferred stock, issuances of OP units or the issuance and sale of other securities. 

We currently do not
expect to sell any of our properties to meet our liquidity needs, although we may do so in the future.

To qualify as a REIT
for federal income tax purposes, we are required to distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, without regard
to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and to pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that
we annually distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income. Subject to the requirements of the Maryland General Corporation
Law we intend to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders, if and to the extent authorized by our Board of Directors. 

Indebtedness   

Our facilities have
been financed through a combination of third-party debt and funding received from ZH USA, LLC. A detail of our notes payable balances
from third-party lenders, net of unamortized debt discount, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is as follows: 

We have also received
funds from ZH USA, LLC in the form of convertible interest bearing notes (8% per annum, payable in arrears) due on demand unsecured
debt. We may prepay the note at any time, in whole or in part. ZH USA, LLC may elect to convert all or a portion of the outstanding
principal amount of the note into shares of common stock in an amount equal to the principal amount of the note, together with
accrued but unpaid interest, divided by $12.748. On March 2, 2016, ZH USA, LLC converted $15,000,000 of principal under the Convertible
Debenture into 1,176,656 shares of the Company s then unregistered common stock based on a conversion rate of $12.748 per
share. 

On June 15, 2016,
in anticipation of its initial public offering, the Company entered into a Pay-Off Letter and Conversion Agreement (the  Pay-Off
Letter and Conversion Agreement ) with ZH USA, LLC with regards to the Convertible Debentures loaned to the Company. Under
the terms of the Pay-Off Letter and Conversion Agreement, upon the closing date of the initial public offering on July 1, 2016,
the Company converted the remaining principal amount of $15,030,134 into 1,179,019 shares of the Company s common stock
based on a conversion rate of $12.748 per share. Additionally, in accordance with the Pay-Off Letter and Conversion Agreement,
on July 8, 2016 the Company paid off the remaining principal amount of $10,000,000 outstanding under the Convertible Debentures
and all accrued interest owed on the Convertible Debentures in the amount of $1,716,811 with a total payment of $11,716,811. 

A rollforward of the
funding from ZH USA, LLC as of September 30, 2016 is as follows:  

Cash Flow Information   

Net cash used in operating
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $2,059,800, compared with $80,165 used in operating activities for
the same period in 2015. The increase during the current nine-month period was primarily derived from increases in the net loss
and net cash used in operating activities resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The net cash used in operating
activities was partially offset by increases in non-cash expenses such as LTIP compensation expense, depreciation expense and
amortization of debt discount expense. 

Net cash used in investing
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $68,335,185, compared with $11,680,355 used in investing activities
for the same period in 2015. The increase during the current nine-month period was primarily derived from the completed acquisitions
of six facilities during the period. Cash flows used in investing activities are heavily dependent upon the investment in properties
and real estate assets. We anticipate cash flows used in investing activities to increase as we acquire additional properties
in the future. 

Net cash provided
by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $142,558,707, compared with $11,760,534 provided by operating
activities for the same period in 2015. The increase during the current nine-month period was primarily derived from the net proceeds
received from the initial public offering of $137,358,367 and proceeds of $32,097,400 received from the Cantor loan, partially
offset by the repayment of the Omaha third party debt in full, a partial payment of the remaining Convertible Debenture balance,
and payments of deferred financing costs, deferred public offering costs, and dividends.

Dividends   

Pursuant to a previously
declared dividend approved by the Board of Directors of the Company and in compliance with applicable provisions of the Maryland
General Corporation Law, the Company has paid a monthly dividend of $0.0852 per share each month during the four-month period
from January 2016 through April 2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company paid total dividends to holders
of its common stock in the amount of $285,703. On September 14, 2016, the Company announced the declaration of a cash dividend
of $0.20 per share of common stock to stockholders of record as of September 27, 2016 and to the holders of the LTIP units that
were granted on July 1, 2016. This dividend, in the amount of $3,592,786, was accrued as of September 30, 2016 and paid on October
11, 2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company paid total dividends to holders of its common stock in
the amount of $170,400. Additionally, a dividend was declared on September 17, 2015 and paid in October 2015. The amount of that
dividend was $21,300. 

The amount of the
dividends paid to our stockholders is determined by our Board of Directors and is dependent on a number of factors, including
funds available for payment of dividends, our financial condition, capital expenditure requirements and annual dividend amount
of offering proceeds that may be used to fund dividends, except that, in accordance with our organizational documents and Maryland
law, we may not make dividend distributions that would: (i) cause us to be unable to pay our debts as they become due in the usual
course of business; (ii) cause our total assets to be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus senior liquidation preferences;
or (iii) jeopardize our ability to maintain our qualification as a REIT. 

Inflation   

Historically, inflation
has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our healthcare facilities. Many of our triple-net lease agreements contain
provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. These provisions include clauses that enable us to receive payment
of increased rent pursuant to escalation clauses which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases. These escalation
clauses often provide for fixed rent increases or indexed escalations (based upon the consumer price index or other measures).
However, some of these contractual rent increases may be less than the actual rate of inflation. Most of our triple-net lease
agreements require the tenant-operator to pay an allocable share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance costs,
real estate taxes and insurance. This requirement reduces our exposure to increases in these costs and operating expenses resulting
from inflation. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk.  

We are a smaller reporting
company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this Item

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures  

We maintain disclosure
controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted to the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms, and that information is accumulated and communicated
to management, including the principal executive and financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures. Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of disclosure controls
and procedures as of September 30, 2016 pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be included in our periodic SEC filings
is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. 

Our management, including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or
our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system
must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting  

No changes were made
to our internal control over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
