Note 1.  Organization     
  PacWest Bancorp is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. Our principal business is to serve as the holding company for our wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Pacific Western Bank.  References to "Pacific Western" or the "Bank" refer to Pacific Western Bank together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries.  References to  we,  "us,"  our,  or the  Company,  refer to PacWest Bancorp together with its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.  When we refer to  PacWest  or to the holding company, we are referring to PacWest Bancorp, the parent company, on a stand alone basis. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had total assets of   $21.3 billion  , gross loans and leases of   $14.8 billion  , total deposits of   $15.6 billion   and total stockholders' equity of   $4.5 billion  . 
  We are focused on relationship-based business banking to small, middle-market and venture-backed businesses nationwide. The Bank offers a broad range of loan and lease and deposit products and services through   79   full-service branches located throughout the State of California,   one   branch located in Durham, North Carolina, and several loan production offices located in cities across the country.  The Bank provides commercial banking services, including real estate, construction, and commercial loans and leases, and comprehensive deposit and treasury management services to small and middle-market businesses. Pacific Western offers additional products and services through its CapitalSource and Square 1 Bank divisions. CapitalSource provides cash flow, asset-based, equipment and real estate loans and treasury management services to established middle-market businesses on a national basis. Square 1 Bank offers a comprehensive suite of financial services focused on entrepreneurial businesses and their venture capital and private equity investors, with offices located in key innovation hubs across the United States.  In addition, we provide investment advisory and asset management services to select clients through Square 1 Asset Management, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank and a SEC-registered investment adviser. When we refer to "CapitalSource Inc." we are referring to the company acquired on   April 7, 2014   and when we refer to the "CapitalSource Division" we are referring to a division of Pacific Western.  
  We generate our revenue primarily from interest received on loans and leases and, to a lesser extent, from interest received on investment securities, and fees received in connection with deposit services, extending credit and other services offered, including foreign exchange services. Our major operating expenses are compensation, occupancy, general operating expenses, and the interest paid by the Bank on deposits and borrowings. 
  We have completed   28   acquisitions from May 1, 2000 through   September 30, 2016  , including the acquisition of   Square 1 Financial, Inc. ("Square 1")     on   October 6, 2015  . Our acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, the operating results of the acquired entities have been included in the consolidated financial statements from their respective acquisition dates. See Note 2.   Acquisitions  , for more information about the Square 1 acquisition. 
  On March 31, 2016, we sold our Pacific Western Equipment Finance ("PWEF") leasing unit in Midvale, Utah, including approximately   $139 million   of outstanding lease balances. 
  Significant Accounting Policies 
  Except as discussed below, our accounting policies are described in Note 1.   Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  , of our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("Form 10-K").  
  Basis of Presentation       
  Our interim consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, certain disclosures accompanying annual consolidated financial statements are omitted. In the opinion of management, all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated and adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring accruals and considered necessary for the fair presentation of financial statements for the interim periods, have been included. The current period's results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that ultimately may be achieved for the year. The interim consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Form 10-K.

Use of Estimates 
  We have made a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period to prepare these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP.  Material estimates subject to change in the near term include, among other items, the allowance for credit losses, the carrying value and useful lives of intangible assets, the realization of deferred tax assets, and the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions. These estimates may be adjusted as more current information becomes available, and any adjustment may be significant. 
  As described in Note 2.   Acquisitions,   the acquired assets and liabilities of Square 1 were measured at their estimated fair values. We made significant estimates and exercised significant judgment in estimating fair values and accounting for such acquired assets and assumed liabilities. 
  Reclassifications 
  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation format.  The operating segments previously reported have been aggregated into   one   segment to conform to the current period's presentation format. 
   
  Note 2.  Acquisitions     
    Square 1 Financial, Inc. Acquisition  
       We acquired Square 1 on     October 6, 2015  .  As part of the acquisition, Square 1 Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Square 1, merged with and into Pacific Western. At closing, we formed the Square 1 Ban  k Division of Pacific Western     to focus on providing a comprehensive suite of financial services to entrepreneurial businesses and their venture capital and private equity investors nationwide.   When we refer to "Square 1", we are referring to the company acquired on October 6, 2015, and when we refer to the "Square 1 Bank Division", we are referring to a   division of Pacif  ic Western. 
  We completed this acquisition to increase our core deposits, expand our nationwide lending platform, and increase our presence in the technology and life-sciences credit markets. The Square 1 acquisition has been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. We acquired   $4.6 billion   of assets and assumed   $3.8 billion   of liabilities upon closing of the acquisition. The assets and liabilities, both tangible and intangible, were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. We made significant estimates and exercised significant judgment in estimating fair values and accounting for such acquired assets and liabilities.  The application of the acquisition method of accounting resulted in goodwill of   $446.1 million  . All of the recognized goodwill is expected to be non-deductible for tax purposes.

Note 3.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
  Goodwill arises from the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations and represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets and other identifiable intangible assets acquired. Our intangible assets with definite lives are core deposit intangibles ("CDI") and customer relationship intangibles ("CRI"). 
  Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives generated from business combinations are not subject to amortization and are instead tested for impairment no less than annually. Impairment exists when the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. An impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess and would be included in  Noninterest expense  in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings. 
   CDI and CRI are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment at least quarterly. The amortization expense represents the estimated decline in the value of the underlying deposits or loan and lease customers acquired.  The weighted average amortization period remaining for all of our CDI and CRI as of   September 30, 2016   is   5.6   years. The aggregate CDI and CRI amortization expense is expected to be   $16.5 million   for   2016  . The estimated aggregate amortization expense related to these intangible assets for each of the next five years is   $11.5 million   for   2017  ,   $8.8 million   for   2018  ,   $6.7 million   for   2019  ,   $4.7 million   for   2020  , and   $3.0 million   for   2021  . 
   The following table presents the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the period indicated:     

Goodwill adjustments include the finalization of the acquired Square 1 net tax assets and the reduction of goodwill in connection with the sale of the PWEF leasing unit. The finalization of the day 1 fair value of the acquired tax assets is due to completion of the 2015 tax returns. Through the sale of the PWEF leasing unit on March 31, 2016,   $0.5 million   of goodwill was allocated to this business group; such goodwill reduction is included in the   $0.7 million   loss on sale of the PWEF leasing unit and included in "Other income" in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings. 
  The following table presents the changes in CDI and CRI and the related accumulated amortization for the periods indicated:

Note 4. Investment Securities      
  Securities Available-for-Sale  
  The following table presents amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, and carrying values of securities available-for-sale as of the dates indicated: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , securities available-for-sale with a carrying value of   $342.2 million   were pledged as collateral for borrowings, public deposits and other purposes as required by various statutes and agreements.  
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold   $39.1 million   of securities available-for-sale for a gross realized gain of   $1.0 million   and a gross realized loss of   $0.6 million  .  During the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , we sold   $52.0 million   of securities available-for-sale for a gross realized gain of   $0.7 million  .   
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we sold   $383.9 million   of securities available-for-sale for a gross realized gain of   $10.5 million   and a gross realized loss of   $1.6 million  .  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we sold   $208.4 million   of securities available-for-sale for a gross realized gain of   $4.4 million   and a gross realized loss of   $0.7 million  .

Unrealized Losses on Securities Available-for-Sale  
  The following tables present the gross unrealized losses and fair values of securities available-for-sale that were in unrealized loss positions, for which other-than-temporary impairments have not been recognized in earnings, as of the dates indicated:  

We reviewed the securities that were in a loss position at   September 30, 2016  , and concluded their unrealized losses were not a result of downgraded credit ratings or other indicators of deterioration of the underlying issuers' ability to repay. Such unrealized losses were a result of the level of market interest rates and pricing changes caused by shifting supply and demand dynamics relative to the types of securities. Accordingly, we determined the securities were temporarily impaired and we did not recognize such impairment in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings. Although we occasionally sell securities for portfolio management purposes, we do not foresee having to sell any temporarily impaired securities strictly for liquidity needs and believe that it is more likely than not we would not be required to sell any temporarily impaired securities before recovery of their amortized cost.

Contractual Maturities of Securities Available-for-Sale 
  The following table presents the contractual maturities of our securities available-for-sale portfolio based on amortized cost and carrying value as of the date indicated: 

Mortgage-backed securities have contractual terms to maturity but require periodic payments to reduce principal. In addition, expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because obligors and/or issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. 
  Interest Income on Investment Securities 
  The following table presents the composition of our interest income on investment securities for the periods indicated:

Note 5.  Loans and Leases 
  The Company s loan and lease portfolio includes originated and purchased loans and leases. Originated and purchased loans and leases for which there was no evidence of credit deterioration at their acquisition date and for which it was probable that all contractually required payments would be collected, are referred to collectively as non-purchased credit impaired loans, or "Non-PCI loans." Purchased loans for which there was, at the acquisition date, evidence of credit deterioration since their origination and for which it was deemed probable that we would be unable to collect all contractually required payments, are referred to as purchased credit impaired loans, or "PCI loans". 
  Non-PCI loans are carried at the principal amount outstanding, net of deferred fees and costs, and in the case of acquired loans, net of purchase discounts and premiums. Deferred fees and costs and purchase discounts and premiums are recognized as an adjustment to interest income over the contractual life of the loans using the effective interest method or taken into income on an accelerated basis when the related loans are paid off or sold.  
  PCI loans are accounted for in accordance with ASC Subtopic 310 30,    Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality"  . For PCI loans, at the time of acquisition we (i) calculate the contractual amount and timing of undiscounted principal and interest payments (the "undiscounted contractual cash flows") and (ii) estimate the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal and interest payments (the "undiscounted expected cash flows"). The difference between the undiscounted contractual cash flows and the undiscounted expected cash flows is the nonaccretable difference. The difference between the undiscounted cash flows expected to be collected and the estimated fair value of the acquired loans is the accretable yield. The nonaccretable difference represents an estimate of the loss exposure of principal and interest related to the PCI loan portfolio; such amount is subject to change over time based on the performance of such loans. The carrying value of PCI loans is reduced by payments received, both principal and interest, and increased by the portion of the accretable yield recognized as interest income.   
  The following table summarizes the composition of our loan and lease portfolio as of the dates indicated:

It is the Company's policy to discontinue accruing interest when, in the opinion of management, there is a reasonable doubt as to the collectability of a loan or lease in the normal course of business or when principal or interest payments are past due 90 days or more unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. Interest income on nonaccrual loans is recognized only to the extent cash is received and the principal balance of the loan is deemed collectable. 
  The following table presents our nonaccrual and performing Non PCI loans and leases by portfolio segment and class as of the dates indicated:     

At   September 30, 2016  , nonaccrual loans and leases totaled   $171.1 million   and included   $11.9 million   of loans and leases 90 or more days past due,   $13.2 million   of loans and leases 30 to 89 days past due, and   $146.0 million   of loans and leases current with respect to contractual payments that were placed on nonaccrual status based on management s judgment regarding their collectability. Nonaccrual loans and leases totaled   $129.0 million   at   December 31, 2015  , including   $16.8 million   of  the loans and leases 90 or more days past due,   $3.6 million   of loans and leases 30 to 89 days past due, and   $108.6 million   of current loans and leases that were placed on nonaccrual status based on management s judgment regarding their collectability.

The following table presents the credit risk rating categories for Non PCI loans and leases by portfolio segment and class as of the dates indicated. Nonclassified loans and leases are those with a credit risk rating of either pass or special mention, while classified loans and leases are those with a credit risk rating of either substandard or doubtful. 

In addition to our internal risk rating process, our federal and state banking regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company s loan and lease risk rating classifications. Our regulators may require the Company to recognize rating downgrades based on their judgments related to information available to them at the time of their examinations. Risk rating downgrades generally result in higher allowances for credit losses. 
  Non PCI nonaccrual loans and leases and performing troubled debt restructured loans are considered impaired for reporting purposes. The following table presents the composition of our impaired loans and leases as of the dates indicated:

Note 7. Borrowings and Subordinated Debentures 
  Borrowings 
  The following table summarizes our borrowings as of the dates indicated: 

The non recourse debt represents the payment stream of certain equipment leases sold to third parties. The debt is secured by the leased equipment and all interest rates are fixed. As of   September 30, 2016  , this debt had a weighted average remaining maturity of   2.0   years. 
  The Bank has established secured and unsecured lines of credit under which it may borrow funds from time to time on a term or overnight basis from the FHLB, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco ( FRBSF ), and other financial institutions. 
  FHLB Secured Lines of Credit.   The borrowing arrangement with the FHLB is based on an FHLB program collateralized by a blanket lien on certain qualifying loans that are not pledged to the FRBSF.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the borrowing capacity under the FHLB secured borrowing lines was   $2.0 billion  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , the balance outstanding was   $410.0 million  , which consisted of a   $210.0 million   overnight advance and a   $200.0 million   one-month advance with an October 31, 2016 maturity date.  As of   December 31, 2015  , the entire outstanding balance of   $618.0 million   was an overnight advance.

FRBSF Secured Line of Credit.    The Bank has a secured line of credit with the FRBSF. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had secured borrowing capacity of   $2.4 billion   collateralized by liens covering   $3.3 billion   of certain qualifying loans. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   no   balances outstanding. 
  Federal Funds Arrangements with Commercial Banks.    As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had uncommitted unsecured lines of credit of   $80.0 million   with correspondent banks for the purchase of overnight funds, subject to availability of funds. These lines are renewable annually and have   no   unused commitment fees. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   no   balances outstanding. In March 2016, the Bank became a member of the American Financial Exchange, through which it may either borrow or lend funds on an overnight basis with a group of pre-approved commercial banks. The availability of funds changes daily.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the balance outstanding was   $40.0 million  .  
  FHLB Unsecured Line of Credit.    The Bank has a   $99.0 million   unsecured line of credit with the FHLB for the purchase of overnight funds of which   $90.0 million   was outstanding at   September 30, 2016  .  There was   no   balance outstanding at December 31, 2015. 
  Subordinated Debentures 
  The following table summarizes the terms of each issuance of subordinated debentures outstanding as of the dates indicated: 
   
 ___________________ 
           (1) 
    Denomination is in Euros with a value of    25.8 million  . 
              (2) 
    Amount represents the fair value adjustment on subordinated debentures assumed in acquisitions. 
     Interest payments made by the Company on subordinated debentures are considered dividend payments under the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ( FRB ) regulations. Bank holding companies, such as PacWest, are required to notify the FRB prior to declaring and paying a dividend during any period in which quarterly and/or cumulative twelve month net earnings are insufficient to fund the dividend amount, among other requirements.

Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies  
  Lending Commitments 
  The Company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and commitments to purchase equipment being acquired for lease to others. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Company has in particular classes of financial instruments. 
  The following table presents a summary of the financial instruments described above as of the dates indicated: 

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. 
  Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. We provide standby letters of credit in conjunction with several of our lending arrangements and property lease obligations. Most guarantees expire within one year from the date of issuance. If a borrower defaults on its commitments subject to any letter of credit issued under these arrangements, we would be required to meet the borrower's financial obligation but would seek repayment of that financial obligation from the borrower. In some cases, borrowers have pledged cash and investment securities as collateral with us under these arrangements. 
  In addition, we invest in low income housing project partnerships, which provide income tax credits, and in small business investment companies that call for capital contributions up to an amount specified in the partnership agreements. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had commitments to contribute capital to these entities totaling   $25.6 million   and   $19.2 million  .  We also had commitments to contribute up to an additional   $3.0 million   and   $2.8 million   to private equity funds at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . In addition, at   September 30, 2016   we had commitments to purchase approximately   $105 million   of loans, which commitments terminate in June 2017. The amount purchased will be based, in part, on the amount of portfolio paydowns which occur during the commitment period.   
  Legal Matters 
  In the ordinary course of our business, the Company is party to various legal actions, which we believe are incidental to the operation of our business. The outcome of such legal actions and the timing of ultimate resolution are inherently difficult to predict. In the opinion of management, based upon currently available information, any resulting liability, in addition to amounts already accrued, and taking into consideration insurance which may be applicable, would not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial statements or operations. 
  Kinde Durkee Investigation 
  The United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of California is conducting an investigation relating to the handling by First California Bank ("FCB") of its banking relationship with Kinde Durkee. Ms. Durkee, who had maintained certain of her accounts with FCB, was convicted in 2012 of embezzling funds from certain California politicians, among others. FCB was acquired by PacWest Bancorp and merged into Pacific Western Bank in May 2013. We understand that the investigation is focused on whether any civil or criminal laws were violated by FCB or its employees. Pacific Western is cooperating with the investigation.

Note 9.  Fair Value Measurements  
  ASC Topic 820,    Fair Value Measurement  ,  defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value including a three level valuation hierarchy, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date reflecting assumptions that a market participant would use when pricing an asset or liability. The hierarchy uses three levels of inputs to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities as follows: 
             
    Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 
                
    Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in less active markets, or other observable inputs that can be corroborated by observable market data, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. This category generally includes municipal securities, agency residential and commercial MBS, collateralized loan obligations, registered publicly rated private label CMOs and asset-backed securitizations. 
                
    Level 3: Inputs to a valuation methodology that are unobservable, supported by little or no market activity, and significant to the fair value measurement. These valuation methodologies generally include pricing models, discounted cash flow models, or a determination of fair value that requires significant management judgment or estimation. This category also includes observable inputs from a pricing service not corroborated by observable market data, and includes our non-rated private label CMOs, non-rated private label asset-backed securities, and equity warrants. 
     We use fair value to measure certain assets and liabilities on a recurring basis, primarily securities available for sale and derivatives.  For assets measured at the lower of cost or fair value, the fair value measurement criteria may or may not be met during a reporting period and such measurements are therefore considered  nonrecurring  for purposes of disclosing our fair value measurements. Fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to adjust carrying values for impaired loans and other real estate owned and also to record impairment on certain assets, such as goodwill, core deposit intangibles, and other long lived assets. 
  The following tables present information on the assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as of the dates indicated:

There were   no   transfers of assets either between Level 1 and Level 2 nor in or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for assets measured on a recurring basis during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  The following table presents information about quantitative inputs and assumptions used to determine the fair values provided by our third party pricing service for our Level 3 private label CMOs and asset-backed securities available-for-sale measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016  :

ASC Topic 825,    Financial Instruments  ,  requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of certain financial instruments and the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate such fair values. Additionally, certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments are excluded from the applicable disclosure requirements. 
  The following tables present a summary of the carrying values and estimated fair values of certain financial instruments as of the dates indicated:

PACWEST BANCORP AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

For information regarding the valuation methodologies used to measure our assets recorded at fair value (under ASC Topic 820), and for estimating fair value for financial instruments not recorded at fair value (under ASC Topic 825), see Note 1.   Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,   and Note 13.   Fair Value     Measurements,   to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company's   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
  Limitations 
  Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time and are based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect income taxes or any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because no market exists for a portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on what management believes to be reasonable judgments regarding expected future cash flows, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimated fair values are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. Since the fair values have been estimated as of   September 30, 2016  , the amounts that will actually be realized or paid at settlement or maturity of the instruments could be significantly different.

Note 10. Earnings Per Share  
  The following table presents the computations of basic and diluted net earnings per share for the periods indicated:  

________________________ 
           (1) 
    Represents cash dividends paid to holders of unvested restricted stock, net of estimated forfeitures, plus undistributed earnings amounts available to holders of unvested restricted stock, if any. 
      
  Note 11. Stock-Based Compensation 
  The Company s 2003 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 2003 Plan, permits stock-based compensation awards to officers, directors, key employees and consultants. As of   September 30, 2016  , the 2003 Plan authorized grants of stock based compensation instruments to purchase or issue up to   19,686,565   shares of Company common stock, subject to adjustments provided by the 2003 Plan.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   12,450,068   shares available for grant under the 2003 Plan.  
  Restricted stock amortization totaled   $5.6 million  ,   $6.0 million  , and   $3.8 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   June 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   and,   $16.6 million   and   $11.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015.  Such amounts are included in "Compensation expense" on the condensed consolidated statements of earnings.   The amount of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested time-based restricted stock awards ("TRSAs") and performance-based restricted stock units ("PRSUs") as of   September 30, 2016   totaled   $45.7 million  .  
  Time-Based Restricted Stock Awards 
  At   September 30, 2016  , there were   1,397,715   shares of unvested TRSAs outstanding. The TRSAs generally vest over a service period of   three   or   four   years from the date of the grant or immediately upon the death of an employee.  Compensation expense related to TRSAs is based on the fair value of the underlying stock on the award date and is recognized over the vesting period using the straight line method.

Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units 
  At   September 30, 2016  , there were   153,715   units of unvested PRSUs outstanding. The PRSUs will vest only if performance goals with respect to certain financial metrics are met over a three-year performance period. Compensation expense related to PRSUs is based on the fair value of the underlying stock on the award date and is amortized over the vesting period using the straight-line method unless it is determined that: (1) attainment of the financial metrics is less than probable, in which case a portion of the amortization is suspended, or (2) attainment of the financial metrics is improbable, in which case a portion of the previously recognized amortization is reversed and also suspended.  In the case where the performance target for the PRSU s is based on a market condition (such as total shareholder return), the amortization is neither reversed nor suspended if it is subsequently determined that the attainment of the performance target is less than probable or improbable. 
   
  Note 12.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards  
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, "  Revenue Recognition (Topic 606): Revenue from Contracts with Customers."   ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date,"   which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, while earlier application is permitted only for annual and interim periods beginning after December 31, 2016. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and does not expect the provisions of ASU 2014-09 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. The Company will adopt this standard effective January 1, 2018. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, "  Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  ," which will significantly change the income statement impact of equity investments and the recognition of changes in fair value of financial liabilities when the fair value option is elected.  For equity investments with readily determinable fair values, entities must measure these investments at fair value and recognize changes in fair value in net income.  For equity investments without readily determinable fair values, entities have the option to either measure these investments at fair value or at cost, adjusted for changes in observable prices, minus impairment.  Changes in measurement under either alternative must be recognized in net income.  ASU 2016-01 will be effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-01 will have on its financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "  Leases (Topic 842)  ," which, among other things, requires lessees to recognize most leases on-balance sheet, which will result in an increase in their reported assets and liabilities. Lessor accounting remains substantially similar to current U.S. GAAP. ASU 2016-02 supersedes Topic 840,   Leases  . ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. ASU 2016-02 mandates a modified retrospective transition method for all entities.  The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on its financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07,   Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting  , which eliminates the requirement for an investor to retroactively apply the equity method when its increase in ownership interest (or degree of influence) in an investee triggers equity method accounting.  ASU 2016-07 is effective for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that result in the adoption of the equity method. Earlier application is permitted. ASU 2016-07 does not require additional disclosures at transition.  The Company does not expect the effect of ASU 2016-06 to have a material impact on its financial statements and related disclosures.

PACWEST BANCORP AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which is intended to improve the accounting for share-based payment transactions as part of the FASB s simplification initiative. ASU 2016-09 changes aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (1) accounting for income taxes; (2) classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows; (3) forfeitures; (4) minimum statutory tax withholding requirements; and (5) classification of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes.  ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years.  Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period provided that the entire ASU is adopted.  If an entity early adopts the amendments after the first interim period, the adoption date is as of the beginning of the year for the issues adopted by the cumulative-effect and prospective methods and any adjustments to previously reported interim periods of that fiscal year should be included in the year-to-date results. If those previously reported interim results appear in any future filings, they are reported on the revised basis.  The Company does not expect the effect of ASU 2016-09 to have a material impact on its financial statements and related disclosures in the period of adoption. In subsequent periods, we expect the requirements of ASU 2016-09 to result in fluctuations in our effective tax rate from period to period based upon the timing of share-based award vestings.  
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  , which significantly changes the way entities recognize impairment of many financial assets by requiring immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur over their remaining life.  ASU 2016-13 is effective for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.  The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-13 will have on its financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  , which addressed eight issues related to the statement of cash flows, including proceeds from the settlement of bank-owned life insurance ("BOLI") policies.  ASU 2016-15 is effective for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.  If an entity early adopts ASU 2016-15 in an interim period, adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period.  An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendment in the same period.  Entities should apply ASU 2016-15 using a retrospective transition method to each period presented.  If it is impracticable for an entity to apply ASU 2016-15 retrospectively for some of the issues, it may apply the amendments for those issues prospectively as of the earliest date practicable.  ASU 2016-15 will result in some changes in classification in the consolidated statements of cash flows, which the Company does not expect will be significant, and will not have any impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.  
   
  Note 13. Subsequent Events 
  Stock Repurchase Program  
  On October 17, 2016, PacWest s Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program (the  Stock Repurchase Program ), pursuant to which the Company may, from time to time, purchase shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed   $400 million  . The common stock repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions, and may utilize any derivative or similar instrument to effect share repurchase transactions (including without limitation, accelerated share repurchase contracts, equity forward transactions, equity option transactions, equity swap transactions, cap transactions, collar transactions, floor transactions or other similar transactions or any combination of the foregoing transactions).  The Stock Repurchase Program expires on December 31, 2017.  The amount and exact timing of any repurchases will depend upon market conditions and other factors.  The Stock Repurchase Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. 
  Common Stock Dividends       
  On   November 1, 2016  , the Company announced that the Board of Directors had declared a quarterly cash dividend of   $0.50   per common share. The cash dividend is payable on   November 30, 2016   to stockholders of record at the close of business on   November 15, 2016  . 
  We have evaluated events that have occurred subsequent to   September 30, 2016   and have concluded there are   no   other subsequent events that would require recognition in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

  Overview  
  PacWest Bancorp is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. Our principal business is to serve as the holding company for our Los Angeles based wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Pacific Western Bank.  References to "Pacific Western" or the "Bank" refer to Pacific Western Bank together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries.  References to  we,   us,  "our," or the  Company  refer to PacWest Bancorp together with its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.  When we refer to  PacWest  or to the  holding company,  we are referring to PacWest Bancorp, the parent company, on a stand-alone basis.  
  We are focused on relationship-based business banking to small, middle-market and venture-backed businesses nationwide. The Bank offers a broad range of loan and lease and deposit products and services through   79   full-service branches located throughout the state of California,   one   branch located in Durham, North Carolina, and several loan production offices located in cities across the country.  The Bank provides commercial banking services, including real estate, construction, and commercial loans and leases, and comprehensive deposit and treasury management services to small and middle-market businesses. Pacific Western offers additional products and services through its CapitalSource and Square 1 Bank divisions. CapitalSource provides cash flow, asset-based, equipment and real estate loans and treasury management services to established middle-market businesses on a national basis. Square 1 Bank offers a comprehensive suite of financial services focused on entrepreneurial businesses and their venture capital and private equity investors, with offices located in key innovation hubs across the United States. In addition, we provide investment advisory and asset management services to select clients through Square 1 Asset Management, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank and a SEC-registered investment adviser.  
  In managing the top line of our business, we focus on loan growth, loan yield, deposit cost, and net interest margin. Net interest income, on a year-to-date basis in   2016  , accounted for   89.5%   of our net revenues (net interest income plus noninterest income). 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had total assets of   $21.3 billion  , including $  14.7 billion   of loans and leases, net of deferred fees, compared to   $21.3 billion   of total assets, including $14.5 billion of loans and leases, net of deferred fees, at   December 31, 2015  . Total assets increased   $26.8 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   due to a   $264.6 million   increase in loans and leases, net of deferred fees, driven by new production, and an increase of   $143.9 million   in cash and cash equivalents, offset partially by a   $218.1 million   decrease in securities available-for-sale due to sales from ongoing portfolio management activities and a   $99.3 million   decrease in deferred tax assets.    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had total liabilities of   $16.8 billion  , including total deposits of   $15.6 billion   and borrowings of   $541.0 million   compared to $  16.9 billion   of total liabilities, including $  15.7 billion   of total deposits and   $621.9 million   of borrowings at   December 31, 2015  . The   $118.1 million   decrease in total liabilities since year-end is due to a   $1.6 billion   decrease in higher-cost time deposits and an   $80.9 million   decrease in borrowings, primarily overnight FHLB advances, offset by a   $1.4 billion   increase in lower-cost core deposits and a   $139.9 million   increase in brokered non-maturity deposits.  At   September 30, 2016  , core deposits totaled   $12.0 billion  , or   77%   of total deposits, and time deposits totaled   $2.6 billion  , or   16%   of total deposits.  
  On March 31, 2016, we sold our Pacific Western Equipment Finance leasing unit in Midvale, Utah, including approximately   $139 million   of outstanding lease balances.

Recent Events 
  Stock Repurchase Program  
  On October 17, 2016, PacWest s Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program (the  Stock Repurchase Program ), pursuant to which the Company may, from time to time, purchase shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed $400 million. The common stock repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions, and may utilize any derivative or similar instrument to effect share repurchase transactions (including without limitation, accelerated share repurchase contracts, equity forward transactions, equity option transactions, equity swap transactions, cap transactions, collar transactions, floor transactions or other similar transactions or any combination of the foregoing transactions). 
  The Stock Repurchase Program expires on December 31, 2017.  The amount and exact timing of any repurchases will depend upon market conditions and other factors.  The Stock Repurchase Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. 
  Sale of Branches       
  On September 30, 2016 Pacific Western entered into a definitive agreement to sell two branches to First Foundation Bank (the  Transaction ).  The branches are located in Laguna Hills and Seal Beach, California (the  Branches ).  As of September 30, 2016, the deposits of the Branches totaled approximately $200 million, principally comprised of time deposits.  No loans are being sold in connection with the Transaction.  The Transaction is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2016 subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. 
  Square 1 Financial, Inc. Acquisition  
  PacWest acquired Square 1 Financial, Inc. ( Square 1 ) on October 6, 2015.  As part of the acquisition, Square 1 Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Square 1, merged with and into Pacific Western. At closing, we formed the Square 1 Bank Division of the Pacific Western which focuses on providing a comprehensive suite of financial services to entrepreneurial businesses and their venture capital and private equity investors nationwide. We completed this acquisition to increase our core deposits, expand our lending products across the nation, and increase our presence in the technology and life-sciences credit markets. We recorded the assets and liabilities, both tangible and intangible, at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date and increased total assets by approximately $4.6 billion. The application of the acquisition method of accounting resulted in goodwill of   $446.1 million  .  For further information, see Note 2.   Acquisitions  , in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) contained in  Item 1. Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited).  
   
  Key Performance Indicators  
  Among other factors, our operating results depend generally on the following key performance indicators: 
  The Level of Net Interest Income 
  Net interest income is the excess of interest earned on our interest earning assets over the interest paid on our interest bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is net interest income (annualized) expressed as a percentage of average interest earning assets.  Tax equivalent net interest income is net interest income increased by an adjustment for tax-exempt income on certain municipal securities based on a 35% federal statutory tax rate.  Tax equivalent net interest margin is calculated as tax equivalent net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.  A sustained low interest rate environment combined with low loan growth and high levels of marketplace liquidity may reduce both our net interest income and net interest margin going forward. 
  
   38 

Our primary interest earning assets are loans and investment securities, and our primary interest bearing liabilities are deposits. Contributing to our high net interest margin is our high yield on loans and leases and competitive cost of deposits. While our deposit balances will fluctuate depending on deposit holders  perceptions of alternative yields available in the market, we seek to minimize the impact of these variances by attracting a high percentage of noninterest bearing deposits. As a result of the CapitalSource Inc. merger,   $5.3 billion   of time deposits were assumed. Our goal is to continue replacing these higher-costing time deposits with core deposits. The acquisition of Square 1 accelerated this shift in deposit mix as nearly all of the $3.8 billion of acquired deposits were core deposits.  The Square 1 acquisition increased our on-balance sheet liquidity and enables us to maintain adequate liquidity as we manage down the level of higher-cost time deposits. 
  Loan and Lease Growth 
  We actively seek new lending opportunities under an array of commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial ("C I") lending products. Our targeted collateral for our real estate loan offerings includes healthcare properties, office properties, industrial properties, multifamily properties, hospitality properties, and retail properties. Our C I loan products include equipment-secured loans and leases, asset-secured loans, loans to finance companies, and cash flow loans (which are loans secured by borrower future cash flows and borrower enterprise value) and venture capital-backed loans to entrepreneurial companies to support early-stage operations. Our loan origination process emphasizes credit quality. We foster lender relationships with borrowers that have proven loan repayment performance. Our commitment sizes vary by loan product and can range up to $100 million for certain asset-based lending arrangements and multi-property real estate loans. We price loans to preserve our interest spread and maintain our net interest margin. Achieving net loan growth is subject to many factors, including maintaining strict credit standards, competition from other lenders, and successful borrowers that opt to prepay loans.  
  The Magnitude of Credit Losses 
  We emphasize credit quality in originating and monitoring our loans and leases, and we measure our success by the levels of our classified and nonperforming assets and net charge offs.  We maintain an allowance for credit losses on loans and leases, which is the sum of our allowance for loan and lease losses and our reserve for unfunded loan commitments. Provisions for credit losses are charged to operations as and when needed for both on and off balance sheet credit exposure. Loans and leases which are deemed uncollectable are charged off and deducted from the allowance for loan and lease losses. Recoveries on loans and leases previously charged off are added to the allowance for loan and lease losses. The provision for credit losses on the loan and lease portfolio is based on our allowance methodology which considers various credit performance measures such as historical and current net charge offs, the levels and trends of nonaccrual and classified loans and leases, the migration of loans and leases into various risk classifications, and the overall level of outstanding loans and leases. For originated and acquired non impaired loans, a provision for credit losses may be recorded to reflect credit deterioration after the origination date or after the acquisition date, respectively. For purchased credit impaired ("PCI") loans, a provision for credit losses may be recorded to reflect decreases in expected cash flows on such loans compared to those previously estimated. 
  We regularly review our loans and leases to determine whether there has been any deterioration in credit quality stemming from borrower operations or changes in collateral value or other factors which may affect collectability of our loans and leases. Changes in economic conditions, such as the rate of economic growth, the rate of inflation, the unemployment rate, increases in the general level of interest rates, declines in real estate values, changes in commodity prices (such as crude oil), and adverse conditions in borrowers  businesses, could negatively impact our borrowers and cause us to adversely classify loans and leases.  An increase in classified loans and leases generally results in increased provisions for credit losses and an increased allowance for credit losses. Any deterioration in the commercial real estate market may lead to increased provisions for credit losses because of our concentration in commercial real estate loans. 
  The Level of Noninterest Expense 
  Our noninterest expense includes fixed and controllable overhead, the major components of which are compensation, occupancy, data processing, and other professional services. It also includes costs that tend to vary based on the volume of activity, such as loan and lease production and the number and complexity of foreclosed assets. We measure success in controlling both fixed and variable costs through monitoring of the efficiency ratio. We calculate the efficiency ratio by dividing noninterest expense (less intangible asset amortization, net foreclosed assets expense (income), and acquisition, integration and reorganization costs) by net revenues (the sum of tax equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, less gain (loss) on sale of securities).  
  
   39 

The following table presents the calculation of our efficiency ratio for the periods indicated: 

Critical Accounting Policies  
  The Company s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition. The Company has identified several policies as being critical because they require management to make particularly difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. These policies relate to the allowance for credit losses, the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions, the carrying values of intangible assets, and the realization of deferred income tax assets. For further information, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
   
  Non-GAAP Measurements  
  The Company uses certain non GAAP financial measures to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company s operational performance and to enhance investors  overall understanding of such financial performance.   The methodology for determining these non-GAAP measures may differ among companies.  The non-GAAP measures used in this Form 10-Q include the following: 
             
    Core net interest margin and core loan and lease yield:   The tax equivalent net interest margin ("NIM") and loan and lease yield are impacted by volatility in accelerated accretion of acquisition discounts due to the prepayment of acquired loans and leases. We disclose the core NIM and core loan and lease yield to provide an indication of what these measures would be without the effects of accelerated accretion as this indicates a "normalized" measure and a more accurate indicator of future performance. See  -Results of Operations-  Net Interest Income    for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measurements to the GAAP measurements for the periods presented. 
                
    Adjusted allowance for credit losses to loans and leases:   As the allowance for credit losses takes into consideration credit deterioration on acquired loans and leases only after the purchase date and an estimate of credit losses is included in their initial fair values, we disclose two adjusted allowance for credit losses to loans and leases ratios in addition to the allowance for credit losses to loans and leases. The first adjusted allowance for credit losses to loans and leases excludes the allowance related to acquired loans and leases from the numerator and the acquired loans and leases from the denominator. The second ratio excludes the remaining unamortized purchase discount from both the numerator and the denominator.  We disclose these ratios to more clearly illustrate the amounts established on our balance sheet for credit losses related to acquired loans in addition to the allowance for credit losses. See "-Balance Sheet Analysis-  Allowance for Credit Losses on Non-PCI Loans and Leases  " for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measurements to the GAAP measurement as of the dates presented. 
     
   40 

Return on average tangible equity, tangible common equity ratio, and tangible book value per share:   Given that the use of these measures is prevalent among banking regulators, investors and analysts, we disclose them in addition to the related GAAP measures of return on average equity, equity to assets ratio, and book value per share, respectively.  The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measurements to the GAAP measurements is presented in the following tables for and as of the periods presented:

Results of Operations 
  Acquisitions Impact Earnings Performance 
  The comparability of financial information is affected by our acquisitions. We completed the Square 1 acquisition on October 6, 2015, adding assets of   $4.6 billion  . This transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, the related operating results have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.

    Calculation excludes accelerated accretion of acquisition discounts from early payoffs of acquired loans. 
     Third Quarter   of   2016   Compared to   Second Quarter   of   2016    
  Net earnings were   $93.9 million  , or   $0.77   per diluted share, for the   third quarter   of   2016  , compared to   $82.2 million  , or   $0.68   per diluted share, for the   second quarter   of   2016  . The quarter over quarter increase of   $11.7 million   in net earnings was due to a lower provision for credit losses of   $5.4 million  , higher noninterest income of   $4.8 million  , and a lower effective tax rate as compared to the second quarter of 2016.  The decrease in the provision for credit losses was due in part to a $4.8 million increase in recoveries of previously charged off loans.  The increase in noninterest income was due to the elimination of FDIC loss sharing expense. The second quarter expense of   $6.5 million   included a pre-tax charge attributable to the early termination of all FDIC loss sharing agreements. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was lower due to certain discrete items associated with completion of the 2015 tax returns. 
  Third Quarter   of   2016   Compared to   Third Quarter   of   2015    
  Net earnings for the   third quarter   of   2016   were   $93.9 million  , or   $0.77   per diluted share, compared to net earnings for the   third quarter   of   2015   of   $69.6 million  , or   $0.68   per diluted share. The   $24.3 million   increase in net earnings was due to higher net interest income of   $42.1 million   and higher noninterest income of $  11.2 million   offset by higher noninterest expense of   $20.6 million  . These increases were due primarily to including the operations of Square 1 subsequent to the October 6, 2015 acquisition date. The increase in net interest income was attributable to higher average balances for loans and leases and investment securities and lower interest expense, offset by lower discount accretion on acquired loans and lower yields on average loans and leases and investment securities.  The increase in noninterest income was due mainly to higher other commissions and fees, higher leased equipment income, and lower FDIC loss sharing expense, offset by lower dividends and realized gains on equity investments.  
  
   42 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Net earnings for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   $266.5 million  , or   $2.19   per diluted share, compared to net earnings for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   of   $227.8 million  , or   $2.21   per diluted share. The   $38.7 million   increase in net earnings was due to higher net interest income of   $118.8 million   and higher noninterest income of $  27.3 million  , offset by higher noninterest expense of   $71.7 million   and a higher provision for credit losses of   $10.8 million  . These increases were due primarily to including the operations of Square 1 subsequent to the October 6, 2015 acquisition date. The increase in net interest income was attributable to higher average interest-earning asset balances and lower interest expense, offset by lower discount accretion on acquired loans and lower yields on average loans and leases and investment securities.  The increase in noninterest income was due mainly to higher other commissions and fees, higher leased equipment income, higher gain on sale of securities, lower FDIC loss sharing expense, and higher service charges on deposit accounts, offset by lower dividends and realized gains on equity investments.

Third Quarter   of   2016   Compared to   Second Quarter   of   2016    
  Net interest income increased by $  0.9 million   to   $234.6 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   $233.8 million   for the   second quarter   of   2016   due to a higher average loan and lease balance, higher nonaccrual interest recoveries, and one additional day in the period, offset by a lower loan and lease yield. The loan and lease yield for the   third quarter   of   2016   was   6.17%   compared to   6.24%   for the   second quarter   of   2016  .  The decrease in the loan and lease yield was due to the lower discount accretion on acquired loans and the lower yield on new production compared to the current portfolio yield. Total discount accretion on acquired loans was   $14.2 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016   (  39   basis points on the loan and lease yield) compared to   $16.2 million   in the   second quarter   of   2016   (  45   basis points on the loan and lease yield). Excluding accelerated accretion, the core loan and lease yield was   5.94%   in the   third quarter   compared to   5.97%   in the   second quarter  . 
  The tax equivalent NIM for the   third quarter   of   2016   was   5.26%   compared to   5.33%   for the   second quarter   of   2016  . The decrease in the tax equivalent NIM was due to lower discount accretion on acquired loans. Total discount accretion on acquired loans contributed   31   basis points to the NIM in the   third quarter   of   2016   and   36   basis points in the   second quarter   of   2016  .  Excluding accelerated accretion, the core NIM was   5.08%   for the   third quarter   and   5.11%   for the   second quarter  . Tax-exempt interest income contributed   11   points to the tax equivalent NIM for the third and second quarters of   2016  . 
  Included in net interest income for the third quarter of 2016 was $3.0 million of interest resulting from the payoff in full of a nonperforming loan. This recovery contributed seven basis points to the third quarter 2016 NIM and eight basis points of loan and lease yield for the third quarter of 2016. 
  The cost of total deposits decreased to   0.19%   in the   third quarter   of   2016   from   0.20%   in the   second quarter   of   2016   due to a lower average cost and balance of time deposits.  
  Third Quarter   of   2016   Compared to   Third Quarter   of   2015    
  Net interest income increased by   $42.1 million   to   $234.6 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   $192.5 million   for the   third quarter   of   2015   due mainly to higher average balances for loans and leases and investment securities attributable to the Square 1 acquisition, offset partially by a lower loan and lease yield.  The loan and lease yield for the   third quarter   of   2016   was   6.17%   compared to   6.34%   for the same quarter of   2015  . The decrease in the loan and lease yield was due mainly to the lower discount accretion on acquired loans and yields on newly originated loans being lower than the average portfolio yield.  Total discount accretion on acquired loans was   $14.2 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016   (  39   basis points on the loan and lease yield) compared to   $17.1 million   in the   third quarter   of   2015   (  57   basis points on the loan and lease yield).  
  The tax equivalent NIM for the   third quarter   of   2016   was   5.26%   compared to   5.46%   for the same quarter last year.  The decrease in the tax equivalent NIM was due mostly to the decrease in the loan and lease yield as described above, the lower yield on average investment securities and loans and leases comprising a lower percentage of average interest-earning assets. Total discount accretion on acquired loans contributed   31   basis points to the NIM for the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   48   basis points for the   third quarter   of   2015  . Tax-exempt interest income contributed   11   basis points to the tax equivalent NIM for the   third quarter   of   2016   and   eight   basis points for the   third quarter   of   2015  . 
  The cost of total deposits decreased to   0.19%   for the   third quarter   of   2016   from   0.33%   for the   third quarter   of   2015   due mainly to the $3.8 billion of lower-cost core deposits added in the Square 1 acquisition, a lower level of higher-cost time deposits, and a lower average cost of interest-bearing deposits. 
  
   47 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Net interest income increased by   $118.8 million   to   $713.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $594.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   due mainly to higher average interest-earning asset balances attributable to the Square 1 acquisition, offset partially by lower discount accretion on acquired loans and lower yields on average loans and leases and investment securities.  The loan and lease yield for the first nine months of 2016 was   6.32%   compared to   6.63%   for the same period in 2015. The decrease in the loan and lease yield was due mainly to the lower discount accretion on acquired loans and yields on new production being lower than the average portfolio yield.  Total discount accretion on acquired loans was   $58.3 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   (  54   basis points on the loan and lease yield) compared to   $73.6 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   (  81   basis points on the loan and lease yield). Discount accretion for the 2016 period includes $12.1 million of accelerated accretion from the payoff of a nonaccrual PCI loan, resulting in the higher PCI loan yield. 
  The tax equivalent NIM for the first nine months of 2016 was   5.37%   compared to   5.76%   for the same period last year.  The decrease in the tax equivalent NIM was due mostly to the decrease in loan and lease yield as described above and loans and leases comprising a lower percentage of average interest-earning assets.  Total discount accretion on acquired loans contributed   43   basis points to the NIM for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   71   basis points for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  Tax-exempt interest income contributed   11   basis points to the tax equivalent NIM for the first six months of 2016 and   six   basis points for the same period last year. 
  The cost of total deposits decreased to   0.21%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   0.35%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   due mainly to the $3.8 billion of lower-cost core deposits added in the Square 1 acquisition, a lower level of higher-cost time deposits, and a lower average cost of interest-bearing deposits.

Provision for Credit Losses 
  The following table sets forth the details of the provision for credit losses and allowance for credit losses data for the periods indicated:   

  Provisions for credit losses are charged to earnings for both on and off balance sheet credit exposures. We have a provision for credit losses on our Non PCI loans and leases and a provision for credit losses on our PCI loans. The provision for credit losses on our Non PCI loans and leases is based on our allowance methodology and is an expense, or contra expense, that, in our judgment, is required to maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses. Our allowance methodology uses our actual historical loan and lease charge-off experience on pools of similar loans and leases, considers the current credit risk ratings, giving greater weight to loans with more adverse credit risk ratings, and considers subjective criteria such as current economic trends and forecasts, current commercial real estate values and performance trends, and the loan portfolio credit performance trends.  The provision for credit losses on our PCI loans results from decreases or increases in expected cash flows on such loans compared to those previously estimated. 
  We recorded a total provision for credit losses of   $8.5 million   in the   third   quarter of 2016,   $13.9 million   in the   second quarter   of 2016 and $8.7 million in the third quarter of 2015 in accordance with our allowance methodology. The provision for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $42.5 million   compared to   $31.7 million   in the same period last year and increased due to net portfolio growth, portfolio mix and asset quality, including the level of net charge-offs and specific reserves.     
  Certain circumstances may lead to increased provisions for credit losses in the future. Examples of such circumstances are  net loan and lease and unfunded commitment growth, an increased amount of loan and lease charge-offs, changes in economic conditions, such as the rate of economic growth, the rate of inflation, the unemployment rate, increases in the general level of interest rates, declines in real estate values and adverse conditions in borrowers  businesses.  See further discussion in  -Balance Sheet Analysis  -Allowance for Credit Losses on Non PCI Loans    and  -Balance Sheet Analysis  -Allowance for Credit Losses on PCI Loans    contained herein.

Noninterest Income 
  The following table summarizes noninterest income by category for the periods indicated: 

Third Quarter   of   2016   Compared to   Second Quarter   of   2016    
  Noninterest income increased by   $4.8 million   to   $26.9 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   $22.1 million   for the   second quarter   of   2016   due mostly to a   $6.5 million   decrease in FDIC loss sharing expense and a $1.5 million increase in other commissions and fees, offset by a   $1.8 million   decrease in dividends and realized gains on equity investments and a   $0.5 million   decrease in foreign currency translation net gains.  The elimination of FDIC loss sharing expense was due to the early termination of all FDIC loss sharing agreements for which a $6.0 million pre-tax charge was recognized in the second quarter.  Other commissions and fees increased due to higher prepayment and other loan-related fees.   
  Third Quarter   of   2016   Compared to   Third Quarter   of   2015    
  Noninterest income increased by   $11.2 million   to   $26.9 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   $15.8 million   for the   third quarter   of   2015  .  The increase was due mostly to higher other commissions and fees of   $6.2 million  , higher leased equipment income of   $3.1 million  , and lower FDIC loss sharing expense of   $4.4 million  , offset by lower dividends and realized gains on equity investments of   $4.0 million  .  The increase in other commissions and fees included $3.1 million from loan prepayment penalty fees, $1.7 million from foreign exchange fees, $0.8 million from credit card fees, and $0.5 million from letter of credit fees. The revenue streams from foreign exchange fees and credit card fees were gained in the Square 1 acquisition. The elimination of FDIC loss sharing expense was due to the early termination of our loss sharing agreements with the FDIC in the second quarter of 2016.  

50 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Noninterest income increased by   $27.3 million   to   $83.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $56.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The increase was due mostly to higher other commissions and fees of   $16.2 million  , higher leased equipment income of   $9.1 million  , higher gain on sales of securities of   $5.2 million  , lower FDIC loss sharing expense of   $5.0 million  , and higher service charges on deposit accounts of   $3.2 million  , offset by lower dividends and realized gains on equity investments of   $13.2 million  .  The increase in other commissions and fees was comprised mostly of $6.2 million from loan prepayment penalty fees, $5.5 million from foreign exchange fees, $2.3 million from credit card fees, and $1.4 million from letter of credit fees.  The increases in foreign exchange fees and credit card fees were due to the Square 1 acquisition.  The decrease in FDIC loss sharing expense was due mainly to lower amortization of the FDIC loss sharing asset, offset partially by the $6.0 million pre-tax charge recognized in the second quarter of 2016 to terminate all FDIC loss sharing agreements.  The increase in service charges on deposits was due primarily to increased deposits as a result of the Square 1 acquisition.  
   
  Noninterest Expense

The following table presents the components of foreclosed assets (income) expense, net for the periods indicated: 

51 

Third Quarter   of   2016   Compared to   Second Quarter   of   2016    
  Noninterest expense increased by   $0.6 million   to   $110.7 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   $110.1 million   for the   second quarter   of   2016  . The expense category with the highest increase was other professional services, which increased $1.2 million primarily due to higher litigation expense.  
  Third Quarter   of   2016   Compared to   Third Quarter   of   2015    
  Noninterest expense increased by   $20.6 million   to   $110.7 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   $90.1 million   for the   third quarter   of   2015  .  The increase was due primarily to including the operations of Square 1 subsequent to its October 6, 2015 acquisition date, offset by lower foreclosed assets expense of   $4.8 million  . Foreclosed assets expense decreased due mainly to lower write-downs on existing properties.   
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Noninterest expense increased by   $71.7 million   to   $331.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $259.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The increase was due primarily to including the operations of Square 1 subsequent to its October 6, 2015 acquisition date, offset by lower acquisition, integration and reorganization costs of   $3.4 million   and lower foreclosed assets expense of   $3.3 million  . Foreclosed assets expense decreased due mainly to lower write-downs on existing properties, offset partially by lower operating income. 
   
  Income Taxes 
  The effective tax rate for the   third quarter   of   2016   was   34.1%   compared to   37.7%   for the   second quarter   of   2016   and   36.4%   for the   third quarter   of   2015  .  The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2016 was lower due to the net favorable treatment of certain items associated with completion of the 2015 tax returns. The expected effective tax rate for the calendar year 2016 is approximately 37.5%.  The Company's blended statutory tax rate for federal and state is 41%.

Our real estate loan portfolio exposes us to risks associated with mortgage loans on commercial property. Commercial real estate mortgage loan repayments typically do not rely on the sale of the underlying collateral, but instead rely on the income producing potential of the collateral as the source of repayment. However, due to the loan amortization period generally being greater than the contractual loan term, the borrower may be required to refinance the loan, either with us or another lender, or pay off the loan, by selling the underlying collateral.

Credit Exposure Affected by Low Oil Prices 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   14   outstanding loan and lease relationships totaling   $101.7 million   to borrowers and lessees primarily involved in the oil and gas industry down from   $137.3 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The obligors under these loans and leases either conduct oil and gas extraction or provide industrial support services to such types of businesses. The collateral for these loans and leases includes primarily equipment, such as drilling and mining equipment and transportation vehicles, used directly and indirectly in these activities. At   September 30, 2016  ,   two   relationships totaling   $40.3 million   were on nonaccrual status and were classified, down from three relationships totaling   $47.1 million   at   December 31, 2015  .   The largest of these relationships had an aggregate outstanding balance of   $39.9 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  Reserves related to our total oil and gas services industry exposure were approximately   14%   at   September 30, 2016  , which included reserves of approximately   24%   related to our impaired oil and gas services industry exposure.  Unfunded commitments related to the oil and gas portfolio totaled   $21.6 million   at   September 30, 2016   and relate to   three   relationships governed with a borrowing base for accounts receivable and inventory.

  Allowance for Credit Losses on Non-PCI Loans and Leases 
  The allowance for credit losses on non-purchased credit impaired ("Non-PCI") loans and leases is the combination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded loan commitments. The allowance for loan and lease losses is reported as a reduction of outstanding loan and lease balances and the reserve for unfunded loan commitments is included within "Accrued interest payable and other liabilities" on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  The following discussion is for Non-PCI loans and leases and the allowance for credit losses thereon. Refer to "-Balance Sheet Analysis-  Allowance for Credit Losses on PCI Loans  " for the policy on PCI loans.  For loans and leases acquired and measured at fair value and deemed non-impaired on the acquisition date, our allowance methodology measures deterioration in credit quality or other inherent risks related to these acquired assets that may occur after the acquisition date. 
  The allowance for loan and lease losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to adequately provide for known and inherent risks in the loan and lease portfolio and other extensions of credit at the balance sheet date. The allowance is based upon our continual review of the credit quality of the loan and lease portfolio, which includes loan and lease payment trends, borrowers' compliance with loan agreements, borrowers' current and budgeted financial performance, collateral valuation trends, and current economic factors and external conditions that may affect our borrowers' ability to pay. Loans and leases that are deemed to be uncollectable are charged off and deducted from the allowance. The provision for loan and lease losses and recoveries on loans and leases previously charged off are added to the allowance. 
  The allowance for loan and lease losses contains a general reserve component for loans and leases with no credit impairment and a specific reserve component for loans and leases determined to be impaired.   
  
   56 

A loan or lease is considered impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the agreement. We assess our loans for impairment on an ongoing basis using certain criteria such as payment performance, borrower reported financial results and budgets, and other external factors when appropriate. We measure impairment of a loan based upon the fair value of the loan s collateral if the loan is collateral-dependent or the present value of cash flows, discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, if the loan is not collateral-dependent. We measure impairment of a lease based upon the present value of the scheduled lease and residual cash flows, discounted at the lease's effective interest rate.  To the extent a loan or lease balance exceeds the estimated collectable value, a specific reserve or charge-off is recorded depending upon the certainty of the estimate of loss. Smaller balance loans (under $250,000), with a few exceptions for certain loan types, are generally not individually assessed for impairment but are evaluated collectively. 
  The methodology we use to estimate the general reserve component of our allowance for credit losses considers both quantitative and qualitative criteria. The quantitative criteria uses our actual historical loan and lease charge-off experience on pools of similar loans and leases to establish loss factors that are applied to our current loan and lease balances to estimate inherent credit losses. When estimating the general reserve component for the various pools of similar loan types, the loss factors applied to the loan pools consider the current credit risk ratings, giving greater weight to loans with more adverse credit risk ratings.  We recognize that the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses is sensitive to the assigned credit risk ratings and inherent loss rates at any given point in time. To ensure the accuracy of our credit risk ratings, an independent credit review function assesses the ratings assigned to loans on an ongoing basis.  
  The qualitative criteria considered when establishing the loss factors include the following:  
             
    current economic trends and forecasts; 
                
    current commercial real estate values, performance trends, and overall outlook in the markets where we lend; 
                
    legal and regulatory matters that could impact our borrowers  ability to repay our loans and leases; 
                
    our loan and lease portfolio composition and any loan concentrations; 
                
    our current lending policies and the effects of any new policies or policy amendments; 
                
    our new loan and lease origination volume and the nature of it; 
                
    our loan and lease portfolio credit performance trends; and 
                
    the results of our ongoing independent credit review. 
     The reserve for unfunded commitments is estimated using the same loss factors as used for the allowance for loan and lease losses and is computed based only on the expected usage of the unfunded commitments. 
  The credit risk ratings assigned to every loan and lease are either  pass,   special mention,   substandard  or  doubtful  and defined as follows: 
             
    Pass: Loans and leases classified as "pass" are not adversely classified and collection and repayment in full are expected. 
                
    Special Mention: Loans and leases classified as "special mention" have a potential weakness that requires management's attention. If not addressed, these potential weaknesses may result in further deterioration in the borrower's ability to repay the loan or lease. 
                
    Substandard: Loans and leases classified as "substandard" have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the collection of the debt. They are characterized by the possibility that we will sustain some loss if the weaknesses are not corrected. 
                
    Doubtful: Loans and leases classified as "doubtful" have all the weaknesses of those classified as "substandard," with the additional trait that the weaknesses make collection or repayment in full highly questionable and improbable. 
     In addition, we may refer to the loans and leases with assigned credit risk ratings of "substandard" and "doubtful" together as "classified" loans and leases. For further information on classified loans and leases, see Note 5.   Loans and Leases  , of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) contained in "Item 1. Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)."  
  
   57 

Management believes the allowance for credit losses is appropriate for the known and inherent risks in our Non-PCI loan and lease portfolio and the credit risk ratings and inherent loss rates currently assigned are appropriate. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach different conclusions that could result in a significant impact to the Company's financial statements. In addition, current credit risk ratings are subject to change as we continue to monitor our loans and leases.  To the extent we experience, for example, increased levels of documentation deficiencies, adverse changes in collateral values, or negative changes in economic and business conditions that adversely affect our borrowers, our classified loans and leases may increase. Higher levels of classified loans and leases generally result in increased provisions for credit losses and an increased allowance for credit losses. Although we have established an allowance for credit losses that we consider appropriate, there can be no assurance that the established allowance will be sufficient to absorb related losses in the future.  
  The following table presents information regarding the allowance for credit losses on Non-PCI loans and leases as of the dates indicated: 

All acquired loans are recorded initially at their estimated fair value with such initial fair value including an estimate of credit losses.  Two additional credit coverage ratios shown in the table below are presented to give an indication of overall credit risk coverage: 

58 

The first additional credit coverage ratio calculation makes adjustments for acquired loans and leases and the related allowance. Our Non PCI loans and leases at   September 30, 2016  , included   $4.6 billion   in loans and leases acquired in acquisitions. These acquired loans and leases were initially recorded at their estimated fair values and such initial fair values included an estimate of credit losses. The allowance calculation for Non PCI loans and leases takes into consideration those acquired loans and leases whose credit quality has deteriorated since their acquisition dates. At   September 30, 2016  , our allowance for credit losses included   $46.0 million   related to these acquired loans and leases. When these acquired loans and leases are excluded from the total of Non PCI loans and leases and the related allowance is excluded from the allowance for credit losses, the result is an adjusted coverage ratio of our allowance for credit losses to Non PCI loans and leases of   1.07%   at   September 30, 2016  ; at   June 30, 2016  , this ratio was   1.19%  . 
  The second additional credit coverage ratio calculation makes an adjustment for the unamortized purchase discount on acquired loans and leases.  Our acquired Non-PCI loans and leases included an unamortized purchase discount of   $53.0 million   at   September 30, 2016  , which is assigned specifically to those loans and leases only.  Such discount represents the acquisition date fair value adjustment based on market, liquidity, interest rate and credit risk.  When the unamortized purchase discount is added back separately to both our Non-PCI loans and leases and allowance for credit losses, the result is an adjusted coverage ratio of our allowance for credit losses to Non-PCI loans and leases of   1.41%   at   September 30, 2016  ; at   June 30, 2016  , this ratio was   1.47%  . 
  The unamortized purchase discount is being accreted to interest income over the remaining life of the respective loans and leases primarily using the interest method. Use of the interest method results in steadily declining amounts being taken into income in each reporting period. The remaining discount of   $53.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   is expected to be substantially accreted to income by the end of 2018. 
   The following table presents the changes in our allowance for credit losses on Non-PCI loans and leases for the periods indicated: 

_______________________________________    

59 

Allowance for Credit Losses on PCI Loans 
  The PCI loans are subject to our internal and external credit review.  For PCI loans, the allowance for loan losses is measured at the end of each financial reporting period based on expected cash flows. Decreases or (increases) in the amount and changes in the timing of expected cash flows on the PCI loans as of the financial reporting date compared to those previously estimated are usually recognized by recording a provision or a (negative provision) for credit losses on such loans.  If deterioration in the expected cash flows results in a reserve requirement, a provision for credit losses is charged to earnings. 
  The following table presents the changes in our allowance for credit losses on PCI loans for the periods indicated: 

Nonperforming Assets, Performing Troubled Debt Restructured Loans, and Classified Loans and Leases 
  The following table presents nonperforming assets, performing troubled debt restructured loans, and classified loans and leases information as of the dates indicated: 

_______________________________________    
           (1) 
    Excludes PCI loans. 
       
  Nonperforming assets include Non-PCI and PCI nonaccrual loans and leases and foreclosed assets and totaled   $189.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $145.9 million   at   June 30, 2016  . The   $43.8 million   increase in nonperforming assets during the   third   quarter of 2016 was due to a   $44.9 million   increase in nonaccrual loans and leases and a   $1.1 million   decrease in foreclosed assets.  The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and leases and foreclosed assets increased to   1.28%   at   September 30, 2016   from   0.99%   at   June 30, 2016  .  During the   third   quarter of   2016  , Non-PCI classified loans and leases decreased by   $23.5 million   to   $417.5 million   as resolutions, including repayment in full of four loans totaling $49.9 million, exceeded new downgrades. 
  
   60 

Nonaccrual Loans and Leases 
  During the   third   quarter of 2016, nonaccrual loan and leases increased by   $44.9 million   to   $174.6 million   at September 30, 2016 due mainly to new nonaccrual additions of   $72.0 million  , offset by   $27.1 million   in principal payments and other reductions.   Additions included a $49.8 million healthcare real estate loan secured by a continuing care retirement facility which migrated to nonaccrual status due to continued weak operating performance and cash flow difficulties.   
  The following table presents our Non-PCI nonaccrual loans and leases and accruing loans and leases past due between 30 and 89 days by portfolio segment and class as of the dates indicated: 

_______________________________________    
     
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's ten largest Non-PCI loan relationships on nonaccrual status had an aggregate carrying value of   $145 million   and represented   84.5%   of total Non-PCI nonaccrual loans and leases. The largest of these relationships had an aggregate carrying value of   $49.8 million   and is described earlier in this "-  Nonaccrual Loans and Leases  " section.  
  
   61 

Foreclosed Assets 
  The following table presents the components of foreclosed assets (primarily other real estate owned, or OREO) as of the dates indicated: 

During the   third   quarter of 2016, foreclosed assets decreased by   $1.1 million   to   $15.1 million   at September 30, 2016 due to sales of   $1.1 million  .   
  Performing Troubled Debt Restructured Loans 
  During the   third   quarter of   2016  , Non-PCI performing troubled debt restructured loans decreased by   $1.4 million   to   $70.3 million   as the result of   $1.4 million   in payoffs and other reductions.  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $59.8 million   in real estate mortgage loans,   $7.1 million   in real estate construction and land loans,   $3.3 million   in commercial loans, and   $0.2 million   in consumer loans that were accruing interest under the terms of troubled debt restructurings. 
  The majority of the number of performing troubled debt restructured loans were on accrual status prior to the loan restructurings and have remained on accrual status after the loan restructurings due to the borrowers making payments before and after the restructurings.  

Deposits 
  The following table presents the balance of each major category of deposits at the dates indicated: 

62 

Total deposits increased by   $497.7 million   during the   third   quarter to   $15.6 billion  , due mainly to an increase in core deposits of   $598.6 million   offset partially by a decrease in time deposits of   $210.3 million  .  At   September 30, 2016  , core deposits totaled   $12.0 billion  , or   77%   of total deposits, including   $6.5 billion   of noninterest-bearing demand deposits, or   42%   of total deposits.  
  The following table summarizes the maturities of time deposits, together with their weighted average contractual rate, as of the date indicated: 

Brokered time deposits totaled   $404.5 million   and   $151.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  . 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , we had   $461 million   and   $537 million  , respectively, of time deposits that exceeded the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000, while the remaining   $2.1 billion   and   $2.2 billion   of time deposits met or fell below the FDIC insurance limit. 
   
  Regulatory Matters 
  Capital 
  Bank regulatory agencies measure capital adequacy through standardized risk-based capital guidelines that compare different levels of capital (as defined by such guidelines) to risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet obligations. At   September 30, 2016  , banks considered to be  well capitalized  must maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of   5.00%  , a minimum common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of   6.50%  , a minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of   8.00%  , and a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of   10.00%  . Regulatory capital requirements limit the amount of deferred tax assets that may be included when determining the amount of regulatory capital. Deferred tax asset amounts in excess of the calculated limit are disallowed from regulatory capital. At   September 30, 2016  , such disallowed amounts were   $11.3 million   for the Company and   $0.1 million   for the Bank. No assurance can be given that the regulatory capital deferred tax asset limitation will not increase in the future or that the Company or Bank will not have increased deferred tax assets that are disallowed.  
  Basel III, the comprehensive regulatory capital rules for U.S. banking organizations became effective for the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015, subject to phase-in periods for certain components and other provisions. The most significant provisions of Basel III which applied to the Company and the Bank were as follows: the phase-out of trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital, the higher risk-weighting of high volatility and past due real estate loans, and the capital treatment of deferred tax assets and liabilities above certain thresholds.

The following table presents a comparison of our actual capital ratios to the minimum required ratios and well capitalized ratios as of the dates indicated: 

Beginning January 1, 2016, Basel III implemented a requirement for all banking organizations to maintain a capital conservation buffer above the minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid certain limitations on capital distributions, stock repurchases and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The capital conservation buffer is exclusively comprised of common equity tier 1 capital, and it applies to each of the three risk-based capital ratios but not to the leverage ratio. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company and Bank are in compliance with the capital conservation buffer requirement. The capital conservation buffer will increase by 0.625% each year through 2019, at which point, the common equity tier 1, tier 1 and total capital ratio minimums inclusive of the capital conservation buffer will be 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively.

Subordinated Debentures 
  We issued subordinated debentures to trusts that were established by us or entities we previously acquired, which, in turn, issued trust preferred securities. The carrying value of subordinated debentures totaled   $441.1 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  At   September 30, 2016  ,   none   of the trust preferred securities was included in the Company's Tier I capital under the phase-out limitations of Basel III, and   $428.7 million   was included in Tier II capital.  
  Dividends on Common Stock and Interest on Subordinated Debentures 
  As a bank holding company, we are required to notify the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ( FRB ) prior to declaring and paying a dividend to stockholders during any period in which quarterly and/or cumulative twelve-month net earnings are insufficient to fund the dividend amount, among other requirements. Interest payments made by us on subordinated debentures are considered dividend payments under FRB regulations. 
   
  Liquidity 
  Liquidity Management 
  The goals of our liquidity management are to ensure the ability of the Company to meet its financial commitments when contractually due and to respond to other demands for funds such as the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors wanting to withdraw funds or borrowers who have unfunded commitments. We have an Executive Management Asset Liability Management Committee ("Executive ALM Committee"), which is comprised of members of senior management and is responsible for managing balance sheet and off-balance sheet commitments to meet the needs of customers while achieving our financial objectives. Our Executive ALM Committee meets regularly to review funding capacities, current and forecasted loan demand, and investment opportunities. 
  We manage our liquidity by maintaining pools of liquid assets on-balance sheet, consisting of cash and due from banks, interest-earning deposits in other financial institutions and unpledged investment securities available-for-sale, which we refer to as our primary liquidity. In addition, we also maintain available borrowing capacity under secured borrowing lines with the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco ( FRBSF ), which we refer to as our secondary liquidity.  In addition to its secured lines of credit, the Bank also maintains unsecured lines of credit, subject to availability, of   $80.0 million   with correspondent banks and   $99.0 million   with the FHLB, both for the purchase of overnight funds.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was a   $90.0 million   balance outstanding related to the FHLB unsecured line of credit.  In March 2016, the Bank became a member of the American Financial Exchange, through which it may either borrow or lend funds on an overnight basis with a group of pre-approved commercial banks. The availability of funds changes daily. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was a   $40.0 million   balance outstanding. 
  The following tables provide a summary of the Bank s primary and secondary liquidity levels at the dates indicated:   

65 

During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Bank s primary liquidity increased by   $189.5 million   due to a   $100.7 million   decrease in pledged securities available-for-sale, a   $59.9 million   increase in cash and due from banks, and a   $35.1 million   increase in interest-earning deposits in financial institutions.  The Bank s secondary liquidity increased by   $978.0 million   during the   third   quarter due to a   $600.2 million   increase in the borrowing capacity on the secured credit line with the FRBSF and a   $377.8 million   increase in the borrowing capacity on the secured credit line with the FHLB. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , certain qualifying loans totaling   $3.3 billion   were specifically pledged as collateral for the secured borrowing line maintained with the FRBSF. The FHLB borrowing lines are secured by a blanket lien on certain qualifying loans that are not pledged to the FRBSF. 
  In addition to our primary liquidity, the Bank generates liquidity from cash flows from our loan and securities portfolios and from our large base of core customer deposits, defined as noninterest-bearing demand, interest checking, money market, and savings accounts. At   September 30, 2016  , such core deposits totaled   $12.0 billion   and represented   77%   of the Bank's total deposits.  These core deposits are normally less volatile, often with customer relationships tied to other products offered by the Company promoting long-standing relationships and stable funding sources.  See "-Balance Sheet Analysis-  Deposits  " for additional information and detail of our core deposits. 
  Customer deposit balances may decrease if interest rates increase significantly or if corporate customers move funds from the Bank. In order to address the Bank s liquidity risk as deposit balances may fluctuate, the Bank maintains adequate levels of available liquidity. 
  Our liquidity policy establishes various liquidity guidelines for the Bank. The policy includes guidelines for On-Balance Sheet Liquidity (a measurement of primary liquidity to total deposits plus borrowings), Coverage and Crisis Coverage Ratios (measurements of liquid assets to expected short-term liquidity required for the loan and deposit portfolios under normal and stressed conditions), Loan to Funding Ratio (measurement of gross loans net of fees divided by deposits plus FHLB borrowings), Wholesale Funding Ratio (measurement of wholesale funding divided by interest-earning assets), and other guidelines developed for measuring and maintaining liquidity. As of   September 30, 2016  , all liquidity guidelines established in the liquidity policy were in compliance. 
  We use brokered deposits, the availability of which is uncertain and subject to competitive market forces and regulatory limits, for liquidity management purposes.  At   September 30, 2016  , brokered deposits totaled   $1.5 billion  , consisting of   $404.5 million   of brokered time deposits,   $1.1 billion   of non-maturity brokered sweep accounts, and   $13.3 million   of other brokered deposits.  At   December 31, 2015  , brokered deposits totaled   $1.2 billion  , consisting of   $272.5 million   of brokered time deposits,   $942.3 million   of non-maturity brokered sweep accounts, and   $15.3 million   of other brokered deposits. The amount of our brokered deposits fluctuates based on market conditions and liquidity and funding needs.  Brokered deposits are an effective source of funding due to the large amount of deposits that can be obtained in a short period of time. 
  
   66 

Holding Company Liquidity  
  The primary sources of liquidity for the holding company include dividends from the Bank, intercompany tax payments from the Bank, and our ability to raise capital, issue subordinated debt and secure outside borrowings. Our ability to obtain funds for the payment of dividends to our stockholders and for other cash requirements is largely dependent upon the Bank s earnings. The Bank is subject to restrictions under certain federal and state laws and regulations that limit its ability to transfer funds to the holding company through intercompany loans, advances or cash dividends. 
  Dividends paid by California state-chartered banks are regulated by the California Department of Business Oversight ( DBO ) under its general supervisory authority as it relates to a bank s capital requirements and the FDIC. A state bank may declare a dividend without the approval of the DBO and the FDIC as long as the total dividends declared in a calendar year do not exceed either the retained earnings or the total of net profits for three previous fiscal years less any dividends paid during such period. During the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , PacWest received   $65.0 million   and   $194.0 million   in dividends from the Bank. Since the Bank had an accumulated deficit of   $536.0 million   at   September 30, 2016  , for the foreseeable future, any dividends from the Bank to the holding company will continue to require DBO and FDIC approval. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , PacWest had   $483.3 million   in cash, of which substantially all is on deposit at the Bank. We believe this amount of cash, along with anticipated dividends from the Bank, will be sufficient to fund the holding company s cash flow needs over the next 12 months, including any stock repurchases pursuant to the Company's recently announced stock repurchase program. See "  -  Recent Events  -Stock Repurchase Program  " for additional information.  PacWest acts a source of financial strength for the Bank which can also include being a source of liquidity. 
   
  Contractual Obligations 
  The following table summarizes the known contractual obligations of the Company as of the date indicated: 

_______________________________________    
           (1) 
    Excludes purchase accounting fair value adjustments. 
              (2) 
    Excludes interest on subordinated debentures as these instruments are variable rate. 
     Long-term debt obligations include subordinated debentures. Debt obligations are also discussed in Note 7.   Borrowings and Subordinated Debentures  , in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) contained in  Item 1. Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited).  Operating lease obligations are discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . The other contractual obligations relate to our minimum liability associated with our data and item processing contract with a third-party provider, commitments to contribute capital to investments in low income housing project partnerships and private equity funds, commitments to purchase loans, and commitments under deferred compensation arrangements. 
  We believe that we will be able to meet our contractual obligations as they come due through the maintenance of adequate cash levels. We expect to maintain adequate cash levels through profitability, loan and securities repayment and maturity activity, and continued deposit gathering activities. We believe we have in place various borrowing mechanisms for both short-term and long-term liquidity needs. 
  
   67 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  Our obligations also include off-balance sheet arrangements consisting of loan and lease-related commitments, of which only a portion is expected to be funded. At   September 30, 2016  , our loan and lease-related commitments, including standby letters of credit, totaled   $4.4 billion  . The commitments, which may result in funded loans and leases, increase our profitability through net interest income when drawn. We manage our overall liquidity taking into consideration funded and unfunded commitments as a percentage of our liquidity sources. Our liquidity sources have been and are expected to be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of our lending activities. 
   
  ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  
  This analysis should be read in conjunction with text under the caption "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   2015  , which text is incorporated herein by reference. Our analysis of market risk and market-sensitive financial information contains forward-looking statements and is subject to the disclosure at the beginning of Item 2 regarding such forward-looking information. 
   
  Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange 
  We enter into foreign exchange contracts with our clients and counterparty banks primarily for the purpose of offsetting or hedging clients' transaction and economic exposures arising out of commercial transactions. We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. We recognized foreign currency translation net gains of   $0.7 million   and   $0.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . In June 2015, we hedged our Euro-denominated subordinated debentures with a cross currency swap to reduce the related foreign currency translation volatility. 
   
  Asset/Liability Management and Interest Rate Sensitivity     
  Interest Rate Risk 
  We measure our interest rate risk position, or "IRR," on at least a quarterly basis using two methods: (i) net interest income simulation analysis; and (ii) market value of equity modeling. The Executive ALM Committee and the Board Asset Liability Management Committee review the results of these analyses quarterly. If hypothetical changes to interest rates cause changes to our simulated net present value of equity and/or net interest income outside our pre established limits, we may adjust our asset and liability mix in an effort to bring our interest rate risk exposure within our established limits. 
  We evaluated the results of our net interest income simulation ("NII simulation model") and market value of equity models ("MVE model") prepared as of   September 30, 2016  , the results of which are presented below. Our NII simulation and MVE models indicate that our balance sheet is asset sensitive.  An asset sensitive profile would suggest that a sudden sustained increase in rates would result in an increase in our estimated net interest income and market value of equity, while a liability sensitive profile would suggest that these amounts would decrease. 
  Net Interest Income Simulation 
  We used a NII simulation model to measure the estimated changes in net interest income that would result over the next 12 months from immediate and sustained changes in interest rates as of   September 30, 2016  . This model is an interest rate risk management tool and the results are not necessarily an indication of our future net interest income. This model has inherent limitations and these results are based on a given set of rate changes and assumptions at one point in time. We have assumed no growth in either our total interest sensitive assets or liabilities over the next 12 months, therefore the results reflect an interest rate shock to a static balance sheet. 
  This analysis calculates the difference between net interest income forecasted using both increasing and decreasing interest rate scenarios using the forward yield curve at   September 30, 2016  . In order to arrive at the base case, we extend our balance sheet at   September 30, 2016   one year and reprice any assets and liabilities that would contractually reprice or mature during that period using the products  pricing as of   September 30, 2016  . Based on such repricing, we calculate an estimated net interest income and net interest margin. 
  
   68 

The NII simulation model is dependent upon numerous assumptions. For example, the substantial majority of our loans are variable rate, which are assumed to reprice in accordance with their contractual terms.  Some loans and investment securities include the opportunity of prepayment (embedded options) and the simulation model uses prepayment assumptions to estimate these prepayments and reinvest these proceeds at current simulated yields. Our deposit products reprice at our discretion and are assumed to reprice more slowly in a rising or declining interest rate environment and usually reprice at a rate less than the change in market rates. The effects of certain balance sheet attributes, such as fixed rate loans, variable rate loans that have reached their floors, and the volume of noninterest bearing deposits as a percentage of earning assets, impact our assumptions and consequently the results of our NII simulation model. Changes that could vary significantly from our assumptions include loan and deposit growth or contraction, changes in the mix of our earning assets or funding sources, and future asset/liability management decisions, all of which may have significant effects on our net interest income. 
  The following table presents as of   September 30, 2016  , forecasted net interest income and net interest margin for the next 12 months using the forward yield curve as the base scenario and shocking the base scenario given immediate and sustained parallel upward and downward movements in interest rates of 100, 200 and 300 basis points: 

Total base case year 1 tax equivalent NII was   $912.8 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $932.2 million   at   June 30, 2016  . The decrease in year 1 NII was due to a decrease in the yield on loans due to the payoff of higher coupon legacy loans that were replaced by new loan originations at lower coupons and an increase in the cost of deposits due to the higher forward yield curve, partially offset by higher loan income on floating rate loans due to the higher forward yield curve. 
  In addition to parallel interest rate shock scenarios, we also model various alternative rate vectors that are viewed as more likely to occur in a typical monetary policy tightening cycle. One such scenario provides for market rates to increase during the next six months in accordance with the forward yield curve and thereafter to increase by 25 basis points every six months. The expected first year NII under this alternative rising rate scenario would be approximately 0.5% higher than the base case.   
  Of the   $14.8 billion   of total loans in the portfolio,   $10.8 billion   have variable interest rate terms (excluding hybrid loans discussed below) of which   $6.7 billion   would immediately reprice at   September 30, 2016  .  
  The following table presents variable-rate loans at their floors and the amounts for which the fully-indexed rates would rise off of the floors and reprice as a result of the rate increases shown: 

69 

Additionally, certain variable-rate hybrid loans do not immediately reprice because the loans contain an initial fixed-rate period before they become variable. The cumulative amounts of hybrid loans that would switch from being fixed-rate to variable-rate because the initial fixed-rate term would expire were approximately $82 million, $273 million, and $405 million in the next one, two, and three years. Approximately   66%   of the total variable-rate loans have a LIBOR index rate. 
  Market Value of Equity 
  We measure the impact of market interest rate changes on the net present value of estimated cash flows from our assets, liabilities and off balance sheet items, defined as the market value of equity, using our MVE model. This simulation model assesses the changes in the market value of our interest sensitive financial instruments that would occur in response to an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease in market interest rates of 100, 200, and 300 basis points. This analysis assigns significant value to our noninterest-bearing deposit balances.  The projections include various assumptions regarding cash flows and interest rates and are by their nature forward looking and inherently uncertain. 
  The MVE model is an interest rate risk management tool and the results are not necessarily an indication of our actual future results. Actual results may vary significantly from the results suggested by the market value of equity table. Loan prepayments and deposit attrition, changes in the mix of our earning assets or funding sources, and future asset/liability management decisions, among others, may vary significantly from our assumptions. The base case is determined by applying various current market discount rates to the estimated cash flows from the different types of assets, liabilities and off balance sheet items existing at   September 30, 2016  . 
  The following table shows the projected change in the market value of equity for the set of rate scenarios presented as of   September 30, 2016  :   

  In comparing the   September 30, 2016   simulation results to   June 30, 2016  , our base case market value of equity has increased $225 million while our overall profile has remained relatively unchanged.  The increase in base case market value of equity was due primarily to a $144 million increase in the fair value of loans and leases due to lower discount rates used for the valuation, a $50 million increase in the fair value of non-maturity deposits due to increased volume and higher market discount rates, and the $31 million net increase in stockholders' equity during the quarter.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out by the Company's management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
  There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
   
  PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
            The information set forth in Note 8.   Commitments and Contingencies   in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) is incorporated herein by reference. 
  In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we are party to various legal actions, which we believe are incidental to the operation of our business. The outcome of such legal actions and the timing of ultimate resolution are inherently difficult to predict. In the opinion of management, based upon information currently available to us, any resulting liability, in addition to amounts already accrued, and taking into consideration insurance which may be applicable, would not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial statements or operations. 
   
  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
  For information regarding factors that could affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, see the risk   f  actors disclosed in the "Risk Factors" section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

Exhibit 

PACWEST BANCORP  STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN  STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT 
  [insert date]  
  1.       Definitions  .  Unless otherwise defined herein, the terms defined in the PacWest Bancorp 2003 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the "Plan") shall have the same defined meanings in this Stock Award Agreement ( Agreement ) and the Notice of Stock Award Grant attached hereto as Appendix A. 
  2.       Grant of Stock Award  .  Pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Notice of Stock Award Grant, this Agreement, and the Plan, PacWest Bancorp (the "Company") grants to the grantee named in the Notice of Stock Award Grant ("Grantee") on the date of grant set forth in the Notice of Stock Award Grant ("Date of Grant") the number of Shares set forth in the Notice of Stock Award Grant.  This Stock Award is intended to be a Restricted Stock Award or a Performance Stock Award, as provided in the Notice of Stock Award Grant. 
  3.       Vesting  .  The Grantee shall vest in the Granted Stock in accordance with the vesting schedule provided for in the Notice of Stock Award Grant; provided, however, that the Grantee shall cease vesting in the Granted Stock on the Grantee's Termination Date or the date on which the Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors (the  Administrator ) determines that the performance goals, if any, provided for in the Notice of Stock Award Grant were not satisfied during the designated period of time.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the occurrence of a Vesting Event, the Grantee shall become 100% vested in those shares of Granted Stock that are outstanding on the date of the Vesting Event. 
  4.       Risk of Forfeiture  . 
  (a)       General Rule  .  The Granted Stock shall initially be subject to a Risk of Forfeiture.  The Shares subject to a Risk of Forfeiture shall be referred to herein as "Restricted Shares".     
  (b)       Lapse of Risk of Forfeiture  .  The Risk of Forfeiture shall lapse as the Grantee vests in the Granted Stock. 
  (c)       Forfeiture of Granted Stock; [Clawback]  .  The Restricted Shares shall automatically be forfeited and immediately returned to the Company on the Grantee's Termination Date or the date on which the Administrator determines that the performance goals, if any, provided for in the Notice of Stock Award Grant were not satisfied during the designated period of time.  [In consideration of the grant of this Stock Award, the Grantee agrees that this Stock Award and any Restricted Shares and Granted Stock hereunder (and/or other consideration awarded in settlement of this Stock Award) will be subject to forfeiture and/or repayment to the extent provided for in the PacWest Bancorp Clawback Policy, as in effect from time to time, if it is determined in accordance with the policy that a Clawback Event (as defined in such policy) has occurred.] 
  (d)       Additional Shares or Substituted Securities  .  In the event of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination or reclassification of the Common Stock or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued and outstanding Shares effected without receipt of consideration by the Company, any new, substituted or additional securities or other property (including money paid other than as an ordinary cash dividend) which are by reason of such transaction distributed with respect to any Restricted Shares or into which such Restricted Shares thereby become convertible shall immediately be subject to a Risk of Forfeiture, which Risk of Forfeiture shall lapse at the same time and in the same manner as the Risk of Forfeiture to which the corresponding Restricted Share is subject.   
  (e)       Escrow  .  Upon issuance, the stock certificates for Granted Stock shall be deposited in escrow with the Company to be held in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.  Any new, substituted or additional securities or other property described in Subsection (d) above shall immediately be delivered to the Company to be held in escrow, but only to the extent the shares of Granted Stock are at the time Restricted Shares.  All regular cash dividends on Restricted Shares (or other securities at the time held in escrow) shall be paid directly to the Grantee and shall not be held in escrow (such distributions may, however, be delivered to an address at the Company for delivery to the Grantee).  Restricted Shares, together with any other assets or securities held in escrow hereunder, shall  

be (i) surrendered to the Company for cancellation upon forfeiture of the Restricted Shares; or (ii) released to the Grantee upon the Grantee s request to the Administrator on or after the date the shares of Granted Stock are no longer Restricted Shares.  Grantee agrees not to make a request to the Company s transfer agent for delivery of any share certificates representing any shares of Granted Stock so long as such shares are Restricted Shares. 
  5.       Rights as a Stockholder  .  The Grantee shall have the rights of a stockholder with respect to the dividends paid by the Company.  Grantee shall not be entitled to vote any unvested shares of Granted Stock.  Upon the vesting of any portion of the Stock Award, the Grantee shall have the voting rights with respect to any such vested shares of Granted Stock.   
  6.       Non-transferability of Stock Award  .  Except as otherwise provided for in the Plan, this Stock Award may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Grantee, only by the Grantee.  If the Grantee transfers all or part of this Stock Award pursuant to the previous sentence, then the terms of this Agreement, the Plan and the Notice of Stock Award shall apply to the transferee to the same extent as to the Grantee. 
  7.       Regulatory Compliance  .  The issuance of Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to full compliance with all then applicable requirements of law and the requirements of any stock exchange or interdealer quotation system upon which the Common Stock may be listed or traded. 
  8.       Modification and Termination  .  The rights of the Grantee are subject to modification and termination in certain events, as provided in the Plan. 
  9.       Withholding Tax  .  The Company's obligation to deliver Shares or remove any restrictive legends upon vesting of such Shares under the Plan shall be subject to the satisfaction of all applicable federal, state and local income and employment tax withholding requirements.  The Grantee shall pay to the Company an amount equal to the withholding amount (or the Company may withhold such amount from the Grantee's salary) in cash.  In the Administrator's sole discretion, the Grantee may pay the withholding amount with Shares (including previously vested Granted Stock); provided, however, that payment in Shares shall be limited to the withholding amount calculated using the minimum statutory withholding rates, in accordance with applicable withholding requirements. 
  10.       Nondisclosure  .  Grantee acknowledges that the grant and terms of this Stock Award are confidential and may not be disclosed by Grantee to any other person, including other employees of the Company and other participants in the Plan, without the express written consent of the Company's Chief Executive Officer.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Grantee may disclose the grant and terms of this Stock Award to the Grantee's family member, financial advisor, and attorney and as may be required by law or regulation.  Any breach of this provision will be deemed to be a material breach of this Agreement. 
  11.       Governing Law  .  This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the internal laws of the State of California without regard to principles of conflict of laws. 
  12.       Successors  .  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their legal representatives, heirs, and permitted transferees, successors and assigns. 
    
  13.       Plan  .  This Agreement and the Notice of Stock Award Grant are subject to all of the terms and provisions of the Plan, receipt of a copy of which is hereby acknowledged by the Grantee.  The Grantee hereby agrees to accept as binding, conclusive, and final all decisions and interpretations of the Administrator upon any questions arising under the Plan, this Agreement, and the Notice of Stock Award Grant. 
  14.       Rights to Future Employment  .  This Stock Award does not confer upon the Grantee any right to continue in the Service of the Company or any Affiliate, nor does it limit the right of the Company to terminate the Service of the Grantee at any time. 
  15.       Entire Agreement  .  The Notice of Stock Award Grant, this Agreement, and the Plan constitute the entire contract between the parties hereto with regard to the subject matter hereof.  They supersede any other agreements, representations or understandings (whether oral or written and whether express or implied) between the parties which relate to the subject matter hereof.

PACWEST BANCORP  STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN  STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT      
  [insert date]     
  1.   Definitions.   Unless otherwise defined herein, the terms defined in the PacWest Bancorp 2003 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the  Plan ) shall have the same defined meanings in this Stock Unit Award Agreement ( Agreement ) and the Notice of Stock Unit Award Grant attached hereto as Appendix A. 
  2.   Grant of Stock Unit Award.   Pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Notice of Stock Unit Award Grant, this Agreement, and the Plan, PacWest Bancorp (the  Company ) grants to the grantee named in the Notice of Stock Unit Award Grant ( Grantee ) on the date of grant set forth in the Notice of Stock Unit Award Grant ( Date of Grant ) the number of Units set forth in the Notice of Stock Unit Award Grant. This Stock Unit Award is intended to be a Performance Stock Unit Award, and each  Unit  shall represent an unfunded, unsecure promise by the Company to deliver you one share of Common Stock for each Unit that vests. 
  3.   Vesting.   The Grantee shall vest in the Units in accordance with the vesting schedule provided for in the Notice of Stock Unit Award Grant; provided, however, that the Grantee shall cease vesting in the Units on the Grantee s Termination Date or the date on which the Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors (the  Administrator ) determines that the performance goals provided for in the Notice of Stock Unit Award Grant were not satisfied during the designated period of time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the occurrence of a Vesting Event, the Grantee shall become 100% vested in the Units that are outstanding on the date of the Vesting Event, provided, however, that in the event of the death of a Participant, any outstanding Units (1) shall be deemed earned at the target level with respect to all open performance periods if death occurs during the performance period, and (2) shall be deemed earned at the actual performance level achieved if death occurs after the end of the performance period. 
  4.   Risk of Forfeiture. 
  (a)   General Rule.   The Units shall initially be subject to a Risk of Forfeiture. The Units subject to a Risk of Forfeiture shall be referred to herein as  Restricted Share Units . 
  (b)   Lapse of Risk of Forfeiture.   The Risk of Forfeiture shall lapse as the Grantee vests in the Units. 
  (c)   Forfeiture of Units.   The Restricted Share Units shall automatically be forfeited without payment or consideration on the Grantee s Termination Date or the date on which the Administrator determines that the performance goals provided for in the Notice of Stock Unit Award Grant were not satisfied during the designated period of time. 

(d)   Adjustments  .  The Units will be subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of Section 11(a) of the Plan. 
  (e)   Clawback  .  In consideration of this grant of Units, the Grantee agrees that the Agreement and any Units hereunder (and/or other consideration awarded in settlement of the Units) will be subject to forfeiture and/or repayment to the extent provided for in the PacWest Bancorp Clawback Policy, as in effect from time to time, if it is determined in accordance with the policy that a Clawback Event (as defined in such policy) has occurred. 
  5.   Rights as a Stockholder.   The Grantee will not be paid any dividends during the performance period and instead any dividends paid by the Company during the performance period that would have been paid upon any Shares in respect of your Stock Unit Award had such Shares been issued at the time dividends were paid will be paid out at the time the Shares are delivered based on the actual number of Shares delivered. Grantee shall not be deemed to be the holder of Shares underlying the Stock Unit Award, and shall not have any of the rights of a stockholders with respect to such Shares underlying the Stock Unit Award unless and until the Company shall have issued and delivered Shares to the Grantee and the Grantee s name shall have been entered as a stockholder of record on the books of the Company. 
  6.   Non-transferability of Stock Unit Award.   Except as otherwise provided for in the Plan, this Stock Unit Award may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and any Stock Unit Award rights may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Grantee, only by the Grantee. If the Grantee transfers all or part of this Stock Unit Award pursuant to the previous sentence, then the terms of this Agreement, the Plan and the Notice of Stock Unit Award shall apply to the transferee to the same extent as to the Grantee. 
  7.   Regulatory Compliance.   The issuance of Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to full compliance with all then applicable requirements of law and the requirements of any stock exchange or interdealer quotation system upon which the Common Stock may be listed or traded. 
  8.   Modification and Termination.   The rights of the Grantee are subject to modification and termination in certain events, as provided in the Plan. 
  9.   Withholding Tax.   The Company s obligation to deliver Shares under the Plan shall be subject to the satisfaction of all applicable federal, state and local income and employment tax withholding requirements. The Grantee shall pay to the Company an amount equal to the withholding amount (or the Company may withhold such amount from the Grantee s salary) in cash. In the Administrator s sole discretion, the Grantee may pay the withholding amount with Shares (including previously vested stock); provided, however, that payment in Shares shall be limited to the withholding amount calculated using the minimum statutory withholding rates, in accordance with applicable withholding requirements. 

10.   Nondisclosure.   Grantee acknowledges that the grant and terms of this Stock Unit Award are confidential and may not be disclosed by Grantee to any other person, including other employees of the Company and other participants in the Plan, without the express written consent of the Company s Chief Executive Officer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Grantee may disclose the grant and terms of this Stock Unit Award to the Grantee s family member, financial advisor, and attorney and as may be required by law or regulation.

  14.   Rights to Future Employment.   This Stock Unit Award does not confer upon the Grantee any right to continue in the Service of the Company or any Affiliate, nor does it limit the right of the Company to terminate the Service of the Grantee at any time. 
  15.   Entire Agreement.   The Notice of Stock Unit Award Grant, this Agreement, and the Plan constitute the entire contract between the parties hereto with regard to the subject matter hereof. They supersede any other agreements, representations or understandings (whether oral or written and whether express or implied) between the parties which relate to the subject matter hereof.
