Notes to Condensed Financial Statements  

Note 1.  Nature of Operations  

Banyan Rail Services, Inc. (the  Company )
was originally organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1985, under the name VMS Hotel Investment Trust,
for the purpose of investing in mortgage loans, principally to entities affiliated with VMS Realty Partners. The Company was subsequently
reorganized as a Delaware corporation in 1987 and changed its name to B.H.I.T. Inc. In 2010, the Company changed its name from
B.H.I.T. Inc. to Banyan Rail Services Inc. From 2009 to 2012, the Company operated and experienced severe losses from an operating
subsidiary in the rail services sector and is now a shell company. 

The Company is actively seeking acquisitions
of leading companies within the transportation and medical office real estate industries throughout North America. 

Liquidity and Going Concern (See Note 4) 
The Company s ability to continue on a going-concern basis is dependent upon, among other things, raising capital and finding
an operating business to acquire, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. 

Note 2.  Basis of Presentation  

The unaudited condensed financial statements and notes included
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The interim condensed consolidated financial information herein
is unaudited. The information reflects all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation
of the financial position and results of operations for the periods included in this report. 

Note 3.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. 

Cash  

The Company considers all cash, bank deposits
and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash. From time to time our cash deposits
exceed federally insured limits. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

Recorded financial instruments as of September
30, 2016, consist of cash, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued liabilitiesand short-term obligations. The related fair
values of these financial instruments approximated their carrying values due to either the short-term nature of these instruments
or based on the interest rates currently available to the Company. 

(Loss) Per Common Share  

The Company computes net loss per common share in accordance with
the provision included in ASC 260,  Earnings per Share  ( ASC 260 ). Under ASC 260, basic and diluted income per
share is computed by dividing net loss available to shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares and common share
equivalents outstanding during the period. Basic loss per common share excludes the effect of potentially dilutive securities,
while diluted loss per common share reflects the potential dilution that would occur if securities or other contracts to issue
common shares were exercised for, converted into or otherwise resulted in the issuance of common shares. 

Page  7  of 19 

Income Taxes  

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance
with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, as clarified by ASC 740-10, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.  Under
this method, deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial
statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws. 

Deferred income tax provisions and benefits
are based on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year. In providing for deferred taxes, the Company considers tax
regulations of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, estimates of future taxable income, and available tax planning
strategies. If tax regulations, operating results or the ability to implement tax-planning strategies vary, adjustments to the
carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required. Valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax
assets based on the  more likely than not  criteria of ASC 740. 

ASC 740-10 requires that the Company recognize
the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than
not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the  more-likely-than-not  threshold, the amount
recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized
upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. 

Retained Earnings distributions  

The Company s preferred stockholders
are entitled to receive payment before any of the common stockholders upon a liquidation of the Company and we cannot pay dividends
on our common stock unless we first pay dividends required by our preferred stock. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

During 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (the  FASB ) has issued Accounting Standards Updates ( ASUs ) 2016-01 through 2016-17. Except for
ASU 2016-02, 2016-09, and 2016-15, which are discussed below, these ASUs provide technical corrections or simplification to existing
guidance and to specialized industries or entities and therefore have minimal, if any, impact on the Company. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
Leases (Topic 842). This ASU requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet. The provisions of this ASU are effective
for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. The
Company is evaluating the requirements of this ASU and has not yet determined the impact of the adoption on the Company s
financial position or results of operations. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,
Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The objective of this
ASU is to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences,
classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted
for any entity in any interim or annual period. The will not have a material impact on the Company s condensed financial
statements. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,
Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This ASU addresses how certain
cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230, Statement of Cash
Flows, and other Topics. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December
15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The implementation of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s
financial statements. 

Note 4. Liquidity and Going Concern   

At and for the period ended September 30,
2016, the Company had a net working capital deficit of $505,212 and incurred negative cash flows from operating activities of $542,373.
The Company s future liquidity and capital requirements are dependent upon many factors, including our ability to identify
and complete acquisitions as well as the success of any business we do acquire. We may need to raise additional funds in order
to meet working capital requirements, make additional capital expenditures or to take advantage of other opportunities. We cannot
be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all. If we are unable to raise needed capital,
our growth may be impeded. In addition, if we raise capital by selling additional shares of stock, the percentage ownership of
current Banyan shareholders will be diluted.

Note 5. Preferred Stock and Common Stock

Preferred stock dividends for Series A Preferred
stock have been recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, in the amount of $25,945 and $77,820, respectively.
During 2012, due to the lack of cash flow, the Company offered to pay the accrued dividends in common stock in lieu of cash. In
February of 2016, we issued 29,856 shares of common stock in lieu of $29,249 of cash dividends for dividends accrued through December
31, 2015. Substantially all preferred shareholders accepted the common stock in lieu of cash and the common shares for these dividends. 

On August 8,
2016, the Company issued an aggregate of 220,000 shares of common stock to Donald S. Denbo, Paul S. Dennis, Mark L. Friedman, Gary
O. Marino, and Jon D. Ryan as compensation for services as directors in 2016. The Company recorded compensation expense in the
amount (included in general and administrative on the Condensed Statement of Operations) of $165,000 for the value of their services
as of September 30, 2016. The compensation expense is based on the $0.75 a share market price of the Company s stock at the
time of issuance as required by applicable accounting guidance. However, the Company used a per share price of $0.25 in calculating
the number of shares to issue to the board members due to: (i) the thinly traded nature of the Company s stock; and (ii)
the shares being unregistered and subject to Rule 144 resale restrictions.  The issuance of the shares was made in reliance
on Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 for the offer and sale of securities not involving a public offering and Rule 506
of Regulation D of the Securities Act. 

As of September 30, 2016, Banyan Rail Holdings
LLC ( Banyan Holdings ) and Marino Family Holdings LLC owned 2,726,114 and 3,057,778 shares of common stock, respectively. 

Note 6. Income Taxes    

For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded an income tax provision of $0. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 0%. The tax rate differs from the statutory federal rate of 34% primarily due to valuation allowances
recorded on the Company s net operating loss carry forward generated during the period. The Company recorded an operating
loss for the quarter and has a recent history of operating losses. After assessing the realization of the net deferred tax assets,
we have recorded a valuation allowance of 100% of the value of the net deferred tax assets, as we believe it more likely than not
that the Company will not realize operating profits and taxable income so as to utilize all of the net operating losses in the
future. 

Note 7. (Loss) per Share  

The Company excluded from the diluted earnings
per share calculation 103,750 shares issuable upon conversion of shares of convertible preferred stock that were outstanding at
September 30, 2016 and 2015, as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. In addition, the Company excluded 5,000 stock options as
of September 30, 2015, which subsequently expired in July 2016 as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. 

Note 8.  Stock-Based Compensation  

The Company previously had stock option agreements
with its directors and officers for serving on the Company s Board of Directors and as officers. The options activity is
as follows: 

Page  9  of 19 

On July 1, 2010, at its annual meeting of
stockholders, the 2010 Stock Option and Award Plan was approved. 

The fair values of stock options are estimated
using the Black-Scholes method, which takes into account variables such as estimated volatility, expected holding period, dividend
yield, and the risk free interest rate. The risk free interest rate is the five year treasury rate at the date of grant. The expected
life is based on the contractual life of the options at the date of grant. 

Note 9. Related Party Transactions  

On June 1, 2015, the Company entered into
a month-to-month office lease and administrative support agreement (the  Agreement ) with Boca Equity Partners LLC
( BEP ). The Agreement is effective as of January 1, 2015. The Agreement provides for the Company s use of a
portion of BEP s offices and certain overhead items at the BEP offices such as space, utilities and other administrative
services for $4,750 a month. 

Also on June 1, 2015, the Company entered
into a support agreement (the  Support Agreement ) with BEP. The Support Agreement is effective as of January 1, 2015,
and provides for corporate support services. The Support Agreement is for a month-to-month term and will terminate upon the Company s
payment of a success fee, should the Company acquire more than 50% of the assets or capital stock of any company (an  Acquisition )
during the term of the Support Agreement or within the one year period following the termination of the Support Agreement. Within
five days of the closing of any potential Acquisition, Banyan will pay to BEP 2% of the cash purchase price paid by the Company
to the seller(s) for the Acquisition. 

Gary O. Marino, the Company s chairman
of the board, is the chairman, president, and chief executive officer of BEP. Gary O. Marino and directors Donald S. Denbo and
Paul S. Dennis also hold membership interests in BEP. 

On July 27, 2016, the Company entered into
a Demand Note and Loan Agreement (the  Note ) with  BEP  providing for draws of up to $250,000. Loans under the
Note bear interest at an annual rate of 10% and outstanding principal and interest are due on demand. Gary O. Marino, the Company s
chairman of the board, is the chairman, president, and chief executive officer of BEP. Mr. Marino and directors Donald S. Denbo
and Paul S. Dennis also hold membership interests in BEP. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had a balance outstanding on the
Note of $250,000 and incurred additional advances of $25,000 from BEP for a total outstanding of $275,000 as of September 30, 2016. 

The Company s directors are currently
not receiving cash compensation for their services but were compensated through the issuance of common shares, see  Note 5. Preferred
Stock and Common Stock.  

The Company s board of directors and
officers directly or beneficially own 7,092,375 shares of common stock as of September 30, 2016.

Item 2.  Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking
Statements 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains
information about us, some of which includes  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are statements other than historical information or statements about
our current condition. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of terms such as  believes,   contemplates, 
 expects,   may,   will,   could,   should,   would,  or
 anticipates,  other similar phrases, or the negatives of these terms. We have based the forward-looking statements
relating to our operations on our current expectations, estimates and projections about us and the markets we serve. We caution
you that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements should
be considered in conjunction with the discussion in Part I, the information set forth under Item 1A,  Risk Factors 
and with the discussion of the business included in Part II, Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations,  of our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed on March 22, 2016. We have based many
of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual
outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Any differences
could result from a variety of factors, including the following: 

successfully raising capital to fund our operations;   

successfully finding an operating entity to acquire;   

complying with SEC regulations and filing requirements applicable to us as a public company; and   

any of our other plans, objectives, expectations and intentions contained in this report that are
not historical facts.   

You should not place undue reliance on our
forward-looking statements, which reflect our analysis only as of the date of this report. The risks and uncertainties listed above
and elsewhere in this report and other documents that we file with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q, and any current reports on Form 8-K, must be carefully considered by any investor or potential investor in
the Company. 

Overview   

Banyan Rail Services, Inc. (the  Company )
is a shell company without significant operations or sources of revenues other than its investments. Our management team is aggressively
investigating potential operating companies to acquire and additional sources of financing. Currently we are actively seeking acquisitions
of leading companies within the transportation and medical office real estate industries throughout North America, but we cannot
guarantee we will complete an acquisition in any of these industries. Accordingly, we may explore potential acquisitions in other
industries. 

Our History 

The Company was originally organized under
the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1985, for the purpose of investing in mortgage loans. The Company was reorganized
as a Delaware corporation in 1987. From 1989 to 1992 the Company experienced severe losses as a result of a decline in real estate
values and the resulting defaults on the mortgages it held. In 1998, the Company changed its name to B.H.I.T. Inc., and again changed
its name to Banyan Rail Services Inc. in 2010. 

On January 24, 2007, a group of private investors
purchased 41.7% of our outstanding shares held by our largest shareholder at the time. Because members of our new management team
have experience with the railroad industry, we began investigating acquisitions of companies in the rail industry. In the spring
of 2009, we entered negotiations with the owners of The Wood Energy Group Inc. ( Wood Energy ) to acquire the company.
As a result of the acquisition of Wood Energy, we were no longer a shell company. On January 4, 2010, we changed our name to Banyan
Rail Services Inc. to reflect our new business. As a result of the bankruptcy and liquidation of Wood Energy, Banyan is now a shell
Company seeking to acquire an operating entity.

of BEP. Mr. Marino and directors Donald S. Denbo and Paul S. Dennis also hold membership interests in BEP. As of September 30,
2016, the Company had a balance outstanding on the Note of $250,000 and incurred additional advances of $25,000 from BEP for a
total outstanding of $275,000 as of September 30, 2016. 

Stock Issuance  

On August 8, 2016, the Company issued an aggregate
of 220,000 shares of common stock to Donald S. Denbo, Paul S. Dennis, Mark L. Friedman, Gary O. Marino, and Jon D. Ryan as compensation
for services as a director in 2016. The Company recorded compensation expense in the amount (included in general and administrative
on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations) of $165,000 for the value of their services as of September 30, 2016. The
compensation expense is based on the $0.75 a share market price of the Company s stock at the time of issuance as required
by applicable accounting guidance. However, the Company used a per share price of $0.25 in calculating the number of shares to
issue to the board members due to: (i) the thinly traded nature of the Company s stock; and (ii) the shares being unregistered
and subject to Rule 144 resale restrictions. The issuance of the Shares was made in reliance on Section 4(2) of the Securities
Act of 1933 for the offer and sale of securities not involving a public offering and Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities
Act.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

The following discussion and analysis of our
results of operations and financial condition is based upon our condensed financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires
us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities, if any, at the date of the financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience
and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. If these estimates differ materially from
actual results, the impact on our condensed financial statements may be material. 

We review our financial reporting and disclosure
practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current
economic and business environment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were no significant changes to the critical
accounting policies. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. 

Cash  

The Company considers all cash, bank deposits
and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

Recorded financial instruments at September
30, 2016 consist of cash, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued expenses and short-term obligations. The related fair values
of these financial instruments approximated their carrying values due to either the short-term nature of these instruments or based
on the interest rates currently available to the Company. 

(Loss)  Per Common Share  

The Company computes net loss per common share
in accordance with the provision included in ASC 260, Earnings per Share ( ASC 260 ). Under ASC 260, basic and diluted
income per share is computed by dividing net loss available to shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares and
common share equivalents outstanding during the period. Basic loss per common share excludes the effect of potentially dilutive
securities, while diluted loss per common share reflects the potential dilution that would occur if securities or other contracts
to issue common shares were exercised for, converted into or otherwise resulted in the issuance of common shares. 

Page  14  of 19 

Income Taxes  

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance
with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, as clarified by ASC 740-10, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.  Under
this method, deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial
statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws. 

Deferred income tax provisions and benefits
are based on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year. In providing for deferred taxes, the Company considers tax
regulations of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, estimates of future taxable income, and available tax planning
strategies. If tax regulations, operating results or the ability to implement tax-planning strategies vary, adjustments to the
carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required. Valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax
assets based on the  more likely than not  criteria of ASC 740. 

ASC 740-10 requires that the Company recognize
the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than
not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the  more-likely-than-not  threshold, the amount
recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized
upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. 

Retained Earnings Distributions  

The Company s preferred stockholders
are entitled to receive payment before any of the common stockholders upon a liquidation of the Company and we cannot pay dividends
on our common stock unless we first pay dividends required by our preferred stock. 

Results from Operations   

The following table summarizes our results for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

General and Administrative Expenses  

General and administrative expenses include:
compensation, professional fees and costs related to being a public company. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
costs decreased $319,975, or 33.1% compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

The overall decrease in general and administrative
costs is primarily due to: 

Offset by an increase in pursued deal costs of approximately $44,000,   

An increase in insurance expense of approximately $3,000, and   

An increase in public company costs of approximately $7,000.   

For the three months ended September 30, 2016,
costs decreased $337,227 or 50.0% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Page  15  of 19 

The overall decrease in general and administrative
costs is primarily due to: 

Offset by an increase in pursued deal costs of approximately $50,000, and   

An increase in insurance expenses of approximately $3,000.   

Income Tax Expense  

A valuation allowance offsets net deferred
tax assets for which future realization is considered to be less likely than not. A valuation allowance is evaluated by considering
all positive and negative evidence about whether the deferred tax assets will be realized. At the time of evaluation, the allowance
can be either increased or reduced. A reduction could result in the complete elimination of the allowance, if positive evidence
indicates that the value of the deferred tax assets is no longer impaired and the allowance is no longer required. 

The Company recorded an operating loss for
the quarter, and has a recent history of operating losses. After assessing the realization of the net deferred tax assets, we have
recorded a valuation allowance of 100% of the value of the net deferred tax assets as we currently believe it more likely than
not that the Company will not realize operating profits and taxable income so as to utilize all of the net operating losses in
the near future. 

Net (Loss)  

Net loss attributable to common stockholders
was $0.04 and $0.07 per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to net loss of $0.07 and $0.14
per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The change was primarily the result of a decrease in net loss
attributable to common stockholders as describe above and an increase in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the periods respectively. 

Financial Condition and Liquidity 

Our cash balance at September 30, 2016 and
2015 was $60,009 and $458,392, respectively. 

The following is a summary of our cash flow
activity: 

Net cash used in operating activities  

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash used in operating
activities was $542,373 as compared to $459,009 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The primary use of cash was to fund
the normal operating activities of the Company and acquisition related costs. 

Net cash provided by financing activities  

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
net cash provided by financing activities of $275,000 was provided by a related party demand loan. For the nine months ended September
30, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $515,000, which was provided by the sale of common stock. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company had net
working capital deficit of $505,212 as compared to net working capital of $27,476 at December 31, 2015. The decrease in working
capital is the result of normal operations of the Company in 2016 and acquisition related costs. 

Page  16  of 19 

The Company recognizes that as a result of
the lack of operations and cash flow that it will have to rely upon sales of stock or future capital contributions from investors
to generate cash flow for the foreseeable future. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any material off-balance sheet
arrangements.
