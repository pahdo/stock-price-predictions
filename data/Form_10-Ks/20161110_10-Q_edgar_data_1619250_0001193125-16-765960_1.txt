     Valeritas Holdings, Inc.   
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   
  (Unaudited)      1. Nature of Operations
and Organization     Valeritas Holdings, Inc. (formerly Cleaner Yoga Mat, Inc.) was incorporated in Florida on May 9, 2014 and was previously engaged
in the sale of sanitizing solutions for Yoga and Pilates studios as well of conventional gyms of all sizes. Valeritas Holdings, Inc. was then reincorporated in Delaware on May 3, 2016.  
 As used in these Notes, the terms  Valeritas  and the  private company  refer to the business of Valeritas, Inc. prior to the 2016 Merger,
the term  Valeritas Holdings, Inc.  or the  Company  refers to the combination of Valeritas and Valeritas Holdings, Inc. after giving retrospective effect to the recapitalization under the 2016 Merger.  
 Valeritas was incorporated in the state of Delaware on December 27, 2007 when it was converted into a Delaware Corporation from a Delaware limited
liability company, which was formed on August 2, 2006 and changed its name from Valeritas LLC. The Company is a commercial-stage medical technology company focused on developing innovative technologies to improve the health and quality of life
of people with Type 2 diabetes. The Company designed its first commercialized product, the V-Go Disposable Insulin Delivery device, or V-Go, to help patients with Type 2 diabetes who require insulin to achieve and maintain their target blood glucose
goals. V-Go is a small, discreet, easy-to-use wearable and completely disposable insulin delivery device that a patient adheres to his or her skin every 24 hours. V-Go enables patients to closely mimic the body s normal physiologic pattern of
insulin delivery throughout the day and to manage their diabetes with insulin without the need to plan a daily routine around multiple daily injections.  
   2016 Reverse Merger and Recapitalization      On
May 3, 2016, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the  Merger Agreement ), by and among Valeritas Holdings, Inc., Valeritas Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of
Valeritas Holdings, Inc. (the  Acquisition Subsidiary ) and Valeritas, Inc., Acquisition Subsidiary was merged with and into Valeritas, with Valeritas being the surviving entity and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Valeritas Holdings, Inc.
(the  2016 Merger ). Immediately prior to the 2016 Merger, all shares of common stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series AA Preferred Stock, and shares underlying common stock options and shares underlying the warrants were canceled without
consideration. Concurrent with the 2016 merger, the shares of Valeritas private company Series AB Preferred Stock were canceled and each share of private company Series AB Preferred Stock of Valeritas was replaced with 0.23856 shares of common stock
of Valeritas Holdings, Inc.    Upon the closing of the Merger, under the terms of a split-off agreement and a general release agreement, Valeritas Holdings,
Inc. transferred all of its pre-Merger operating assets and liabilities to its wholly owned special purpose subsidiary ( Split-Off Subsidiary ), and transferred all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Split-Off Subsidiary to the
pre-Merger majority stockholder of Valeritas Holdings, Inc. (the  Split-Off ), in consideration of and in exchange for (i) the surrender and cancellation of 40,486,000 shares of Valeritas Holdings, Inc. common stock held by such
stockholder (which will be cancelled and will resume the status of authorized but unissued shares of Valeritas Holdings, Inc. common stock) and (ii) certain representations, covenants and indemnities.  
 The Merger is being accounted for as a  reverse merger,  and Valeritas is deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the reverse merger. The historical
financial statements of the Valeritas Holding, Inc. prior to the 2016 Merger have been replaced with the historical financial statements of Valeritas.  
 Amounts for Valeritas historical (pre-merger) common stock, preferred stock, warrants, and stock options including share and per share amounts have been
retroactively adjusted using their respective exchange ratio in these financial statements, unless otherwise disclosed. Any amounts funded in connection with the original issuance of the common stock, Series D Preferred Stock and Series AA Preferred
Stock have been retrospectively adjusted and accounted for as capital contributions as those classes of Valeritas stock did not receive common shares of Valeritas Holdings, Inc. in connection with the 2016 Merger. All shares of Valeritas private
company Series AB Preferred Stock have been retrospectively adjusted to common stock of Valeritas Holdings, Inc. based upon the exchange ratio noted above.  
  2. Liquidity, Uncertainties and Going Concern     The
Company is subject to a number of risks similar to those of early stage commercial companies, including dependence on key individuals, the difficulties inherent in the development of a commercial market, the potential need to obtain additional
capital necessary to fund the development of its products, and competition from larger companies. The Company expects that its sales performance and the resulting operating income or loss, as well as the status of each of its new product development
programs, will significantly impact its cash requirements.  
      7  

Table of Contents  

  The Company has incurred losses each year since inception and has experienced negative cash flows from operations
in each year since inception. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $15.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and an accumulated deficit of $414.4 million. The Company s restructured Term Loan includes a liquidity covenant whereby the
Company must maintain a cash balance greater than $5.0 million. The Company s cash balance will not be sufficient to satisfy the Company s operations for the next 12 months from September 30, 2016 or maintain its liquidity covenant,
which raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company estimates that the cash balance will be sufficient to satisfy the Company s operations into mid-first quarter of 2017.  
 The Company expects that its actual sales performance and the resulting operating income or loss, as well as the status of each of its new product development
programs, will significantly impact their cash management. The Company intends to maintain compliance with the liquidity covenant and fund future operations by raising additional capital. There can be no assurances that financing will be available
on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. If the Company is unable to raise capital prior to achieving sustained profitability from operations, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.     3. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies   
   Basis of Presentation      The accompanying unaudited
consolidated financial statements were prepared using generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, these unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements do not include all information or notes required by generally accepted accounting principles for annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction in Valeritas Holdings, Inc. s 2015 annual consolidated financial
statements included within the Form 8-K/A filed by the Company on May 16, 2016.    The preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements; and the reported amounts of expenses during the reported period. Ultimate results could differ from the estimates of management.    In
the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the Company s financial position and the results of its operations and cash flows for the
interim periods presented. Such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 may not be indicative of results for the full year.  
   Significant Accounting Policies      There have been
no material changes to the significant accounting policies previously disclosed in Valeritas Holdings, Inc. s 2015 annual consolidated financial statements included within the Form 8-K/A filed by the Company on May 16, 2016.  
   Recent Accounting Pronouncements      In April, 2016,
the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying performance obligations and licensing , effective January 1, 2018, to reduce the cost and complexity of applying the guidance on identifying promised
goods or services around identifying performance obligations and implementation guidance on determining whether an entity s promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use the entity s intellectual property (which
is satisfied at a point in time) or a right to access the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied over time). The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor have they determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing
financial reporting, if any.    In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases . ASU 2016-2 sets out the principles for the
recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on
the principle of whether or not the lease effectively finances a purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method (finance lease) or on a straight line basis over
the term of the lease (operating lease). A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less
will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. ASU 2016-2 supersedes the existing guidance on accounting for leases in  Leases (Topic 840).  The provisions of ASU 2016-2 are effective for fiscal years, and
interim reporting periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted and the provisions are to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of
adoption on our consolidated financial statements.

Table of Contents  

  In March, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting .
This ASU contains amendments intended to simplify various aspects of share-based payment accounting and presentation in the financial statements, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities,
treatment of forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, and classification in the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual
periods. Early adoption of this standard is permitted. The amendments requiring recognition in the income statement of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies resulting from settlements arising after the date of adoption of the new standard should
be applied prospectively. Changes relating to classification of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the statement of cash flows may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. All other amendments are to be applied retrospectively.
We have not elected early adoption of this standard. We are currently evaluating the impact this new standard will have on our financial statements.

Company reviews its inventory for excess or obsolescence and writes down inventory that has no alternative uses to its net realizable value. The inventory reserves at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $1.7 million and $2.3 million,
respectively.     5. Property and Equipment     Property
and equipment consisted of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

    7. Restructuring     In
February 2016, as part of a restructuring plan, the Company underwent a labor force reduction. The total restructuring costs are expected to be $2.7 million and consists of $1.2 million severance expense and $1.5 million of retention bonuses. The
retention bonuses were scheduled to be paid in two installments over the 12 months following the commencement of the restructuring plan. Employees entitled to the retention must remain employed with the Company in good standing for at least 6 months
after each installment payment. Otherwise, employees are obligated to repay the entire bonus received for that installment.    The Company accrues the
retention bonus monthly on a straight line basis through the retention period. See below for all activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2016:      
    8. Debt     At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had the following debt outstanding:      
 
      10  

Table of Contents  

    Presentation    
 On May 23, 2013, the Company entered into the Term Loan of $50 million with Capital Royalty Group ( CRG ), structured as a senior secured loan
with a six-year term (the  Term Loan  or the  Senior Secured Debt ). In 2015, the Company did not meet the minimum revenue covenant of $50 million contained in the Term Loan agreement. Also, the Company did not meet the capital
financing targets and was not able to maintain adequate operating cash and working capital all of which triggered the occurrence of a Material Adverse Change as stipulated within the Term Loan agreement. The Company entered into a series of
forbearance agreements as described below, which extended the repayment terms through May 3, 2016. Due to the covenant failures and an associated cross-default covenant in the $5.0 million senior subordinated note or the WCAS Note or the Other
Note Payable to WCAS Capital Partners IV, L.P., or WCAS, that refers to defaults on other debt instruments held by the Company, both debt balances were being presented as short-term debt in the Company s consolidated balance sheet at
December 31, 2015.    Concurrently with the closing of the 2016 Merger on May 3, 2016, the Company restructured its Term Loan and WCAS Note, which
extended the payment term of respective principal balance of $50 million and $5 million to March 31, 2021 and September 8, 2021, respectively. As such, the Company has classified the principal balances of debt as long-term at September 30,
2016.    During the quarter and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred non-cash interest expense of $1.6 million and $10.6
million, respectively. During the quarter and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015, the Company incurred non-cash interest expense of $3.7 million and $12.4 million, respectively.  
   Senior Secured Debt      The Term Loan is secured by
substantially all of the Company s assets, including its material intellectual property. The Term Loan bore interest at 11% per annum and compounds annually. Until the third anniversary of the Term Loan, the Company had the option to pay
quarterly interest of 7.5% in cash and 3.5% paid-in-kind, or PIK, interest which is added to the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan on the last day of each quarter. Thereafter, interest on the Term Loan was payable only in cash. The Term
Loan contained a minimum revenue covenant, which was $50.0 million for 2015.    The events of default, described previously, has led the Company to enter
into a series of forbearance agreements with CRG. The initial forbearance agreement was entered on May 18, 2015 and has subsequently been amended five times. The forbearance agreements, as amended entered in 2015, contained a number of terms
and conditions in exchange for CRG s agreement to forbear. The forbearance agreement imposed an interest rate at the default interest rate of 15% per annum and a prepayment premium of 4% on the aggregate outstanding balance on the date of
the repayment. As of December 31, 2015, the parties deferred the forbearance expiration date again to January 22, 2016. The forbearance agreements entered in 2015 and 2016 were accounted as troubled debt restructuring ( TDR ).
There was no gain associated with the TDR, however the modified effective interest rate was applied prospectively.    On January 22, 2016, the Company
and CRG amended the forbearance agreement to extend the forbearance period to March 31, 2016. As part of the terms within the forbearance agreement, dated January 29, 2016, the Company issued warrants to CRG exercisable into 16,000,000
shares of private company Series AB Preferred Stock of the Valeritas at $1.25 per share. The warrant had a term of one year. The warrant fair value at the date of issuance was determined to be $4.0 million, using Black Scholes option pricing model
(see note 9 below). The warrant was accounted for as a debt discount and amortized through to May 3, 2016, when the Term Loan was restructured.    On
March 25, 2016, the Company and CRG amended the forbearance agreement to extend the expiration of the forbearance period to April 30, 2016 and included a number of events that could trigger an earlier expiration of the forbearance
agreement. This did not result in any restructuring gain or loss and the modified effective interest rate was applied prospectively.    Concurrently with
the closing of the 2016 Merger on May 3, 2016, the Company restructured the Term Loan. CRG converted its outstanding accrued interest and prepayment premium of $16.5 million into 8,609,824 shares of private company Series AB preferred stock and
4,649,859 shares of private company common stock (see Other Note Payable for additional conversions during 2016). The private company Series AB shares were then converted into 2,053,959 of the Company s common stock upon the 2016 Merger and all
private company shares of common stock were canceled upon the 2016 Merger. The principal balance was restated as $50 million with interest rate charged at 11% per annum, which is PIK interest through June 30, 2018 and then both PIK and
cash interest thereafter. The provisions of the restructured Term Loan require quarterly interest payments during the term of the loan, which are set to commence on June 30, 2018. The repayment of principal on amounts borrowed under the Term
Loan is scheduled to be completed on March 31, 2021.

  The restructured Term Loan agreement contains a financial covenant, which requires the Company to maintain a
minimum cash balance of $5.0 million. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenant in the restructured Term Loan agreement, as we held cash and cash equivalents of $15.5 million.  
  Warrant     In 2014, the Company issued warrants to CRG to
purchase 177,347 shares of Valeritas common stock exercisable at $0.013 per share. On February 27, 2015, Valeritas issued warrants to purchase 1,802 shares of Valeritas common stock with the same exercise price and terms to those issued in
2014. Valeritas recorded the loan net of original issuance discount calculated fair value of the issued warrants. On January 29, 2016, Valeritas issued CRG additional warrants to acquire 16,000,000 private company Series AB shares at exercise
price of $1.25, which would have converted to 3,816,960 shares of common stock in the public company. The fair value of the warrant at the date of issuance is determined to be $4.0 million, which Valeritas recorded as additional debt discount and a
derivative liability.    All of the Valeritas common stock and preferred stock warrants issued to CRG were cancelled or exercised during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. The forbearance agreements entered into during 2015 and 2016, triggered a TDR and accelerated the timing of repayment of the Term Loan to January 22, 2016 which was extended during 2016 through May 3, 2016. The
Company accelerated the amortization of the debt discount associated with the private company common stock warrants through January 22, 2016 and accelerated the amortization of the debt discount associated with Valeritas Series AB preferred
stock warrants through May 3, 2016. As such, all discounts associated with warrants issued in connection with the Term Loan were fully amortized at May 3, 2016.  
  Financing costs     The Company recorded the Term Loan net
of deferred financing costs paid directly to the creditor (and therefore treated as a discount to the debt) of $500 relating to the lender finance fee of 1%. The discount related to the issuance costs is being amortized over the term of the loan
using the effective interest method. The forbearance agreements entered into during 2015 accelerated the timing of repayment of the Term Loan to January 22, 2016. The Company accelerated the amortization of the debt discount to coincide with
the forbearance period. The carrying amount of the debt discount relating to the original deferred financing costs was fully amortized at September 30, 2016.  
 In connection with the restructuring of the Term Loan on May 3, 2016, the Company incurred costs of $0.2 million which were recorded as a discount to the
Term Loan balance and will be amortized through the term of the loan using the effective interest rate method. At September 30, 2016, $0.2 million of the restructured debt discount remained.  
  Lenders Put Option     Upon a change in control or certain
asset sales, the Term Loan was to be prepaid in an amount equal to the outstanding principal balance plus accrued and unpaid interest, taking into account a prepayment premium that started at 5% of the balance and decreased to 0% over time. The
Company determined that the prepayment feature qualified as an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation from the debt. On May 23, 2014, the derivative was initially valued at $0.6 million and recorded as a long term liability within
 derivative liabilities  in the Company s consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding discount on the Term Loan. Upon default of the Term Loan, the Lenders called for immediate repayment of the Term Loan including a 4% prepayment
penalty. As such, the derivative liability associated with the Term Loan prepayment provision was considered to be extinguished and the prepayment penalty in the amount of $2.4 million was accrued at December 31, 2015. The full prepayment
penalty accrued at December 31, 2015 as well as the additional prepayment fee accrued during 2016 prior to the restructuring was included in the interest and fees that were converted into private company common shares and Series AB preferred
stock upon the restructuring. As such, the full prepayment fee was extinguished on May 3, 2016.    The original issue discount for the prepayment
feature was being amortized over the term of the loan using the effective interest method. The forbearance agreements entered into during 2015 and 2016, triggered a TDR and accelerated the timing of repayment of the Term Loan to January 22,
2016 and the remaining original issue discount was fully amortized in the first quarter of 2016.      Other Note Payable    
 In 2011, the Company issued a $5.0 million senior subordinated note, or the WCAS Note or the Other Note Payable, to WCAS Capital Partners IV, L.P., or WCAS.
Amounts due under the WCAS Note originally bore interest at 10% per annum, payable semi-annually. On May 23, 2013, the WCAS Note was amended such that the note then bore interest at 12% per annum, and all interest accrues as
compounded PIK interest and is added to the aggregate principal amount of the loan semi-annually. The then outstanding principal amount of the note, including accrued PIK interest, is due in full in September 2021. The Company may pay off the WCAS
Note at any time without penalty.

  Concurrently with the closing of the 2016 Merger on May 3, 2016, the Company restructured its WCAS Note.
WCAS converted its outstanding accrued interest and fees of $2.1 million to 1,660,530 shares of private company Series AB preferred stock, which were then converted into 396,201 shares of common stock of the Company upon the merger. At the time of
the debt restructuring, $0.7 million of remaining in debt issuance costs was extinguished and recorded against equity as the lender is also a shareholder of the Company, resulting in a net charge of $1.4 million to equity for the senior subordinated
note (see Senior Secured Debt for additional conversions during 2016).    The principal balance was restated at $5.0 million with 10% per annum payable
entirely as paid-in-kind interest and debt maturity date set at September 8, 2021. No interest payments are required during the term of the loan. The principal balance and any interest accrued during the term of the loan are due on the maturity
date.     9. Derivative Liability      Private Company
Series AB Preferred Stock Warrants     On January 29, 2016, Valeritas, Inc. issued CRG warrants to acquire 16,000,000 Series AB Preferred Stock of
the private company at an exercise price of $1.25 with term of one year from the date of issuance. The warrants were accounted as derivative liability at fair value as the warrant for Series AB embodies a conditional obligation for the Company to
repurchase its shares at a deemed liquidation event.    The fair value of the warrant at the date of issuance is $4.0 million based on the Black-Scholes
option pricing model. Key assumptions used to apply this model upon issuance were as follows:      
   Through April of 2016, CRG exercised warrants to acquire 5,900,000 shares of Series AB Preferred Stock of the private company
(1,407,476 common shares of Valeritas, Holdings, Inc. post recapitalization) for gross proceeds of $7.4 million. The fair value of exercised warrants of $1.6 million was reclassified from derivative liability to additional paid in capital. On
May 3, 2016, the Company cancelled any outstanding warrants to acquire private company Series AB Preferred Stock. The remaining derivative liability balance of $3.0 million was reclassified from derivative liability to additional paid in
capital upon cancellation of the unexercised warrants.    The activities of the private company Series AB warrants are as follows:  
   
    Placement Agent Warrants   
 The Company also issued 83,120 warrants to acquire common stock to the placement agents in the private placement offering that was conducted as part of the
2016 Merger ( PPO ). The warrants are accounted as a derivative liability at fair value as the warrant exercise price is subject to adjustment upon additional issuances of equity securities at a price per share lower than the exercise
price of the warrants.  
      13  

Table of Contents  

  The fair value of the warrant at the date of issuance and at September 30, 2016 was estimated to be $0.3 million,
based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Key assumptions used to apply this model were as follows:      
   The activities of the common stock warrants are as follows:  
   
    10. Offering and acquisition related costs   
 The Company had capitalized deferred offering costs, which primarily consisted of direct incremental legal and accounting fees relating to the Initial Public
Offering (IPO). In 2015, the offering was terminated. The previously capitalized deferred offering costs and additional costs incurred through to the termination of the IPO, aggregated to $4.0 million were expensed in the first quarter of 2015.  
  11. Fair Value Measurements     The Company determines the
fair values of its financial instruments based upon the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Below are the three levels of
inputs that may be used to measure fair value:      

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.    

Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated
by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.        

Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.    
 The Company uses the market approach technique to value its financial instruments and there were no changes in valuation techniques during 2016 or 2015. The
Company s financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, debt instruments and derivative liabilities. For accounts receivable,
accounts payable and accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts of these financial instruments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were considered representative of their fair values due to their short term to maturity. Cash
equivalents are carried at cost which approximates their fair value. The fair value of the Term Loan and WCAS note approximate their carrying value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
      14  

Table of Contents  

  The following tables set forth the Company s financial assets and liabilities that were measured at fair
value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016. No financial assets or liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2015.      
   The Company s derivative liabilities are classified within Level 3 because they are valued with an option pricing model,
where certain inputs to the model are unobservable and reflect the Company s assumptions as to what market participants would use.    The warrants were
valued using the Black Scholes option pricing model (refer to note 9). The life of the warrant is equal to the weighted average remaining contractual life of the warrants. The volatility utilized is based upon the volatilities observed from publicly
traded companies that are comparable to the Company. To date, the Company has not declared or paid dividends to any of its shareholders so the assumed dividend rate is zero. The short term risk-free rate utilized is the yield on US Treasury STRIPS
corresponding to the life of the warrant.    The following table presents the Company s liabilities measured at fair value using significant
unobservable inputs (Level 3), as of September 30, 2016:      
   Concurrent with the closing of the 2016 Merger on May 3, 2016, the Company restructured its Term Loan and WCAS Note that
extended the payment term of respective principal balance of $50 million and $5 million to March 31, 2021 and September 8, 2021. All warrants for private company common stock, Series D and private company Series AB there were outstanding
on May 3, 2016 were cancelled.     12. Commitments and Contingencies   
  Operating Leases     The Company leases buildings in
Shrewsbury, Massachusetts and Bridgewater, New Jersey and equipment under operating lease agreements, expiring through 2017. In addition to rental expense, the Company is obligated to pay costs of insurance, taxes, repairs and maintenance pursuant
to the terms of the leases. The rental payments include the minimum rentals plus common area maintenance charges. Some of the leases include renewal options. Rental expense under operating leases amounted to $0.3 million and $0.4 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Rental expense under operating leases amounted to $1.0 million and $1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
 At September 30, 2016, the Company had the following minimum lease commitments:

   Licensing Agreement   
 Pursuant to a formation agreement, dated as of August 22, 2006 (the Formation Agreement), BioValve and BTI Technologies Inc. (BTI), a wholly owned
subsidiary of BioValve, contributed to Valeritas, LLC all of their right, title and interest in and to all of the assets, properties and rights of BioValve and BTI to the extent related to BioValve s drug delivery/medical device initiative,
consisting of patents and equipment, hereafter referred to as the Device Assets (Device Assets).    On August 22, 2008, the Formation Agreement was
amended and the Company agreed to pay BioValve an amount equal to 9% of any cash upfront license or signing fees and any cash development milestone payments received by the Company in connection with licenses or grants of third party rights to the
use in development or commercialization of the Rapid Infuser Technology. In certain circumstances the Company would owe 10% of such payments received. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, no amounts were owed under this agreement.
Although the Company believes the intellectual property rights around this technology have value, the technology licensed under this agreement is not used in the V-Go or any current products under development.  
  13. Stock-Based Compensation      Stock Options and
Restricted Stock     Total stock-based compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock was $0.9 million and $1.0 million for the
quarter ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Total stock-based compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock was $3.4 million and $4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
 On March 7, 2016, the Company dissolved Valeritas Holdings, LLC. As a result of the dissolution, the 2008 Employee Equity Compensation Plan was
terminated and all options outstanding thereunder were cancelled. On May 3, 2016, the 2014 Employee Equity Compensation Plan (the  2014 Plan ) was terminated and all options outstanding thereunder were cancelled. As a result of
the cancellation of the plans, the Company recognized a one-time expense of $1.6 million during 2016. The 2016 Employee Equity Compensation plan was established concurrently with the 2016 Merger.  
 2016 Employee Equity Compensation Plan Stock option activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was as follows:  
   
   The fair value of the options at the date of issuance was estimated to be $7.1 million, based on the Black-Scholes option
pricing model. Key assumptions used to apply this model upon issuance were as follows:      
 
      16  

Table of Contents  

  During the second and third quarters of 2016, the Company issued restricted stock awards to employees and key
consultants. The grants vest on the first, second and third anniversaries of the original grant date. We recognize compensation expense on all of these awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The fair value of the award is
determined based on the market value of the underlying stock price at the grant date.    The amount of time-based restricted stock compensation recognized
during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from
those estimates. We currently expect, based on historical analysis, an annual forfeiture rate of approximately 22%. This assumption is reviewed periodically and the rate is adjusted as necessary. Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the
vesting period will only be for those awards that vest. Restricted stock award activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is as follows:      
   The fair value of the awards on the date of issuance was estimated to be $2.3 million and $1.3 million remains in unrecognized
compensation related to these awards.     14. Related Party Transactions   
 On September 8, 2011, the Company issued the WCAS Note to WCAS, a private company Series D Preferred shareholder (See discussion of  Other Note
Payable  in note 8). Certain affiliates of WCAS are also common stock shareholders as of September 30, 2016. Upon restructuring of the Company s debt, WCAS converted $2.1 million of outstanding interest into 1,660,530 shares of Series
AB Preferred Stock, which was converted to 396,201 shares of common stock of the Company.    During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, CRG
participated in additional private company Series AB financing as well as exercised its private company Series AB warrants to acquire additional 10,276,030 shares of private company Series AB Preferred Stock (2,518,089 shares of Valeritas Holdings,
Inc. common stock after the 2016 Merger) of the Company for gross amount of $12.8 million. CRG converted its outstanding accrued interest and prepayment premium of approximately $16.5 million into 8,609,824 shares of private company Series AB
preferred stock and 4,649,859 shares of private company common stock. The private company Series AB shares were then converted into 2,053,959 shares of the Company s common stock upon the 2016 Merger and all shares of the private company stock
were canceled upon the 2016 Merger. Upon the closing of the 2016 Merger, the aggregate CRG shares of Series AB Preferred Stock were exchanged for 5,487,766 shares of common stock in Valeritas Holdings, Inc. CRG also took part in the PPO,
contributing additional $20.0 million for 4,000,000 shares common stock of Valeritas Holdings. The aggregate common shares of Valeritas Holdings, Inc. held by CRG upon closing of the 2016 Merger were 9,487,763.  
  15. Stockholders  Deficit     In connection with the
2016 Merger and the retrospective application of the recapitalization of the Company, the par value of each share of common stock of Valeritas Holdings, Inc. of $0.001 and the authorized 300,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of
blank check preferred stock of Valeritas Holdings, Inc. became the capital structure of the Company.    Concurrently with the closing of the 2016 Merger,
and as a condition to the 2016 Merger, the Company closed a private placement offering (the  Private Placement ) of approximately 5 million shares of common stock of Valeritas Holdings at a purchase price of $5.00 per share, for
proceeds of approximately $24.0 million, net of financing costs. Existing investors of the Company invested $20.0 million of the Private Placement. The pre-2016 Merger stockholders of the Company retained an aggregate of 1,000,004 shares of common
stock.

  Prior to the 2016 Merger and recapitalization, Valeritas, Inc. recognized the following preferred stock
transactions in the private company shares:     Series AB Convertible Preferred Stock   
 The Company issued 4,655,430 shares of private company Series AB Preferred Stock (converted into 1,110,613 shares of common stock of Valeritas Holdings, Inc.
as part of the 2016 Merger) on January 29, 2016 for gross proceeds of $5.8 million. During February, March and April of 2016, CRG exercised warrants with respect to 5,900,000 shares of private company Series AB Preferred Stock of Valeritas
(converted into 1,407,476 shares of common stock of Valeritas Holdings, Inc. after the 2016 Merger) for gross proceeds of $7.4 million and $1.6 million of derivative liabilities. As of September 30, 2016, all shares of private company Series AB
Preferred Stock outstanding was converted to common shares of Valeritas Holdings, Inc. All remaining derivative liabilities associated with the Series AB warrants were reclassified to equity upon cancellation.  
 Any amounts funded in connection with the original issuance of the shares of private company common stock, Series D Preferred Stock and Series AA Preferred
Stock have been retrospectively adjusted and accounted for as capital contributions as holders of shares of those classes of Valeritas, Inc. stock did not receive common shares of Valeritas Holdings, Inc. in connection with the 2016 Merger.  
  Debt Conversion     CRG converted its outstanding accrued
interest and prepayment premium of approximately $16.5 million into 8,609,824 shares of private company Series AB preferred stock and 4,649,859 shares of private company common stock. The shares of private company Series AB preferred stock were then
converted into 2,053,959 shares of the Company s common stock upon the 2016 Merger and all shares of the private company common stock were canceled upon the 2016 Merger.  
 Concurrently with the closing of the 2016 Merger on May 3, 2016, the Company restructured the WCAS Note. WCAS converted its outstanding accrued interest
and fees of $2.1 million into 1,660,530 shares of private company Series AB Preferred Stock which were then converted into 396,201 shares of common stock of the Company upon the 2016 Merger. At the time of the debt restructuring, $0.7 million of
remaining in debt issuance costs was extinguished and recorded against equity as the lender is also a stockholder of the Company resulting in a net charge of $1.4 million to equity for the Term Loan.  
  16. Net Loss Per Share     Basic net loss per share excludes
the effect of dilution and is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding less the weighted-average number of shares subject to repurchase during the
period.    Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential shares of common stock, including stock options and warrants to the
extent dilutive. Basic net loss per share was the same as diluted net loss per share for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 as the inclusion of all potential common shares outstanding would have an anti-dilutive effect.
   The following awards were not included in the computation of weighted average common shares for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015:      
   As described in note 1 and Note 15, all outstanding Series AA Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and common stock were
retired and cancelled prior to the 2016 Merger without consideration. They are therefore being excluded in the calculation of the net loss per share calculation included in these financial statements which have been retrospectively adjusted for the
recapitalization of the Company. The weighted average common shares in 2016 and 2015 reflect the outstanding private company Series AB Preferred Stock of the private company as converted at the conversion ratio of 0.23856.

 Valeritas Holdings, Inc. (formerly Cleaner Yoga Mat, Inc.), was incorporated in Florida on May 9, 2014 and was previously engaged in the sale of
sanitizing solutions for Yoga and Pilates studios as well of conventional gyms of all sizes. Valeritas Holdings, Inc. was then reincorporated in Delaware on May 3, 2016 as part of the 2016 Merger (as defined below).  
 On May 3, 2016, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Valeritas Acquisition Corp., a corporation formed in the State of Delaware on May 3, 2016 or the
Acquisition Sub, merged with and into Valeritas, Inc., a corporation incorporated on August 26, 2008 in the state of Delaware or Valeritas or the private company. Pursuant to this transaction or the 2016 Merger in which Valeritas was the
surviving entity and became our wholly-owned subsidiary, we discontinued our pre-2016 Merger business and continued the existing business operations of Valeritas as a publicly-traded company under the name Valeritas Holdings, Inc.  
 In connection with the 2016 Merger and pursuant to a Split-Off Agreement, we transferred our pre-2016 Merger assets and liabilities to our pre-2016 Merger
majority stockholder in exchange for the surrender by her and cancellation of 40,486,000 shares of our common stock. In addition, all of the outstanding stock of Valeritas was converted into shares of our common stock. 
 The 2016 Merger is being accounted for as a  reverse merger,  and Valeritas is deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the reverse merger, because
the shareholders of Valeritas effectively control the combined companies as a result of the 2016 Merger. As such, the historical financial statements of Valeritas Holding, Inc. prior to the 2016 Merger has been replaced with the historical
financial statements of Valeritas.    Amounts for Valeritas historical (pre-merger) common stock, preferred stock, warrants, and stock options including
share and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted using their respective exchange ratio in these financial statements, unless otherwise disclosed. As such, all shares of Valeritas, Inc. common stock, Series D Preferred Stock and Series AA
Preferred Stock have been eliminated in the historical results, beginning with the earliest period presented. Any amounts funded in connection with the original issuance of the common stock, Series D Preferred Stock and Series AA Preferred Stock
have been retrospectively adjusted and accounted for as capital contributions as holders of shares of these classes of Valeritas stock did not receive common shares of Valeritas Holdings, Inc. in connection with the 2016 Merger. All shares of
Valeritas private company Series AB Preferred Stock have been retrospectively adjusted to common stock of Valeritas Holdings, Inc. based upon the exchange ratio noted above.  
 The following discussion highlights Valeritas s results of operations and the principal factors that have affected our financial condition as well as our
liquidity and capital resources for the periods described, and provides information that management believes is relevant for an assessment and understanding of the statements of financial condition and results of operations presented herein. The
following discussion and analysis are based on Valeritas s unaudited financial statements contained in this Report, which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. You should read the
discussion and analysis together with such financial statements and the related notes thereto.     Basis of Presentation   
 The audited financial statements of Valeritas for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 contained in the Form 8-K/A filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission by the Company on May 16, 2016, and the unaudited financial statements of Valeritas for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 contained herein include a summary of our significant
accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the discussion below. In the opinion of management, all material adjustments necessary to present fairly the results of operations for such periods have been included in the unaudited
financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.

   Executive Summary   
  Company Background and Strategy     We are a commercial-stage
medical technology company focused on developing innovative technologies to improve the health and quality of life of people with Type 2 diabetes. We designed our first commercialized product, the V-Go Disposable Insulin Delivery device, or V-Go, to
help patients with Type 2 diabetes who require insulin to achieve and maintain their target blood glucose goals.  V-Go  is a small, discreet and easy-to-use disposable insulin delivery device that a patient
adheres to his or her skin every 24 hours.  V-Go  enables patients to closely mimic the body s normal physiologic pattern of insulin delivery throughout the day and to manage their diabetes with insulin
without the need to plan a daily routine around multiple daily injections.    We currently focus on the treatment of patients with Type 2 diabetes a
pervasive and costly disease that, according to the 2014 National Diabetes Statistics Report released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, currently affects between 90% and 95% of the approximately 22 million U.S.
adults diagnosed with diabetes. The CDC estimates that the combined direct medical and drug costs and indirect lost productivity costs of diabetes in the United States are approximately $245 billion annually. We believe the majority of the
12.8 million U.S. adults treating their Type 2 diabetes with more than one daily oral  anti-diabetic  drug, or OAD, or an injectable diabetes medicine can benefit from V-Go s innovative approach to
Type 2 diabetes management. Our near-term market consists of the approximately 5.8 million of these patients who currently take insulin, which includes 4.6 million patients who have not been able to achieve their target blood glucose goal.
   We commenced commercial sales of V-Go in the United States during 2012. In the second half of 2012, we began hiring sales representatives in selected
U.S. markets. At the end of 2015, our sales team covered 63 territories primarily within the East, South, Midwest and Southwest regions of the United States. Since launching V-Go, the total number of prescriptions for, and the number of patients
using, V-Go have increased each year.     2016 Third Quarter Executive Summary   
 In the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the third quarter of 2015, our revenue increased 2.6% to $4.9 million, gross margin increased from 13.1 % to
35.6%, and our net loss decreased 36.8% to $9.2 million. The following key factors should be considered when reviewing our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity for the periods discussed:  

Our revenue has been impacted by a reduction in our field sales force, which was the result of Company restructuring efforts during February of 2016. In terms of representatives on the ground, we started the third
quarter with 29 filled territories and had an average of 30 filled territories in the quarter (compared to an average of 58 filled territories in the third quarter of 2015. The net growth in revenue was primarily the result of higher average net
pricing in 2016, supported by our executed increase in our gross price charged to distributors.        

We have significantly increased the gross margins for our product by creating manufacturing efficiencies and by implementing cost effective processes in our product development.    
 In obtaining additional financing through our recent offering, we will look to grow our sales force and expand into new markets during 2017, which should
continue the Company s revenue growth.

    Revenue    
 We generate revenue from sales of V-Go to third-party wholesalers and medical supply distributors that take delivery and ownership of  V-Go  and, in turn, sell it to retail pharmacies or directly to patients with Type 2 diabetes. V-Go 30-day packages are sold to wholesalers and distributors at wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) and the Company reports
net revenue after taking into consideration sales deductions as described in the Company s financial statements. Our revenue is generated in the United States, and we view our operations as one operating segment. Financial information is
reviewed on a consolidated basis to allow management to make decisions regarding resource allocations and assess performance.    Revenue increased by 2.6%
to $4.9 million in the third quarter of 2016 from $4.7 million in the third quarter of 2015. In February of 2016, the Company completed a restructuring of the business, one result of which was a significant reduction to the field sales force. In
terms of sales representatives on the ground, we started the quarter with 29 filled territories and had an average of 30 filled territories in the quarter (compared to an average of 58 filled territories in the third quarter of 2015). This reduction
drove a 6.4% drop in the volume of V-Go prescribed to patients in the third quarter of 2016 compared with the same period in 2015. The net revenue increase in 2016 was driven by higher average net prices realized compared with the same comparable
quarterly period in 2015. Although the Company implemented an 8.0% WAC price increase during the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2015, our realized net price increased compared with the same period in 2015 grew by 9.5%. This incremental growth
was driven primarily by a lower mix of patients utilizing our co-pay card program and a corresponding increase through our contracted managed care providers, resulting in a higher average realized net price.  
 On a year to date basis, our revenue increased by 9.3% to $14.8 million in the first nine months of 2016 from $13.5 million in the first nine months of 2015.
In January of 2016, the Company initiated a restructuring of the business, one result of which was a significant reduction to the field sales force post January of 2016. Despite this reduction, the volume of V-Go prescribed and sold to patients
during the first nine months of 2016 remained relatively flat, decreasing by 0.1% compared with the same period in 2015. The net revenue increase in 2016 was driven by higher average net prices realized compared with the same comparable period in
2015. Although the Company implemented an 8.0% WAC price increase during the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2015, our realized net price increased 9.5% compared with the same period in 2015. This incremental growth was driven primarily by a
lower mix of patients utilizing our co-pay card program and a corresponding increase through our contracted managed care providers, resulting in a higher average realized net price.  
   Gross Margin      Cost of goods sold includes raw
materials, labor costs, manufacturing overhead expenses and reserves for anticipated scrap and inventory obsolescence. We currently manufacture V-Go and the EZ Fill accessory in cleanrooms at a contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, in
Southern China. We also have a relationship with a separate CMO that performs our final inspection and packaging functions. Any  single-source  components and suppliers are managed through our global supply
chain operation. We continually work with our manufacturing CMO to refine our manufacturing processes and production lines to improve efficiencies and reduce labor cost. These improvements represent the primary drivers in the current year reduction
in cost of goods sold per unit.    Our gross margin as a percentage of revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was 35.6%, compared to 13.1% during
the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The increase in our gross margin is due to manufacturing efficiencies, implementation of cost effective processes in our product development and the impact of our net price increase.  
 Our gross margin as a percentage of revenues for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was 35.0%, compared to 17.4% during the nine month period
ended September 30, 2015. The increase in our gross margin is due to manufacturing efficiencies, implementation of cost effective processes in our product development and the impact of our net price increase.  
 We expect our overall gross margin, which is calculated as revenue less cost of goods sold for a given period, to fluctuate in future periods as a result of
varying manufacturing output as we strive to reduce near-term inventory levels. In the future, planned changes in and improvements to our manufacturing processes and expenses, as well as increases in production volume up to our current capacity are
expected to further improve our gross margins.      Research and Development    
 Our research and development activities primarily consist of activities associated with our core technologies and processes engineering as well as research
programs associated with products under development. These expenses in 2016 are primarily related to employee compensation, including salary, fringe benefits, share-based compensation and contract employee expenses.  
 Total research and development expenses decreased by 21.8% to $1.2 million in the third quarter of 2016 from $1.5 million in the third quarter of 2015. The
decrease of $0.3 million was primarily comprised of reduced employee-related expenses resulting from our February 2016 restructuring efforts, and to a lesser extent lower external service spending related to our ongoing projects and contract labor
costs.

  Total research and development expenses decreased by 29.3% to $3.6 million in the nine month period ended
September 30, 2016 from $5.1 million in the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. The decrease of $1.5 million was primarily comprised of reduced employee related expenses resulting from our February 2016 restructuring efforts, and to a lesser
extent lower external service spending related to our ongoing projects and contract labor costs.    We expect our research, development and engineering
expenses to increase from current levels as we initiate and advance our development projects, including the prefill V-Go.      Selling, General and
Administrative      Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary, fringe benefits and share-based compensation for our
executive, financial, marketing, sales, business development, regulatory affairs and administrative functions. Other significant expenses include product demonstration samples, trade show expenses, professional fees for our contracted customer
support center, external legal counsel, independent auditors and other consultants, insurance, facilities and information technologies expenses. We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to increase as our business expands.  
 Our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 19.3% in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 to $8.0 million as compared to $9.9 million in the
quarter ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was driven primarily by the impact of our Company restructuring efforts executed in February, 2016 which reduced our field sales force. The remaining savings was realized by lower non-headcount sales
and marketing expenditures. The remaining savings was attributed to our planned reduction in the use of external consulting services used to assist with our marketing initiatives and other professional services.  
 Our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 32.7% in the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 to $24.5 million as compared to $36.5
million in the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was driven primarily by the impact of our Company restructuring efforts executed in February, 2016 which significantly reduced our field sales force. This reduction in employee
related costs was partially offset by a non-cash charge of $1.6 million during 2016 for stock based compensation expenses resulting from the cancellation of the Company s stock option plans. The remaining savings was attributed to our planned
reduction in the use of external consulting services used to assist with our marketing initiatives and other professional services.      Other Income
(Expense), Net      Other income (expense), net primarily consists of interest expense and amortization of debt discount associated with our loan
agreements with Capital Royalty Partners and WCAS Capital Partners IV, L.P. See   Indebtedness  below for more information. Also included are costs related to our financing activities in 2016 and 2015.  
 Interest expense decreased 56.7% during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 to $1.6 million as compared to $3.7 million during the same period in 2015. The
decrease was attributable to a restructuring of the Company Term Loan with CRG and the note payable with WCAS on May 3, 2016. The debt restructuring resulted in a lower restructured principal balance and lower interest rates in the third quarter of
2016 compared with the same period in 2015. The restructured interest rate decreased from 15% per annum in 2015 to 11% in 2016.    Interest expense
decreased 14.4% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to $10.6 million as compared to $12.4 million during the same period in 2015. The decrease was attributable to a restructuring of the Company Term Loan with CRG and the note payable
with WCAS on May 3, 2016. The debt restructuring resulted in a lower restructured principal balance and lower interest rates in the first nine months of 2016 compared with the same period in 2015. The restructured interest rate decreased from
15% per annum in 2015 to 11% on the Senior Secured Debt and 10% on the other note payable in 2016.    During the first nine months of 2015, we expensed
$4.0 million of previously capitalized deferred offering costs incurred from an Initial Public Offering (IPO) effort terminated in March of 2015.    The
decrease in fair value of derivatives of $0.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the increase in fair value of $0.4 million during the same period ended September 30, 2015 is primarily caused by fluctuations in
period end valuations of our derivative liabilities. We held different derivative instruments during each period as well.

   Liquidity and Capital Resources   
 The Company is subject to a number of risks similar to those of early stage commercial companies, including dependence on key individuals, the difficulties
inherent in the development of a commercial market, the potential need to obtain additional capital necessary to fund the development of its products, and competition from larger companies. The Company expects that its sales performance and the
resulting operating income or loss, as well as the status of each of its new product development programs, will significantly impact its cash requirements.  
 The Company has incurred losses each year since inception and has experienced negative cash flows from operations in each year since inception. As of
September 30, 2016, the Company had $15.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and an accumulated deficit of $414.4 million. The Company s restructured Term Loan includes a liquidity covenant whereby the Company must maintain a cash balance
greater than $5.0 million. The Company s cash balance will not be sufficient to satisfy the Company s operations for the next 12 months from September 30, 2016 or maintain its liquidity covenant, which raises substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company estimates that the cash balance will be sufficient to satisfy the Company s operations into mid-first quarter of 2017.  
 The Company expects that its actual sales performance and the resulting operating income or loss, as well as the status of each of its new product development
programs, will significantly impact their cash management. The Company intends to maintain compliance with this liquidity covenant and fund future operations by raising additional capital. There can be no assurances that financing will be available
on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital prior to achieving sustained profitability from operations, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.    The following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  
   
    Operating Activities     The
decrease in net cash used in operating activities for nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily associated with increased product revenue and lower cost of goods sold as a result of
manufacturing efficiencies. In addition, since 2015, operating expense benefited from the Company s restructuring implemented in February, 2016 as well as internal efforts and improvements in managing cash flows.  
  Investing Activities     Net cash used in investing
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was primarily related to purchases of capital equipment for our production lines. The use of cash in both 2016 and 2015 was related to augmenting the already existing production lines
and corresponding capacity with our CMO built during prior years.     Financing Activities   
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was the result of gross proceeds from our common stock financing rounds,
which raised $25.4 million and exercise of Series AB warrants of $7.4 million. Net cash provided by financing activities for the first nine months of 2015 was primarily the result of gross proceeds from the Series D, Series AA and Series AB
Financing of $2.8 million, $15.2 million and $3.0 million respectively. These proceeds were partially offset by issuance costs of $2.6 million in aggregate.

   Indebtedness   
   Senior Secured Debt      On May 23, 2013, the
Company entered into the Term Loan of $50 million with Capital Royalty Group or CRG, structured as a senior secured loan with a six-year term or the Term Loan or the Senior Secured Debt. The Term Loan is secured by substantially all of the
Company s assets, including its material intellectual property. The Term Loan bore interest at 11% per annum and compounded annually. Until the third anniversary of the Term Loan, the Company had the option to pay quarterly interest of
7.5% in cash and 3.5% paid-in-kind, or PIK, interest which is added to the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan on the last day of each quarter. Thereafter, interest on the Term Loan was payable only in cash. The Term Loan contained a minimum
revenue covenant, which was $50.0 million for 2015.    The events of default, described previously, has led the Company to enter into a series of
forbearance agreements with CRG. The initial forbearance agreement was entered into on May 18, 2015 and was subsequently amended five times. The forbearance agreements, as amended in 2015, contained a number of terms and conditions in exchange
for CRG s agreement to forbear. The forbearance agreement imposed an interest rate at the default interest rate of 15% per annum and a prepayment premium of 4% on the aggregate outstanding balance on the date of the repayment. As of
December 31, 2015, the parties deferred the forbearance expiration date again to January 22, 2016. The forbearance agreements entered in 2015 and 2016 were accounted as troubled debt restructuring or TDR. There was no gain associated with
the TDR, however the modified effective interest rate was applied prospectively.    On January 22, 2016, the Company and CRG amended the forbearance
agreement to extend the forbearance period to March 31, 2016. As part of the terms within the forbearance agreement, dated January 29, 2016, the Company issued warrants to CRG exercisable into 16,000,000 shares of private company Series AB
Preferred Stock of the private company at $1.25 per share. The warrant had a term of one year. The warrant fair value at the date of issuance was determined to be $4.0 million, using Black Scholes option pricing model. The warrant was accounted for
as a debt discount and amortized through to May 3, 2016, when the Term Loan was restructured.    On March 25, 2016, the Company and CRG amended
the forbearance agreement to extend the expiration of the forbearance period to April 30, 2016 and included a number of events that could trigger an earlier expiration of the forbearance agreement. This did not result in any restructuring gain
or loss and the modified effective interest rate was applied prospectively.    Concurrently with the closing of the 2016 Merger on May 3, 2016, the
Company restructured its Term Loan. CRG converted its outstanding accrued interest and prepayment premium of $16.5 million into 8,609,824 shares of private company Series AB preferred stock and 4,649,859 shares of private company common stock (see
 Other Note Payable  for additional conversions during 2016). The private company shares of Preferred Stock shares were then converted into 2,053,959 shares of the Company s common stock upon the 2016 Merger and all private company
common shares were canceled upon the 2016 Merger. The principal balance was restated as $50 million with interest rate charged at 11% per annum, which is PIK interest through June 30, 2018 and then both PIK and cash interest thereafter.
The restructured Term Loan agreement requires quarterly interest payments during the term of the loan, which are set to commence on June 30, 2018. The repayment of principal on amounts borrowed under the Senior Secured Debt is scheduled to be
completed on March 31, 2021.    The restructured Senior Secured Debt Agreement contains a financial covenant that requires the Company to maintain a
minimum cash balance of $5.0 million. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with the financial covenant in the restructured Term Loan agreement, as we held cash and cash equivalents of $15.5 million.  
   Other Note Payable      In 2011, the Company issued a
$5.0 million senior subordinated note, or the WCAS Note or the Other Note Payable, to WCAS Capital Partners IV, L.P., or WCAS. Amounts due under the WCAS Note originally bore interest at 10% per annum, payable
 semi-annually.  On May 23, 2013, the WCAS Note was amended such that the note then bore interest at 12% per annum, and all interest accrues as compounded PIK interest and is added to the aggregate
principal amount of the loan semi-annually. The then outstanding principal amount of the note, including accrued PIK interest, is due in full in September 2021. The Company may pay off the WCAS Note at any time without penalty.  
 Concurrently with the closing of the 2016 Merger on May 3, 2016, the Company restructured its WCAS Note. WCAS converted its outstanding accrued interest
and fees of $2.1 million into 1,660,530 shares of private company Series AB Preferred Stock, which were then converted into 396,201 shares of common stock of the Company upon the 2016 Merger. At the time of the debt restructuring, $0.7 million of
remaining in debt issuance costs was extinguished and recorded against equity as the lender is also a stockholder of the Company, resulting in a net charge of $1.4 million to equity for the Term Loan (see  Senior Secured Debt  for
additional conversions during 2016).  
      25  

Table of Contents  

  The principal balance was restated as $5.0 million with 10% per annum payable entirely as paid-in-kind
interest and debt maturity date set at September 8, 2021. No interest payments are required during the term of the loan. The principal balance and any interest accrued during the term of the loan are due on the maturity date.  
   2016 Debt Restructuring      We restructured our
outstanding debt in connection with the 2016 Merger. As part of this restructuring, we renegotiated our Term Loan with CRG, with such amended and restated term loan referred to as the Revised Term Loan, and the WCAS Note, with such amended and
restated note referred to as the Revised WCAS Note. Pursuant to such negotiations, of the total amount of interest, fees, and expenses accrued as of immediately prior to the 2016 Merger equal to $18,650,267, $5,812,324 was converted into shares of
Valeritas s common stock and $12,837,943 was converted into shares of Valeritas s Series AB Preferred Stock, each at a conversion price equal to $1.25 per share. These shares of Series AB Preferred Stock issued to CRG and WCAS as a result
of such conversion were subsequently exchanged for shares of our common stock as part of the 2016 Merger.     Revised Term Loan   
 The material aspects of the Revised Term Loan are as follows:      

The Revised Term Loan will mature and the principal and all accrued paid-in-kind interest will amortize in a single bullet payment, in March, 2021, the twentieth quarterly payment date following the consummation of the
2016 Merger.        

Interest on the Revised Term Loan will accrue at a rate of 11% per annum paid quarterly. Interest is payable, in our discretion, as eight percent cash interest and three percent paid-in-kind interest; provided,
however, that before the eighth quarterly payment date, interest will be payable, in our discretion, in its entirety as paid-in-kind interest. All cash interest will otherwise be paid quarterly. During any period in which an event of default has
occurred and is continuing, the interest rate will increase by four percent, per annum, and payable entirely in cash. Through September 30, 2016 the Company recognized $1.0 million in paid-in-kind interest.    

The Revised Term Loan is secured by a first priority security interest and right of payment in all of our current global assets, accounts and proceeds, or those to be acquired.    

All existing defaults under the Term Loan have been permanently waived.        

We may, in our discretion, repay the Revised Term Loan in whole or in part without any penalty or prepayment fees.        

The Revised Term Loan includes only one financial liquidity operating covenant, which requires that we maintain an end-of-day cash balance greater than $5 million.    
  Revised WCAS Note     The material aspects of the Revised
WCAS Note are as follows:      

The Revised WCAS Note will mature and the principal and all accrued paid-in-kind interest will amortize in a single bullet payment, on September 8, 2021.    

The Revised WCAS Note will accrue interest at a rate of 10% per annum payable entirely as paid-in-kind interest.        

Pursuant to the Subordination Agreement, WCAS s right to payment under the Revised WCAS Note is subject to CRG s payment of the Revised Term Loan.    

All existing defaults under the WCAS Note have been permanently waived.

  Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates     Our
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,
or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in
the future. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions.    While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere
in this filing, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and understanding and evaluating our reported
financial results.     Revenue Recognition     Our revenue
is primarily generated from the sales in the United States of V-Go to third-party wholesalers and medical supply distributors that, in turn, sell it to retail pharmacies or directly to patients.  
 We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title passed, the price is fixed or determinable, and
collectability is reasonably assured. These criteria are applied as follows:      

The evidence of an arrangement generally consists of contractual arrangements with our third-party wholesalers and medical supply distributors.    

Transfer of title and risk and rewards of ownership are passed upon shipment of product to distributors. However, due to uncertainty of customer returns and insufficient historical data that would enable us to estimate
returns, we do not consider this element to have been achieved until the prescription has been dispensed to the patient.    
      27  

Table of Contents  

The selling prices are fixed and agreed upon based on the contracts with wholesalers and medical supply distributors, the customer and contracted insurance payers, if applicable. For sales to customers associated with
insurance providers with whom we do not have a contract, we recognize revenue upon collection of cash at which time the price is determinable. Provisions for discounts and rebates to wholesalers, medical suppliers and payers are established as a
reduction to revenue in the same period the related sales are recorded.        

We consider the overall creditworthiness and payment history of the wholesalers and medical suppliers in concluding whether collectability is reasonably assured.    
 We have entered into agreements with wholesalers, distributors and third-party payers throughout the United States. These agreements may include product
discounts or rebates payable by us to third-party payers upon dispensing V-Go to patients. Additionally, these agreements customarily provide such wholesalers and medical supply distributors with rights to return purchased products within a specific
timeframe, as well as prior to such timeframe if the product is damaged in the normal course of business. Our wholesaler and medical supply distributor customers can generally return purchased product during a period that begins six months prior to
the purchased V-Go s expiration date and ends one year after the expiration date. Each V-Go s expiration date is determined by adding 36 months to the date of manufacture. Returns are no longer honored after delivery to the patient.
Therefore, with respect to each unit of V-Go sold, we record revenue when a patient takes possession of the product.    Revenue from product sales is
recorded net of adjustments for managed care rebates, wholesale distributions fees, cash discounts, and prompt pay discounts, all of which are established at the time of sale. In order to prepare our consolidated financial statements, we are
required to make estimates regarding the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related product sales, including the following:      

managed care rebates, which are based on the estimated end user payer mix and related contractual rebates; and        

distribution fees and prompt pay discounts, which are recorded based on specified payment terms, and which vary by customer.    
 We believe our estimates related to managed care rebates distribution fees and prompt pay discounts do not have a higher degree of estimation complexity or
uncertainty as the related amounts are settled within a relatively short period of time.    We are currently unable to reasonably estimate future returns
due to lack of sufficient historical return data for V-Go. Accordingly, we invoice our customers, record deferred revenue equal to the gross invoice sales price less estimated cash discounts and distribution fees, and record a related deferred cost
of goods sold. We defer recognition of revenue and the related cost of goods sold on shipments of V-Go until a customer s right of return no longer exists, which is once we receive evidence that the product has been distributed to patients
based on our analysis of third-party information. When we believe we have sufficient historical data to develop reasonable estimates of expected returns based upon historical returns, we plan to recognize product sales upon shipment to wholesalers
and medical supply distributors.     Inventories   
 Inventories consists of raw materials, work in process and finished goods, which are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on a first in,
first out, or FIFO, basis and includes material costs, labor and applicable overhead. We perform a review regarding our excess or obsolete inventory and write down any inventory that has no alternative uses to its net realizable value. Economic
conditions, customer demand and changes in purchasing and distribution can affect the carrying value of inventory. As circumstances warrant, we record lower of cost or market inventory adjustments. In some instances, these adjustments can have a
material effect on the financial results of an annual or interim period. In order to determine such adjustments, we evaluate the age, inventory turns and estimated fair value of product inventory by stage of completion and record an adjustment if
estimated market value is below cost.     Impairment of Long-Lived Assets   
 We assess the impairment of long-lived assets, on an ongoing basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. Our impairment review process is based upon an estimate of future undiscounted cash flow. Factors we consider that could trigger an impairment review include the following:  

significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results,        

significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business        

significant negative industry or economic trends        

significant technological changes, which would render equipment and manufacturing processes obsolete    
      28  

Table of Contents  

  Recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying
value to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Future undiscounted cash flows include estimates of future revenues, driven by market growth rates, and estimated future costs. There were no
impairment charges recorded during the nine month periods ended September, 2016 and 2015.     Share-Based Compensation   
 We measure the cost of awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the awards. That cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the entire award.    The fair value of stock options on the date of grant is
calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, based on key assumptions such as the fair value of common stock, expected volatility and expected term. Our estimates of these important assumptions are primarily based on third-party
valuations, historical data, peer company data and our judgment regarding future trends and other factors.

Item 3.  
  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk        Interest Rate Risk   
 We are exposed to financial market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Our cash and cash equivalents include cash in readily available checking and
money market accounts, as well as certificates of deposit. These securities are not dependent on interest rate fluctuations that may cause the principal amount of these assets to fluctuate. Additionally, the interest rate on our outstanding
indebtedness is fixed and is therefore not subject to changes in market interest rates.     Inflation Risk   
 Inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and pricing of contracts. We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our
business, financial condition, or results of operations.     Recently Issued Accounting Standards   
 In April, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying performance obligations and licensing , to
reduce the cost and complexity of applying the guidance on identifying promised goods or services around identifying performance obligations and implementation guidance on determining whether an entity s promise to grant a license provides a
customer with either a right to use the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied at a point in time) or a right to access the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied over time. The Company has not yet selected a
transition method nor have they determined the effect of the standard on our consolidated financial statements.    In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2016-02,  Leases . ASU 2016-2 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual
approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease effectively finances a purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an
effective interest method (finance lease) or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease (operating lease). A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months
regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. ASU 2016-2 supersedes the existing guidance on accounting for leases in  Leases (Topic
840).  The provisions of ASU 2016-2 are effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted and the provisions are to be applied using a
modified retrospective approach. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements.    In March, 2016, the
FASB issued ASU No 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . This ASU contains amendments intended to simplify various aspects of share-based payment accounting and presentation in the financial statements, including
the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, treatment of forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, and classification in the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption of this standard is permitted. The amendments requiring recognition in the income statement of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies
resulting from settlements arising after the date of adoption of the new standard should be applied prospectively. Changes relating to classification of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the statement of cash flows may be applied either
prospectively or retrospectively. All other amendments are to be applied retrospectively. We have not elected early adoption of this standard. We are currently evaluating the impact this new standard will have on our financial statements.  
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements     We did not engage in any
 off-balance sheet arrangements  (as that term is defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K) as of September 30, 2016.

Item 4.  
  Controls and Procedures       We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules
and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ), Chief Financial Officer ( CFO) and our Corporate Controller (our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, respectively) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our CEO, CFO and our Corporate Controller have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016.
However, the Company s management team has initiated certain measures designed to improve the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. These measures, include, but are not limited to, the recruitment and hiring of
a Chief Financial Officer and the hiring and onboarding of an Accounting Manager with experience in annual and quarterly reporting for a public company pursuant to U.S. securities laws, which were both completed during 2016 as well as the
implementation of additional review and approval processes. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable assurances of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in designing and evaluating the controls and procedures. On an on-going basis, we will review and document our disclosure
controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and we may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that our systems evolve with our business.  
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during its most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially
affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. As a result of the consummation of a reverse merger with
Valeritas, Inc. completed on May 3, 2016, Valeritas Holdings, Inc. implemented a new management team. Our new management has not yet conducted a formal evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting.

     Part II   Other Information   

Item 1.  
  Legal Proceedings       There are currently no ongoing litigation matters. Refer to Note 12  
 Commitments and Contingencies,  to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.      

Item 1A.  
  Risk Factors       Although we are not required to include risk factors in our Form 10-Q because we are a
smaller reporting company, we believe the following risk factors are important to highlight in addition to other risk factors as listed in our prior SEC reports.  
  We have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. These
factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.     Since our inception in 2006, we have incurred significant net
losses. Our recurring losses from operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and as a result our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its reports on our
consolidated financial statement for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. Substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern may create negative reactions to the price of the common shares of our stock and we may have a more
difficult time obtaining financing.    As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $15.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and an accumulated deficit of
$414.4 million. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through sales of our preferred stock, debt financings and limited sales of our product. We have devoted substantially all of our resources to the research, development and
engineering of our product, the commercial launch of V-Go, the development of a sales and marketing team and the assembly of a management team to lead our business. The Company estimates that the cash balance will be sufficient to satisfy the
Company s operations into mid-first quarter of 2017.    To implement our business strategy we need to, among other things, increase sales of our
product with our existing sales and marketing infrastructure, fund ongoing research, development and engineering activities, and obtain regulatory clearance in other markets outside the U.S. and European Union or approval to commercialize our
products currently under development. We expect our expenses to increase as we pursue these objectives. The extent of our future operating losses and the timing of profitability are highly uncertain, especially given that we only recently
commercialized V-Go, which makes predicting our sales more difficult. Any additional operating losses will have an adverse effect on our stockholders  equity/(deficit), and we cannot assure you that we will ever be able to achieve or sustain
profitability.     Any failure to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting could materially adversely affect us.   
 Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to include in our annual reports on Form 10-K an assessment by management of the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, at such time, if any, as we are an  accelerated filer  or a  large accelerated filer,  and no longer an  emerging growth company,  our independent
registered public accounting firm will have to attest to and report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of such internal control over financial reporting. As a result of the consummation of the merger with Valeritas, Inc. completed
on May 3, 2016, we have implemented a new management team. Our new management has not yet conducted a formal evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and has not been able to make an assessment on whether the internal
controls over financial reporting are effective. Based upon the last evaluation conducted as of September 30, 2016, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in rules and forms of the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.    While we intend to diligently and thoroughly document, review, test and improve our internal control over financial reporting in
order to ensure compliance with Section 404, management may not be able to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Furthermore, even if management were to reach such a conclusion, if at that time an attestation
report of our independent registered public accounting firm is required and such firm is not satisfied with the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, or if the independent auditors interpret the requirements, rules or
regulations differently than we do, then they may decline to attest to management s assessment or may issue a report that is qualified. Any of these events could result in a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial
statements, which in turn could negatively affect the price of our common stock.

  In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial
reporting to allow management and (if required in the future) our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404. Our compliance with
Section 404 may require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We currently do not have an internal audit group, and we will need to retain the services of additional accounting and financial
staff or consultants with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge to satisfy the ongoing requirements of Section 404. We intend to review the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and make any
changes management determines appropriate, including to achieve compliance with Section 404 by the date on which we are required to so comply.
