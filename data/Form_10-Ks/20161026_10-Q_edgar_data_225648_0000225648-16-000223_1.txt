COVANTA HOLDING CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
  The terms  we,   our,   ours,   us  and  Company  refer to Covanta Holding Corporation and its subsidiaries; the term  Covanta Energy  refers to our subsidiary Covanta Energy, LLC and its subsidiaries. 
  Organization 
  Covanta is one of the world s largest owners and operators of infrastructure for the conversion of waste to energy (known as  energy-from-waste  or  EfW ), and also owns and operates related waste transport and disposal and other renewable energy production businesses. EfW serves two key markets as both a sustainable waste management solution that is environmentally superior to landfilling and as a source of clean energy that reduces overall greenhouse gas emissions and is considered renewable under the laws of many states and under federal law. Our facilities are critical infrastructure assets that allow our customers, which are principally municipal entities, to provide an essential public service. 
  Our EfW facilities earn revenue from both the disposal of waste and the generation of electricity and/or steam, generally under contracts, as well as from the sale of metal recovered during the EfW process. We process approximately   20 million   tons of solid waste annually. We operate and/or have ownership positions in   42   energy-from-waste facilities, which are primarily located in North America.  In total, these assets produce approximately   10 million   megawatt hours ( MWh ) of baseload electricity annually. We also operate a waste management infrastructure that is complementary to our core EfW business. 
  We have   one   reportable segment,   North America, which is comprised of waste and energy services operations located primarily in the United States and Canada.   We are currently constructing an energy-from-waste facility in Dublin, Ireland, which we own and will operate upon completion.  We hold equity interests in China and Italy.  
  Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all information and notes thereto required by GAAP for complete consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for fair presentation have been included in our condensed consolidated financial statements. All intra-entity accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Operating results for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending   December 31, 2016  .  This Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   ( Form 10-K ). 
  Reclassification 
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , certain amounts have been reclassified in our prior period balance sheet and cash flows to conform to current year presentation and such amounts were not material to current and prior periods. We concluded that it was appropriate to include Net interest expense on project debt within Interest expense, net on our consolidated statement of operations.  Previously, Net interest expense on project debt was reported separately, as a component of Operating expense. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, Net interest expense on project debt of   $3 million   and   $10 million  , respectively, was included in Interest expense, net on our condensed consolidated statement of operations and as a result, Operating income increased accordingly for those periods. 
  Change in Accounting Principle 
  Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted guidance concerning the presentation of debt issuance costs, which are required to be presented as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability.  We adopted this guidance retrospectively, which resulted in a reduction in our December 31, 2015 current and non-current asset balances of   $8 million   and   $40 million  , respectively, along with a corresponding reduction in current and long-term debt balances. For additional information, see   Note 6. Consolidated Debt  .  
   
  NOTE 2. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued updated guidance on eight specific cash flow issues with regard to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows in order to clarify existing guidance and reduce diversity in practice.  The guidance is required to be adopted in the first quarter of 2018 on a retrospective basis, unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case it should be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated statement of cash flows.

  COVANTA HOLDING CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - (Continued) 

In March 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance for employee share-based compensation.  The updated guidance changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The guidance, which is required to be adopted in the first quarter of 2017, may be early adopted. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance for lease arrangements in order to increase transparency and comparability by providing additional information to users of financial statements regarding an entity's leasing activities. The revised guidance seeks to achieve this objective by requiring reporting entities to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for substantially all lease arrangements. The guidance, which is required to be adopted in the first quarter of 2019, will be applied on a modified retrospective basis beginning with the earliest period presented. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance that would require equity investments not accounted for as an equity method investment or that result in consolidation to be recorded at their fair value with changes in fair value recognized in our consolidated statements of operations. Those equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value may be measured at cost less impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes. This standard is required to be adopted in the first quarter of 2018, with early adoption prohibited. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance based on the principle that revenue is recognized in an amount expected to be collected and to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for the transfer of goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date by one year to January 1, 2018, while providing the option to early adopt the standard on the original effective date of January 1, 2017. We do not intend to early adopt. We will first adopt the guidance of ASC606 in the first quarter of 2018, as required.  The guidance can be adopted either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We are currently evaluating the adoption alternatives, which include utilizing a bottom-up approach to analyze the standard s impact on our contract portfolio, comparing historical accounting policies and practices to the new standard to identify potential differences from applying the requirements of the new standard to our contracts. We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we yet determined the effect of the standard on our consolidated financial statements.  We expect this determination will near completion in late 2016 or early 2017.  Because the new standard will impact our business processes, systems and controls, we are in the process of developing a comprehensive change management project plan to guide the implementation.  
   
  NOTE 3. DISPOSITIONS AND OTHER 
  China Investments 
   Our interests in China included an   85%   ownership of an EfW facility located in Jiangsu Province ("Taixing"), a   49%   equity interest in an EfW facility located in Sichuan Province and a   40%   equity interest in Chongqing Sanfeng Covanta Environmental Industry Co., a company located in the Chongqing Municipality that is engaged in the business of providing design and engineering, procurement, construction services and equipment sales for EfW facilities in China, as well as operating services for EfW facilities.  
  During March 2016, we completed the exchange of our ownership interests in China for a   15%   ownership interest in Chongqing Sanfeng Covanta Environmental Industrial Group, Co., Ltd ("Sanfeng Environment") pursuant to agreements entered into in July 2015.  During September 2016, we completed the sale of approximately   90%   of the aforementioned ownership interest in Sanfeng Environment to a third-party, a subsidiary of CITIC Limited ("CITIC"), a leading Chinese industrial conglomerate and investment company, pursuant to the July 2015 agreements. As a result, during the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a pre-tax gain of   $41 million  .  We received pre-tax proceeds of   $105 million  .  The gain resulted from the excess of pre-tax proceeds over the cost-method book value of   $70 million  , plus   $5 million   of realized gains on the related cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment, that were reclassified out of other comprehensive income.    
  In connection with these transactions, we entered into foreign currency exchange collars and forwards to hedge against rate fluctuations that impacted the cash proceeds in U.S. dollar terms. For more information, see   Note 11. Derivative Instruments  .  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our remaining cost-method investment in Sanfeng Environment totaled   $7 million   and was included in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as a component of "Other assets".  Cost-method investments are carried at historical cost unless indicators of impairment are identified. There were no impairment indicators related to our cost-method investment during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  As of December 31, 2015, the assets and liabilities associated with our China investments were presented in our condensed consolidated balance sheets as Current "Assets held for sale  and Current "Liabilities held for sale.

Pittsfield EfW Facility 
  In March 2016, we exercised an early termination option available under the steam sale agreement at our Pittsfield EfW facility that would have been effective in March 2017.  Upon termination of the steam agreement, we intended to cease operations at the Pittsfield facility. As a result, during the first quarter of 2016, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of   $13 million  , pre-tax, which was calculated based on the estimated cash flows for this facility during its remaining operations utilizing Level 3 inputs. For more information regarding fair value measurements, see   Note 10. Financial Instruments  .  
  In October 2016, we withdrew our termination notice.  The City of Pittsfield has agreed to fund upgrades to the facility and the State of Massachusetts will provide energy tax credits, both of which will serve to improve the economics of the facility.  In addition, we will continue to sell steam generated by the facility under an amended agreement. 
  Tartech Investment 
   We are party to a joint venture that was formed to recover and recycle metals from EfW ash monofills in North America.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , due to operational difficulties and the decline in the scrap metal market, a valuation of the entity was conducted.  As a result, we recorded a net impairment of our investment in this joint venture of   $3 million  , pre-tax, which represents our portion of the carrying value of the entity in excess of the fair value.  Such amount was calculated based on the estimated liquidation value of the tangible equipment utilizing Level 3 inputs. For more information regarding fair value measurements, see   Note 10. Financial Instruments  .  
   
  NOTE 4.  EARNINGS PER SHARE ( EPS ) AND EQUITY 
  Earnings Per Share 
  We calculate basic earnings per share ("EPS") using net earnings for the period and the weighted average number of outstanding shares of our common stock, par value   $0.10   per share, during the period. Basic weighted average shares outstanding have decreased due to share repurchases.  Diluted earnings per share computations, as calculated under the treasury stock method, include the weighted average number of shares of additional outstanding common stock issuable for stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units whether or not currently exercisable. Diluted earnings per share does not include securities if their effect was anti-dilutive.  Basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding were as follows (in millions): 

(1) Excludes the following securities because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive: 

Equity 
  Share Repurchases 
  In January 2016, we repurchased approximately   1.2 million   shares of our common stock at a weighted average cost of   $15.29   per share for an aggregate amount of   $18 million  . 
    
  Dividends per Share 
  Dividends declared per share were   $0.25   for each of the three-month periods ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015   and   $0.75   for each of the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  . Cash dividends declared were   $33 million   and   $34 million   for the three month periods ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively and   $99 million   and   $101 million   for the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively.

Credit Facilities 
  Our subsidiary, Covanta Energy, has   $1.2 billion   in senior secured credit facilities consisting of a   $1.0 billion   revolving credit facility, expiring 2019 through 2020, (the  Revolving Credit Facility ) and a   $200 million   term loan due 2020 (the  Term Loan ) (collectively referred to as the "Credit Facilities").   
  Availability under Revolving Credit Facility 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had availability under the Revolving Credit Facility as follows (in millions): 

(1) The Revolving Credit Facility consists of two tranches; Tranche A (  $950 million  ), which expires in 2020, and Tranche B (  $50 million  ), which expires in March 2019. 
  Repayment Terms 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Term Loan has mandatory remaining amortization payments of   $1 million   in 2016,   $5 million   in each of the years 2017 through 2019 and   $182 million   in 2020. The Credit Facilities are pre-payable at par at our option at any time.  
  Guarantees and Security 
  The Credit Facilities are guaranteed by us and by certain of our subsidiaries. The subsidiaries that are party to the Credit Facilities agreed to secure all of the obligations under the Credit Facilities by granting, for the benefit of secured parties, a first priority lien on substantially all of their assets, to the extent permitted by existing contractual obligations; a pledge of substantially all of the capital stock of each of our domestic subsidiaries and   65%   of substantially all the capital stock of each of our foreign subsidiaries which are directly owned, in each case to the extent not otherwise pledged.  
  Credit Agreement Covenants 
  The loan documentation governing the Credit Facilities contains various affirmative and negative covenants, as well as financial maintenance covenants (financial ratios), that limit our ability to engage in certain types of transactions. We were in compliance with all of the affirmative and negative covenants under the Credit Facilities as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Union County EfW Capital Lease Arrangement 
  In June 2016, we extended the lease term related to the Union County EfW facility through 2053, which resulted in capital lease treatment for the revised lease. We recorded lease liability of   $104 million  , calculated utilizing an incremental borrowing rate of   5.0%  .  The lease includes certain periods of contingent rentals based upon plant performance as either a share of revenue or a share of plant profits.  These contingent payments have been excluded from the calculation of the lease liability and instead will be treated as a period expense when incurred.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the outstanding borrowings under the capital lease have mandatory amortization payments remaining as follows (in millions): 

Other Non-current Liabilities 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Dublin convertible preferred instrument of   $91 million   was included in other noncurrent liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
    
  Capitalized Interest 
  Interest expense paid and costs amortized to interest expense related to project financing are capitalized during the construction and start-up phase of the project.  Total interest expense capitalized was   $7 million   and   $2 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $20 million   and   $4 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

NOTE 7. INCOME TAXES 
  We record our interim tax provision based upon our estimated annual effective tax rate ("ETR") and account for tax effects of discrete events in the period in which they occur. We review the ETR on a quarterly basis as projections are revised and laws are enacted. The ETRs were   (50)%   and   48%     for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015  , respectively.  The decrease in the ETR was primarily attributable to the gain from the sale of ownership interests in China, which was tax effected discretely as it was deemed unusual and infrequent.  In addition, the changes in the mix of earnings and the change from forecasted pre-tax income in 2015 to forecasted pre-tax loss in 2016 also contributed to the ETR change.  

NOTE 8. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 
  Pass through costs 
  Pass through costs are costs for which we receive a direct contractually committed reimbursement from the municipal client which sponsors an energy-from-waste project. These costs generally include utility charges, insurance premiums, ash residue transportation and disposal, and certain chemical costs. These costs are recorded net of municipal client reimbursements in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Total pass through costs were   $9 million   and   $13 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively, and   $28 million   and   $34 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. 
  Impairment charges 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded non-cash impairment charges of   $19 million  , pre-tax, of which   $13 million  , related to the previously planned closure of our Pittsfield EfW facility and   $3 million  , pre-tax, related to our Tartech investment. See   Note 3. Dispositions and Other   for additional information. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we identified indicators of impairment associated with our biomass facilities, primarily due to a decline in energy market pricing. As a result of these developments, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of   $24 million  , pre-tax, which was calculated based on a range of potential outcomes utilizing various estimated cash flows for these facilities utilizing Level 3 inputs.  
   
  NOTE 9. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we awarded certain employees grants of   748,569   shares of restricted stock and   437,275   restricted stock units ("RSUs"). The restricted stock awards will be expensed over the requisite service period, subject to an assumed   12%   average forfeiture rate.  The terms of the restricted stock awards include vesting provisions based solely on continued service. If the service criteria are satisfied, the restricted stock awards generally vest during March of 2017, 2018, and 2019.    
  Additionally, during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we awarded certain employees grants of   390,728   RSUs that will vest based upon the Company s cumulative Free Cash Flow per share over a three year performance period.  
   During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we withheld   210,169   shares of our common stock in connection with tax withholdings for vested stock awards. 
  On May 5, 2016, we awarded   9,000   shares of restricted stock and   54,591   restricted stock units for annual director compensation.  We determined the service vesting condition of these restricted stock awards and restricted stock units to be non-substantive and, in accordance with accounting principles for stock compensation, recorded the entire fair value of the awards as compensation expense on the grant date. 
  On September 22, 2016, the Board of Directors appointed two new board members.  We awarded   5,550   restricted stock units for the prorated portion of their annual director compensation.  We determined the service vesting condition of these restricted stock awards and restricted stock units to be non-substantive and, in accordance with accounting principles for stock compensation, recorded the entire fair value of the awards as compensation expense on the grant date. 
  Compensation expense related to our stock-based awards totaled   $4 million   and   $4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively and   $13 million   and   $15 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The stock-based award compensation for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   included expense recognized for stock awards and accelerated vesting of stock awards pursuant to separation agreements in connection with the departure of two executive offers during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .

NOTE 10. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
  Fair Value Measurements 
  Authoritative guidance associated with fair value measurements provides a framework for measuring fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value, giving the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs), then significant other observable inputs (Level 2 inputs) and the lowest priority to significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs).The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments: 
             
    For cash and cash equivalents, restricted funds, and marketable securities, the carrying value of these amounts is a reasonable estimate of their fair value. The fair value of restricted funds held in trust is based on quoted market prices of the investments held by the trustee. 
                
    Fair values for long-term debt and project debt are determined using quoted market prices. 
                
    The fair value for interest rate swaps were determined by obtaining quotes from two counterparties (one is a holder of the long position and the other is in the short) and extrapolating those across the long and short notional amounts.  The fair value of the interest rate swaps was adjusted to reflect counterparty risk of non-performance, and was based on the counterparty s credit spread in the credit derivatives market. 
                
    The fair values of our energy hedges were determined using the spread between our fixed price and the forward curve information available within the market. 
                
    The fair value of our foreign currency hedge was determined by obtaining quotes from two counterparties and is based on market accepted option pricing methodology which utilizes inputs such as the currency spot rate as of the balance sheet date, the strike price of the options and volatility. 
     The estimated fair value amounts have been determined using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment is necessarily required in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we would realize in a current market exchange. The fair-value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent information available to us as of   September 30, 2016  . Such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since   September 30, 2016  , and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein.

Foreign Exchange Risk 
  In order to hedge the risk of adverse foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impacting the expected sale proceeds from our equity transfer agreement in China (See   Note 3. Dispositions and Other  ), we entered into foreign currency exchange forwards with two financial institutions, covering approximately   $100 million   of notional, to protect against further rate fluctuations pending the expected close of the sale of our ownership interest to CITIC.  The foreign currency forwards were accounted for as derivative instruments and, accordingly, were recorded at fair value quarterly with any change in fair value recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of operations as "Other expense, net."  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , cash provided by foreign currency exchange settlements totaled   $5 million   and was included in net cash used in investing activities on our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.   
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we received   $105 million   of gross sale proceeds relating to the aforementioned sale of our ownership interests to CITIC and therefore, settled or canceled remaining foreign currency exchange derivatives related to this hedged transaction, resulting in a current asset balance of   zero  .  The table below summarizes foreign currency derivatives that have settled or canceled to date (in millions): 

We have also entered into foreign currency forwards to manage foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations associated with a series of fixed payments to be made by an international subsidiary through the end of 2017.  This foreign currency forward is accounted for as a derivative instrument at fair value in our quarterly condensed consolidated balance sheet with any changes in fair value recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of operations as "Other expense, net."  This derivative instrument was not material to our condensed consolidated statement of operations nor was it material to our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016  .

Energy Price Risk 
  Following the expiration of certain long-term energy sales contracts, we may have exposure to market risk, and therefore revenue fluctuations, in energy markets. We have entered into contractual arrangements that will mitigate our exposure to short-term volatility through a variety of hedging techniques, and will continue to do so in the future. Our efforts in this regard will involve only mitigation of price volatility for the energy we produce, and will not involve taking positions (either long or short) on energy prices in excess of our physical generation. The amount of energy generation for which we have hedged under agreements with various financial institutions is indicated in the following table (in millions): 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of the energy derivatives of   $11 million  , pre-tax, was recorded as a   $9 million   current asset and a   $2 million   noncurrent asset. The change in fair value was recorded as a component of AOCI. As of   September 30, 2016  , the amount of hedge ineffectiveness was not material. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , cash provided by and used in energy derivative settlements of   $26 million   and   zero  , respectively, was included in net cash provided by operating activities on our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , cash provided by and used in energy derivative settlements of   $11 million   and   $7 million  , respectively, was included in the change in net cash provided by operating activities on our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. 
  Interest Rate Swaps 
  In order to hedge the risk of adverse variable interest rate fluctuations associated with the Dublin senior term loan, we have entered into floating to fixed rate swap agreements with various financial institutions terminating between 2016 and 2021, denominated in Euros, for the full    250 million   loan amount. This interest rate swap is designated as a cash flow hedge which is recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of AOCI. As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of the interest rate swap derivative of   $27 million  , pre-tax, was recorded as a   $2 million   and   $25 million   current and noncurrent liability, respectively.  There was an immaterial amount of ineffectiveness recorded during the quarter recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of operations as interest expense. 
   
  NOTE 12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  We and/or our subsidiaries are party to a number of claims, lawsuits and pending actions, most of which are routine and all of which are incidental to our business. We assess the likelihood of potential losses on an ongoing basis and when losses are considered probable and reasonably estimable, record as a loss an estimate of the outcome. If we can only estimate the range of a possible loss, an amount representing the low end of the range of possible outcomes is recorded. The final consequences of these proceedings are not presently determinable with certainty. 
  Environmental Matters  
  Our operations are subject to environmental regulatory laws and environmental remediation laws. Although our operations are occasionally subject to proceedings and orders pertaining to emissions into the environment and other environmental violations, which may result in fines, penalties, damages or other sanctions, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations. 
  We may be identified, along with other entities, as being among parties potentially responsible for contribution to costs associated with the correction and remediation of environmental conditions at disposal sites subject to federal and/or analogous state laws. In certain instances, we may be exposed to joint and several liabilities for remedial action or damages. Our liability in connection with such environmental claims will depend on many factors, including our volumetric share of waste, the total cost of remediation, and the financial viability of other companies that also sent waste to a given site and, in the case of divested operations, the contractual arrangement with the purchaser of such operations. 
  The potential costs related to the matters described below and the possible impact on future operations are uncertain due in part to the complexity of governmental laws and regulations and their interpretations, the varying costs and effectiveness of cleanup technologies, the uncertain level of insurance or other types of recovery and the questionable level of our responsibility. Although the ultimate outcome and expense of any litigation, including environmental remediation, is uncertain, we believe that the following proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated financial position or results of operations.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - (Continued) 

Lower Passaic River Matter.   In August 2004, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the  EPA ) notified Covanta Essex Company ( Essex ) that it was a potentially responsible party ( PRP ) for Superfund response actions in the Lower Passaic River Study Area, referred to as  LPRSA,  a 17 mile stretch of river in northern New Jersey. Essex s LPRSA costs to date are not material to its financial position and results of operations; however, to date the EPA has not sought any LPRSA remedial costs or natural resource damages against PRPs. On March 3, 2016, the EPA released the Record of Decision ( ROD ) for its Focused Feasibility Study of the lower 8 miles of the LPRSA; the EPA s selected remedy includes capping/dredging of sediment, institutional controls and long-term monitoring. The Essex facility started operating in 1990 and Essex does not believe there have been any releases to the LPRSA, but in any event believes any releases would have been de minimis considering the history of the LPRSA; however, it is not possible at this time to predict that outcome or to estimate the range of possible loss relating to Essex s liability in the matter, including for LPRSA remedial costs and/or natural resource damages. 
  North Carolina Transformer Site Matter.   In December 2012, our subsidiary, Covanta Dade Power Corp. ( Dade ) received a letter from the EPA indicating Dade was named as a PRP, along with numerous other unidentified PRPs, relating to the cleanup of the Ward Transformer Superfund Site in Raleigh, North Carolina ( Ward Site ). Dade's alleged liability as a PRP stems from the 1994 servicing at the Ward Site of a transformer alleged to have contained PCB-contaminated oil. The EPA is seeking reimbursement from PRPs for its oversight costs in connection with ongoing cleanup activities at the Ward Site. While our investigation in this matter is continuing, based on information obtained to date, we believe Dade's responsibility, if any, in connection with this matter to be de minimis; and subject to indemnity by Veolia Environmental Services North America, LLC, from which we acquired Dade in 2010; however, it is not possible at this time to estimate the range of possible loss relating to Dade's ultimate liability, if any, in this matter. 
  Tulsa Matter.   In January 2016, we were informed by the office of the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Oklahoma ( U.S. Attorney ) that our subsidiary, Covanta Tulsa Renewable Energy LLC, is the target of a criminal investigation being conducted by the EPA. We understand that the EPA plans to allege improprieties in the recording and reporting of emissions data during an October 2013 incident involving one of the three municipal waste combustion units at our Tulsa, Oklahoma facility.  We believe that our operations in Tulsa were and are in compliance with existing laws and regulations in all material respects.  While we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of this matter, we do not believe that the investigation or any issues arising therefrom will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. 
  Other Matters 
  Durham-York Contractor Arbitration 
  We are seeking to resolve outstanding disputes with our primary contractor for the Durham-York construction project regarding (i) claims by the contractor for change orders and other expense reimbursement and (ii) claims by us for charges and liquidated damages for project completion delays.  Our contract with this contractor contemplates binding arbitration to resolve these disputes, which we expect may conclude in 2017. While we do not expect resolution of these disputes to have a material adverse impact on our financial position, it could be material to our results of operations and or cash flows in any given accounting period. 
  Other Commitments 
  Other commitments as of   September 30, 2016   were as follows (in millions): 

The letters of credit were issued to secure our performance under various contractual undertakings related to our domestic and international projects or to secure obligations under our insurance program. Each letter of credit relating to a project is required to be maintained in effect for the period specified in related project contracts, and generally may be drawn if it is not renewed prior to expiration of that period. 
  We believe that we will be able to fully perform under our contracts to which these existing letters of credit relate, and that it is unlikely that letters of credit would be drawn because of a default of our performance obligations. If any of these letters of credit were to be drawn by the beneficiary, the amount drawn would be immediately repayable by us to the issuing bank. If we do not immediately repay such amounts drawn under letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility, unreimbursed amounts would be treated under the Credit Facilities as either additional term loans or as revolving loans.

  COVANTA HOLDING CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - (Continued) 

The surety bonds listed in the table above relate primarily to construction and performance obligations and support for other obligations, including closure requirements of various energy projects when such projects cease operating. Were these bonds to be drawn upon, we would have a contractual obligation to indemnify the surety company.   
  We have certain contingent obligations related to the 7.25% Notes, 6.375% Notes, 5.875% Notes, and Tax-Exempt Bonds. Holders may require us to repurchase their 7.25% Notes, 6.375% Notes, 5.875% Notes and Tax-Exempt Bonds if a fundamental change occurs. For specific criteria related to the redemption features of the 5.875% Notes, 7.25% Notes or 6.375% Notes, see   Item 8. Financial Statements And Supplementary Data   Note 11. Consolidated Debt   of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  We have issued or are party to guarantees and related contractual support obligations undertaken pursuant to agreements to construct and operate waste and energy facilities. For some projects, such performance guarantees include obligations to repay certain financial obligations if the project revenue is insufficient to do so, or to obtain or guarantee financing for a project. With respect to our businesses, we have issued guarantees to municipal clients and other parties that our subsidiaries will perform in accordance with contractual terms, including, where required, the payment of damages or other obligations. Additionally, damages payable under such guarantees for our energy-from-waste facilities could expose us to recourse liability on project debt. If we must perform under one or more of such guarantees, our liability for damages upon contract termination would be reduced by funds held in trust and proceeds from sales of the facilities securing the project debt and is presently not estimable. Depending upon the circumstances giving rise to such damages, the contractual terms of the applicable contracts, and the contract counterparty s choice of remedy at the time a claim against a guarantee is made, the amounts owed pursuant to one or more of such guarantees could be greater than our then-available sources of funds. To date, we have not incurred material liabilities under such guarantees. 
  Benefit Obligations - Defined Contribution Plans 
  Substantially all of our employees in the United States are eligible to participate in defined contribution plans we sponsor. Our costs related to defined contribution plans were   $5 million   and   $4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $13 million   and   $12 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
  Dublin EfW Facility 
  In connection with the financing of the Dublin EfW facility, Covanta Energy has made commitments for contingent support as follows: (1) lending commitments up to    25 million   to fund working capital shortfalls in the project company under certain circumstances during operations; and (2) up to    75 million   commitment in the aggregate to provide support payments to the project company, under certain circumstances, in the event waste revenue falls below minimum levels (set far below anticipated levels). 
  Essex County EfW Facility 
  We are implementing significant operational improvements at our Essex County EfW facility at a total estimated cost of approximately   $90 million  . Construction commenced in 2014 and is expected to be substantially completed in 2016.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have approximately   $18 million   of capital expenditures remaining to be incurred related to these improvements.  
  New York City Waste Transport and Disposal Contract 
  In 2013, New York City awarded us a contract to handle waste transport and disposal from two marine transfer stations located in Queens and Manhattan. Service for the Manhattan marine transfer station is expected pending approval from New York City.   As of   September 30, 2016  , we expect to incur approximately   $32 million   of additional capital expenditures, primarily for transportation equipment.

Item 2.     MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  The following MD A is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Covanta Holding Corporation and its subsidiaries; ("Covanta" or the "Company") for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The term "Covanta Energy" refers to our subsidiary Covanta Energy, LLC and its subsidiaries.  The financial information as of   September 30, 2016   should be read in conjunction with the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 contained in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  Factors Affecting Business Conditions and Financial Results 
  The following are various published pricing indices relating to the U.S. economic drivers that are relevant to those aspects of our business where we have market exposure; however, there is not an exact correlation between our results and changes in these metrics. 

(1) 
    Represents the year-over-year percent change in the Headline CPI number. The Consumer Price Index (CPI-U) data is provided by the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
                (4) 
    Average price per MMBtu for Q3 2016 and Q3 2015. The Henry Hub Pricing data is provided by the Natural Gas Weekly Update, Energy Information Administration, Washington, DC. Nebraska Energy Office, Lincoln, NE. 
              (5) 
    Average price per gross ton for Q3 2016 and Q3 2015. The #1 Heavy Melt Steel ("HMS") composite index ($/gross ton) price is published by American Metal Market. 
              (6)  
    Average price per pound for Q3 2016 and Q3 2015.  Calculated using the high and low prices for Old Sheet   Old Cast Scrap Metals ($/lb.) published by American Metal Market. 
     Seasonal -   Our quarterly operating income (loss) within the same fiscal year typically differs substantially due to seasonal factors, primarily as a result of the timing of scheduled plant maintenance. We conduct scheduled maintenance periodically each year, which requires that individual boiler and/or turbine units temporarily cease operations. During these scheduled maintenance periods, we incur material repair and maintenance expense and receive less revenue until the boiler and/or turbine units resume operations. This scheduled maintenance usually occurs during periods of off-peak electric demand and/or lower waste volumes, which are our first, second and fourth fiscal quarters. The scheduled maintenance period in the first half of the year (primarily first quarter and early second quarter) is typically the most extensive, while the third quarter scheduled maintenance period is the least extensive. Given these factors, we normally experience our lowest operating income from our projects during the first half of each year. 
  Our operating income may also be affected by seasonal weather extremes during summers and winters.  Increased demand for electricity and natural gas during unusually hot or cold periods may affect certain operating expenses and may trigger material price increases for a portion of the electricity and steam we sell.  
  Quarter Updates  
  China Investments 
  During March 2016, we completed the exchange of our ownership interests in China for a   15%   ownership interest in Chongqing Sanfeng Covanta Environmental Industrial Group, Co., Ltd ("Sanfeng Environment") pursuant to agreements entered into in July 2015.  During September 2016, we sold approximately   90%   of the aforementioned ownership interest in Sanfeng Environment to a subsidiary of CITIC Limited ("CITIC"), a leading Chinese industrial conglomerate and investment company, pursuant to the July 2015 agreements.  As a result, during the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded pre-tax gain of   $41 million  .  The gain results from pre-tax proceeds of   $105 million   in excess of the cost-method book value of   $70 million  , plus   $5 million   of realized gains on the related cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment.

Pittsfield EfW Facility 
  In March, we exercised an early termination option available under our steam sale agreement for our Pittsfield EfW facility that would have been effective in March 2017.  Upon termination of the steam agreement, we intended to cease operations at the Pittsfield facility. As a result, during the first quarter of 2016 we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of   $13 million  , pre-tax, which was calculated based on the estimated cash flows for this facility during its remaining operations utilizing Level 3 inputs. Assumptions used in determining future operating results and cash flows include current and expected market conditions and future operations forecasts. It is possible that these assumptions and estimates may change resulting in the need to adjust our determination of fair value. For more information regarding fair value measurements, see   Note 10. Financial Instruments  .  
  In October 2016, we withdrew our termination notice.  The city agreed to fund upgrades to the facility and the state will provide energy tax credits, both of which will serve to improve the economics of the facility.  In addition, we will continue to sell steam generated by the facility under an amended agreement. 
  Tartech Investment 
   We are party to a joint venture that was formed to recover and recycle metals from EfW ash monofills in North America. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , due to operational difficulties and the decline in the scrap metals market, a valuation of the entity was conducted.  As a result, we recorded a net impairment of our investment in this joint venture of   $3 million  , pre-tax, which represents our portion of the fair value of entity in excess of the carrying value.  
  Contract Extensions 
  In September 2016, we extended our waste services agreement with the City of Huntsville to September 2020.  In October, we extended our waste disposal agreement with the City of Indianapolis to December 2025.  Both were extended under similar terms of the existing agreements. 
   
  CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
  The following general discussions should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements, the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements and other financial information appearing and referred to elsewhere in this report. Additional detail relating to changes in operating revenue and operating expense and the quantification of specific factors affecting or causing such changes is provided in the segment discussion below.  We have one reportable segment, North America, which is comprised of waste and energy services operations located primarily in the United States and Canada. 
  The comparability of the information provided below with respect to our revenue, expense and certain other items for the periods presented was affected by several factors. As outlined in   Item 8. Financial Statements And Supplementary Data   Note 3. New Business and Asset Management   of our Annual Report on Form 10-K  ,   our business development initiatives, contract transitions, and acquisitions resulted in various transactions that are reflected in comparative revenue and expense. These factors must be taken into account in developing meaningful comparisons between the periods compared below.   
  The following terms used within the Results of Operations discussion are defined as follows: 
             
     Same store : reflects the performance at each facility on a comparable period-over-period basis, excluding the impacts of transitions and transactions. 
                
    Contract  transitions : includes the impact of the expiration of: (a) long-term major waste and service contracts, most typically representing the transition to a new contract structure, and (b) long-term energy contracts. 
                
     Transactions : includes the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, and the addition or loss of operating contracts.

Energy Revenue 
  Energy revenue and MWh by contract status and facility type (in millions): 

(1) Covanta share only. Represents the sale of electricity and steam based upon output delivered and capacity provided. 
  (2) Steam converted to MWh at an assumed average rate of 11 klbs of steam / MWh.  
    
  For the three month comparative period, energy revenue on a consolidated basis decreased by $16 million. 
  Energy revenue from EfW operations increased by $5 million year-over-year driven by contract transitions, which contributed $4 million     primarily due to additional energy revenue sharing, and an increase in same store revenue of $1 million.  
  Energy revenue from non-EfW operations decreased by $21 million, representing the contribution from biomass facilities and China operations in the prior year. 
      For the nine month comparative period, energy revenue on a consolidated basis decreased by $40 million. 
  Energy revenue from EfW operations increased $11 million year-over-year driven by contract transitions, which contributed $17 million     due to additional energy revenue sharing, partially offset by decreased same store revenue of $6 million, primarily due to lower energy production. 
  Energy revenue from non-EfW operations decreased by $51 million, representing the contribution from biomass facilities and China operations in the prior year.

     Table of Contents  

Recycled Metals Revenue 

(1) Covanta share only. 

For the three month comparative period, recycled metals revenue decreased by $2 million on both a consolidated and North America segment basis, primarily driven by lower market prices. 
  For the nine month comparative period, recycled metals revenue decreased by $6 million on both a consolidated and North America segment basis, primarily driven by lower market prices. 
  Other Operating Revenue 
  Other operating revenue increased $1 million and $4 million on a consolidated basis for the three month and nine month comparative period, respectively, primarily due to higher construction revenue related to facility improvement projects at the Pinellas County EfW facility, partially offset by decreased revenue from the Durham-York project and Honolulu expansion project, which have been completed. 
  Operating Expense 
  Plant Operating Expense 

(1)  
    Plant maintenance costs include our internal maintenance team and non-facility employee costs for facility scheduled and unscheduled maintenance and repair expense. 
     For the three month comparative period, plant operating expense on a consolidated and North America segment basis increased by $12 million and $19 million, respectively. 
  
   27 

     Table of Contents  

Plant operating expense for EfW operations in our North America segment increased by $11 million,   driven by higher plant maintenance expense ($4 million) related to plant outage activity in the quarter, escalation of other plant operating costs on a same store basis ($4 million), and higher expense resulting from transactions ($3 million)  . 
  Plant operating expense for non-EfW operations in our North America segment increased by $8 million primarily due to newly acquired environmental services businesses ($6 million) and higher incentive compensation ($9 million), partially offset by economically dispatching biomass facilities ($8 million). 
  Consolidated plant operating expense reflect an additional $7 million decrease due to the exchange of our ownership interests in a facility in China. 
  For the nine month comparative period, plant operating expense on a consolidated and North America segment basis increased by $52 million and $67 million, respectively. 
  Plant operating expense for EfW operations increased by $31 million, impacted by higher plant maintenance ($14 million), primarily related to the timing and scope of scheduled maintenance performed, other higher same store costs ($5 million), increased expense resulting from contract transitions ($6 million), and higher expense resulting from transactions ($6 million). 
  Plant operating expense for non-EfW operations in our North America segment increased by $36 million primarily due to newly acquired environmental services businesses ($28 million), the New York City MTS contract ($7 million), the start-up of our centralized metals processing facility ($4 million) and higher incentive compensation ($21 million), partially offset by economically dispatching biomass facilities ($25 million). 
  Consolidated plant operating expense reflect an additional $15 million decrease due to the exchange of ownership interests in a facility in China. 
  Other Operating Expense 
  Other operating expense in our North America segment decreased by $4 million and $10 million for the three and nine month comparative periods, respectively, primarily as a result of the completion of construction projects at the Honolulu and Durham-York EfW facilities, partially offset by construction activity at the Pinellas County EfW facility.    
  General and Administrative Expense 
  Consolidated general and administrative expense increased by $3 million for the three month comparative period primarily due to higher incentive compensation. 
  Consolidated general and administrative expense was flat for the nine month period. An approximate $5 million increase in incentive compensation was offset by decreased legal expense and expenses incurred in 2015 related to executive separation agreements. 
  Impairment Charges 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded impairment charges totaling $  19 million  . In March 2016, we exercised an early termination option available under the steam sale agreement at our Pittsfield EfW facility that would have been effective on or about March 2017.  Upon termination of the steam agreement, we intended to cease operations at the Pittsfield facility. As a result, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of   $13 million  , pre-tax, which was calculated based on the estimated cash flows for this facility during its remaining operations. 
  In June 2016, due to operational difficulties and a decline in the scrap metal market, we recorded an impairment to our investment in the Tartech joint venture of   $3 million  , pre-tax, which represented our portion of the carrying value in excess of the fair value of the entity. 
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we identified indicators of impairment associated with our biomass facilities, primarily due to a decline in energy market pricing. As a result of these recent developments, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of   $24 million  , pre-tax, which was calculated based on a range of potential outcomes utilizing various estimated cash flows for these facilities.  
  Operating Income 
  Operating income decreased by $14 million on a consolidated basis and decreased $9 million on a North America segment basis for the three month comparative period.  Operating income was negatively impacted by lower recycled metal market prices and higher incentive compensation, offset by the contribution of new businesses and, on a comparative basis, the profit reduction related to the Durham-York construction project that occurred in 2015. 
  
   28 

     Table of Contents  

Excluding the impairment charges discussed above, operating income decreased on a consolidated basis and North America segment basis by $20 million and $16 million, respectively, for the nine month comparative period.  Operating income was negatively impacted by lower recycled metal market prices, higher EfW plant operating expense, largely due to the timing and scope of scheduled maintenance performed, and higher incentive compensation; offset by the contribution of new businesses, higher EfW waste and service pricing, lower general and administrative expense (excluding incentive compensation) due to executive separation expense incurred in 2015, and the construction profit reduction for the Durham-York project in 2015. 

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   NON-OPERATING INCOME ITEMS  
  Three and Nine Month Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    
    
  Other Income (Expense): 

During the     nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded a gain of   $41 million   on the sale of our interests in China and a $2 million gain on the sale of a transfer station.  For additional information on the sale of our China investments, see   Note 3. Dispositions and Other  .  
    
  Income Tax (Expense) Benefit:    

  During the     nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the change in effective tax rate primarily resulted from the discrete impact of the sale of ownership interests in China, changes in the mix of earnings and the change from forecasted pre-tax income in 2015 to forecasted pre-tax loss in 2016.

Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Covanta Holding Corporation and Income (Loss) Per Share: 

Supplementary Financial Information   Adjusted Earnings Per Share ( Adjusted EPS ) (Non-GAAP Discussion) 
  We use a number of different financial measures, both United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and non-GAAP, in assessing the overall performance of our business. To supplement our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use the measure of Adjusted EPS, which is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). The non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EPS is not intended as a substitute or as an alternative to diluted earnings (loss) per share as an indicator of our performance or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes.  We use the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EPS to enhance the usefulness of our financial information by providing a measure which management internally uses to assess and evaluate the overall performance and highlight trends in the ongoing business. 
  Adjusted EPS excludes certain income and expense items that are not representative of our ongoing business and operations, which are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share in accordance with GAAP. The following items are not all-inclusive, but are examples of reconciling items in prior comparative and future periods. They would include the results of operations of our insurance subsidiaries, impairment charges, the effect of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, significant gains or losses from the disposition or restructuring of businesses, gains and losses on assets held for sale, transaction-related costs, income and loss on the extinguishment of debt and other significant items that would not be representative of our ongoing business. 
  In order to provide a meaningful basis for comparison, we are providing information with respect to our Adjusted EPS for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015  , reconciled for each such period to diluted loss per share, which is believed to be the most directly comparable measure under GAAP (in millions, except per share amounts):

(a) 
    During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded a non-cash impairment totaling   $19 million  , of which   $13 million   related to the planned closure of our Pittsfield EfW facility in March 2017 and   $3 million   related to an investment in a joint venture to recover and recycle metals. 
     During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   we recorded an impairment charge of our biomass assets totaling   $24 million  . 
  See   Results of Operations - Impairment charges   discussion above. 
           (b) 
    During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a   $41 million   gain on the sale of our interests in China.  See   Results of Operations - Non-operating Income Items - Other Income (Expense)   discussion above. 
              (c) 
    For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , comprised of costs incurred in connection with separation agreements related to the departure of two executive officers, of which $4 million related to non-cash compensation. 
              (d) 
    We calculate the federal and state tax impact of each item using the statutory federal tax rate and applicable blended state rate.   
      
  Supplementary Financial Information   Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP Discussion) 
  To supplement our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use the measure of Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC. This non-GAAP financial measure is described below, and is not intended as a substitute and should not be considered in isolation from measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our use of non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is intended to enhance the usefulness of our financial information by providing a measure which management internally uses to assess and evaluate the overall performance of its business and those of possible acquisition candidates, and highlight trends in the overall business. 
  We use Adjusted EBITDA to provide further information that is useful to an understanding of the financial covenants contained in the credit facilities of our most significant subsidiary, Covanta Energy, and as additional ways of viewing aspects of its operations that, when viewed with the GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of our core business. The calculation of Adjusted EBITDA is based on the definition in Covanta Energy s Credit Facilities, which we have guaranteed. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted for additional items subtracted from or added to net income. Because our business is substantially comprised of that of Covanta Energy, our financial performance is substantially similar to that of Covanta Energy. For this reason, and in order to avoid use of multiple financial measures which are not all from the same entity, the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and other financial measures presented herein are measured on a consolidated basis for continuing operations, less the results of operations of our insurance subsidiaries. Under the Credit Facilities, Covanta Energy is required to satisfy certain financial covenants, including certain ratios of which Adjusted EBITDA is an important component. Compliance with such financial covenants is expected to be the principal limiting factor which will affect our ability to engage in a broad range of activities in furtherance of our business, including making certain investments, acquiring businesses and incurring additional debt. Covanta Energy was in compliance with these covenants as of   September 30, 2016  . Failure to comply with such financial covenants could result in a default under the Credit Facilities, which default would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. 
  Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow provided by operating activities as indicators of our performance or liquidity or any other measures of performance or liquidity derived in accordance with GAAP.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES    
  Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, cash flow generated from our ongoing operations, and available capacity under our credit facilities, which we believe will collectively allow us to meet our liquidity needs.  For additional information regarding our credit facilities and other debt, see   Item 1. Financial Statements - Note 6. Consolidated Debt.   We typically receive cash distributions from our North America segment projects on a monthly basis. Our primary future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures to maintain our existing businesses, service our debt, invest in the growth of our business, and return capital to our shareholders. We believe that our liquidity position and ongoing cash flow from operations will be sufficient to finance these requirements for at least the next twelve months. 
  In 2016, we expect to generate net cash from operating activities which will meet or exceed our cash requirements for both capital expenditures to maintain our existing assets and for ongoing dividends to shareholders.  We intend to utilize existing cash balances and debt financing to fund investments in the growth of our business in 2016, including our committed investments in the Dublin EfW facility (utilizing non-recourse project financing arranged in 2014), the Essex County EfW facility (utilizing proceeds from the tax-exempt bond issuance completed in 2015), and other growth investments (utilizing our borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility).  In order to offset a portion of the indebtedness incurred to finance these investments in the growth of our business, as well as borrowings incurred to fund share repurchases completed in late 2015 and early 2016 (referenced above), we utilized approximately $50 million of the proceeds from the sale of our ownership interests in China to repay borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. For additional information regarding the financing arrangements referenced above, see   Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11. Consolidated Debt   of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  Beyond 2016, we expect that our financial results will be affected by several factors, including: market prices, contract transitions, new contracts, rates of new business growth in our environmental services operations, acquisitions and other growth investments, continuous improvement initiatives, and our ability to manage facility production and operating costs.  In addition, we expect our Dublin EfW facility to commence commercial operations in late 2017, after which we expect it to contribute meaningfully to our financial results. In addition, under our capital allocation policy, we intend to use any excess cash flow from operations above the amount of these on-going requirements to either invest in growth opportunities, repay indebtedness, and/or repurchase stock.  If and as we identify attractive growth investment opportunities that exceed our expected cash flow from operations, we will continue to consider utilizing debt financing to the extent that it is available in the market on acceptable terms. 
  We have substantial indebtedness, including $1.1 billion that will mature through 2020.  We generally intend to refinance these instruments prior to maturity with like-kind financing in the bank loan and/or debt capital markets in order to maintain a capital structure comprised primarily of long-term debt, which we believe appropriately matches the long-term nature of our assets and contracts.   
  The loan documentation governing the Credit Facilities contains various affirmative and negative covenants, as well as financial maintenance covenants (financial ratios), that limit our ability to engage in certain types of transactions. We were in compliance with all of the affirmative and negative covenants under the Credit Facilities as of   September 30, 2016  .    W  e do not anticipate our existing debt covenants to restrict our ability to undertake additional financing. 
  For additional information regarding the covenants under our Credit Facilities, see   Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data   Note 11. Consolidated Debt   of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  Other Factors Affecting Liquidity 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we held cash balances of   $113 million  , of which   $95 million   were held by international subsidiaries and not generally available for near-term liquidity in our domestic operations.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had restricted cash of   $119 million  , of which   $16 million   was designated for future payment of project debt principal.  Restricted funds held in trust are primarily amounts received and held by third-party trustees relating to certain projects we own. We generally do not control these accounts and these funds may be used only for specified purposes.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had unused and available capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility of   $468 million   and were in compliance with all of the covenants under our Credit Facilities.  For additional information regarding the Credit Facilities, see   Item 1. Financial Statements   Note 6. Consolidated Debt. 
   During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , dividends declared to stockholders were   $33 million  , or   $0.25   per share.  Such amounts were paid in October 2016.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   1.2 million   shares of our common stock at a weighted average cost of   $15.29   for an aggregate amount of   $18 million  . We expect to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time, the amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of operating, financing and other investing activities.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the amount remaining under our currently authorized share repurchase program was $  66   million.

Sources and Uses of Cash Flow for the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 
  Net cash provided by operating activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $146 million  , a   decrease   of   $8 million   from the prior year period. The   decrease   was primarily due to an increase in the Net loss attributable to Covanta Holding Corporation as discussed above in our   Results of Operations.    Net Loss Attributable to Covanta Holdings Corporation is adjusted for reconciling items. The reconciling items were driven by the $43 million gain on the sale of assets, primarily due to the sale of our interests in China, which was offset by a $25 million decrease in the adjustment for deferred income taxes, primarily attributable to the sale of our interests in China and changes to our current and deferred allocation approach for interim periods as compared to prior year.  
  Net cash used in investing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $178 million  , a net   decrease   of   $159 million   from the prior year period. The net   decrease   in cash used was principally attributable to proceeds related to the sale of interests in China of $105 million and reduced acquisition spending of $61 million, offset by increased purchases of property, plant and equipment totaling $15 million, primarily due to increased capitalized maintenance.   
  Net cash provided by financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $48 million  , a net   decrease   of   $119 million   from the prior period.  The   decrease   was primarily attributable to lower net borrowings under the revolving credit facility of   $111 million   and repurchases of common stock totaling   $20 million   during the period. 
   
  Supplementary Financial Information   Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP Discussion) 
  To supplement our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use the measure of Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP measure as defined by the SEC. This non-GAAP financial measure is not intended as a substitute and should not be considered in isolation from measures of liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our use of Free Cash Flow may be different from similarly identified non-GAAP measures used by other companies, limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes. The presentation of Free Cash Flow is intended to enhance the usefulness of our financial information by providing measures which management internally uses to assess and evaluate the overall performance of its business and those of possible acquisition candidates, and highlight trends in the overall business. 
  We use the non-GAAP financial measure of Free Cash Flow as a criterion of liquidity and performance-based components of employee compensation. Free Cash Flow is defined as cash flow provided by operating activities, excluding the cash flow provided by or used in our insurance subsidiaries, less maintenance capital expenditures, which are capital expenditures primarily to maintain our existing facilities. We use Free Cash Flow as a measure of liquidity to determine amounts we can reinvest in our core businesses, such as amounts available to make acquisitions, invest in construction of new projects, make principal payments on debt, or return capital to our stockholders through dividends and/or stock repurchases. For additional discussion related to management s use of non-GAAP measures, see   Consolidated Results of Operations   Supplementary Financial Information   Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS (Non-GAAP Discussion)   above. 
  In order to provide a meaningful basis for comparison, we are providing information with respect to our Free Cash Flow for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , reconciled for each such period to cash flow provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the most directly comparable measure under GAAP.

  Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  In preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP ), we are required to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Many of our critical accounting policies are subject to significant judgments and uncertainties which could potentially result in materially different results under different conditions and assumptions. Future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment. Management believes there have been no material changes during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   to the items discussed in   Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies   in   Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
   
  Item 3.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  In the normal course of business, our subsidiaries are party to financial instruments that are subject to market risks arising from changes in commodity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and derivative instruments. Our use of derivative instruments is very limited and we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes. 
  There have been no material changes during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   to the items discussed in   Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .   
   
  Item 4.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  
  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of Covanta s disclosure controls and procedures, as required by Rule 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) as of   September 30, 2016  . Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. 
  Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, based on their reviews, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide such reasonable assurance, because the previously reported material weaknesses discussed below have not yet been remediated. We have advised our audit committee of these deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, and the fact that these deficiencies constitute "material weaknesses." 
  A material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by our internal controls. 
  Because such material weaknesses were determined to exist, we performed additional procedures to ensure our consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q presented fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 
  As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, management may determine that it is necessary to take additional measures to address control deficiencies or may determine that it is necessary to modify the remediation plans described below. The operation of each of the control changes will need to be observed for a period of time  
  
   37 

     Table of Contents  

before management is able to conclude that the material weaknesses have been remediated. If not remediated, these material weaknesses could result in a material misstatement to our consolidated financial statements. Management continues to monitor implementation of its remediation plans and timetables and believes the efforts described below will effectively remediate both material weaknesses. 
  Income Taxes 
  During the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over the determination and reporting of the provision for state income taxes, and more specifically, over the precision of the review to ensure the accuracy of the state income tax rate applied to certain cumulative deferred tax balances. 
  Since first reporting this material weakness during the quarter ended June 30, 2015, we have continued to observe the operation of each of the control changes effected as part of our remediation efforts, for the purpose of evaluating their effectiveness over a period of time sufficient for management to conclude whether the reported material weakness has been remediated.  Although the control changes have been implemented, we have concluded that the period of time over which the operating effectiveness of newly implemented and modified controls was not yet sufficient for our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to conclude that this material weakness has been effectively remediated.   
  Municipally-Owned Facility Construction Accounting 
  During the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that we have not yet remediated the previously-reported material weakness relating to the estimation and timeliness of the reporting of certain costs on municipally-owned construction projects.  As originally reported during the quarter ended September 30, 2015, we did not maintain effective internal control over the estimation and timeliness of the reporting of certain costs associated with a maintenance outage conducted to perform certain remediation work on the Durham-York project and initial start-up operations of the project. At the time the material weakness was determined to exist in 2015, the Durham-York project was our only municipally-owned project in original construction or start-up, and is now completed and is in commercial operations.  When long-term construction revenue contracts for facilities that are municipally owned move to a projected net loss position, as the Durham-York contract did in the quarter ended June 30, 2015, all changes to the projected net loss are required to be recorded in the period those changes are identified. 
  During the quarter ended September 30, 2015, we estimated incremental costs for the Durham-York project expected to be incurred to conduct outages to modify certain equipment and to conduct initial start-up operations. During the quarter ended September 30, 2015, we determined that our prior estimate was not sufficiently accurate, and required refinement to our projected net loss. We determined that our inability to estimate such outage and start-up costs with sufficient accuracy during the period they were identified constituted a  material weakness  in our internal controls over financial reporting. 
  Since this material weakness was originally reported, we implemented several new controls and enhancements to existing controls, and commenced observation of the operation of each of the control changes, as previously disclosed, for the purpose of evaluating their effectiveness over a period of time sufficient for management to conclude whether the material weakness has been remediated.  We have also observed the operation and accuracy of our cost estimating procedures on our Dublin project (which is not a municipally-owned project), the extent to which those procedures were affected by the material weakness in cost estimating on municipally owned projects, and implemented the same improvements to the Dublin procedures in order to mitigate the potential for inaccuracies in our financial statements.  Although the control changes have been implemented, we have concluded that the period of time over which the operating effectiveness of newly implemented and modified controls was not yet sufficient for our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to conclude that this material weakness has been effectively remediated.   
  Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must consider the benefits of controls relative to their costs. Inherent limitations within a control system include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by unauthorized override of the control. While the design of any system of controls is to provide reasonable assurance of the effectiveness of disclosure controls, such design is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and such assumptions, while reasonable, may not take into account all potential future conditions. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be prevented or detected.
