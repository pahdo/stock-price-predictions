SPECIAL NOTE ON FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS  
   
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in Item 2 of Part I of this report include forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. 
   
 In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as  may,   should,   expects,   plans,   anticipates,   believes,   estimates,   predicts,   potential,   proposed,   intended,  or  continue  or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. You should read statements that contain these words carefully, because they discuss our expectations about our future operating results or our future financial condition or state other  forward-looking  information. There may be events in the future that we are not able to accurately predict or control. Before you invest in our securities, you should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this Quarterly Report could substantially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition, and that upon the occurrence of any of these events, the trading price of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, growth rates, levels of activity, performance or achievements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this Quarterly Report to conform these statements to actual results.

  NOTE   1  
  BASIS OF PRESENTATION  
   
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with both accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (   GAAP   ), and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in audited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading.  
   
 In the opinion of management, the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 which has been derived from audited financial statements and these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary to state fairly the results for the periods presented. The results for the period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire fiscal year ending December 31, 2016 or for any future period. 
   
 These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the Management   s Discussion and the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
   
  NOTE   2  
  ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS BACKGROUND  
   
 Innocom Technology Holdings, Inc. (the  Company  or  INCM ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 26, 1998. On June 20, 2006, the Company changed its name from  Dolphin Productions, Inc.  to  Innocom Technology Holdings, Inc.  
   
 We are a shell company with no or nominal operations. We are actively considering various acquisition targets and other business opportunities. We hope to acquire one or more operating businesses or consummate a business opportunity within the next twelve months. 
   
 INCM and its subsidiaries are hereinafter referred to as (the    Company   ). 
   
  NOTE   3  
  GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTIES  
   
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. 
   
 For the period ended September 30, 2016, the Company has experienced a continuous loss of $106,846 with an accumulated deficit of $13,393,327 as of that date. The continuation of the Company as a going concern through September 30, 2016 is dependent upon the continued financial support from its stockholders. Management believes this funding will continue, and is also actively seeking new investors. Management believes the existing stockholders will provide the additional cash to meet the Company s obligations as they become due, and will allow its planned principal business to commence and assembly the production lines of mobile handsets and components in the PRC. 
   
 These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern. 
   
  NOTE   4  
  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the application of certain significant accounting policies as described in this note and elsewhere in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and notes. 

Shell company 
   
 The Company has ceased all of its business and is currently considered as a shell company. 

Use of estimates 
   
 In preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheets and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

INNOCOM TECHNOLOGY HOLDINGS, INC.  
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  
  (Currency expressed in United States Dollars ( US$ ), except for number of shares)  
  (Unaudited)  

Basis of consolidation 
   
 The condensed consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of INCM and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and transactions within the Company have been eliminated upon consolidation. 

Cash and cash equivalents 
   
 Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments. 

Comprehensive income or loss 
   
 ASC Topic 220,   Comprehensive Income   establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income or loss, its components and accumulated balances. Comprehensive income or loss as defined includes all changes in equity during a period from non-owner sources. Accumulated comprehensive income or loss, as presented in the accompanying consolidated statement of stockholders  deficit consists of changes in unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translation. This comprehensive income or loss is not included in the computation of income tax expense or benefit. 

Income taxes 
   
 The Company adopts ASC Topic 740   Income Taxes  , regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which prescribes the recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. In addition, the guidance requires the determination of whether the benefits of tax positions will be more likely than not sustained upon audit based upon the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are determined to be more likely than not sustained upon audit, a company recognizes the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements. For tax positions that are not determined to be more likely than not sustained upon audit, a company does not recognize any portion of the benefit in the financial statements. The guidance provides for de-recognition, classification, penalties and interest, accounting in interim periods and disclosure. 
   
   The Company did not have any unrecognized tax positions or benefits and there was no effect on the financial condition or results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to local and various foreign tax jurisdictions. The Company s tax returns remain open subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions. 

Net loss per share 
   
 The Company calculates net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260,   Earnings per Share  . Basic loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. 

Foreign currencies translation 
   
 Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in the statement of operations. 
   
 The reporting currency of the Company is United States Dollars ( US$ ). The Company s subsidiaries operating in Hong Kong and the PRC maintained their books and records in their local currency, Hong Kong Dollars ( HK$ ) and Renminbi Yuan ( RMB ), which are functional currencies as being the primary currency of the economic environment in which these entities operate. 
   
 In general, assets and liabilities are translated into US$, in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30,   Translation of Financial Statement  , using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders  equity.

  FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  
  (Currency expressed in United States Dollars ( US$ ), except for number of shares)  
  (Unaudited)  
   
 Translation of amounts from RMB and HK$ into US$1 has been made at the following exchange rates for the respective period: 

Related parties 
   
 Parties, which can be a corporation or individual, are considered to be related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Companies are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence. 

Fair value of financial instruments 
   
 The carrying value of the Company s financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, prepayments and other receivables, accounts payable, amount due to a related party, other payables and accrued liabilities approximate at their fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments.  
   
 The Company also follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   ( ASC 820-10 ), with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:  

Level 1  : Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;  

Level 2  : Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and  

Level 3  : Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions  
   
 Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.  

Recent accounting pronouncements 
   
 The Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations. 
   
  NOTE   5  
  AMOUNT DUE TO A RELATED PARTY  
   
 As of September 30, 2016, the balance represented temporary advances made by a director and a major shareholder of the Company, Mr. William Hui, which was unsecured, interest-free with no fixed repayment term. 
   
  NOTE   6  
  INCOME TAXES  
   
 The Company operates in various countries: United States, British Virgin Island, Hong Kong and the PRC that are subject to taxes in the jurisdictions in which they operate, as follows: 
   
  United States of America  
   
 The Company is registered in the State of Nevada and is subject to United States current tax law. 
   
  British Virgin Island

  The PRC  
   
 The Company s subsidiaries in the PRC are subject to the unified income rate of 25% on the taxable income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company generated no operating result and accordingly, no provision for income tax has been recorded.

  History  
   
 Innocom Technology Holdings, Inc. (the  Company  or  INCM ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 26, 1998. 
   
 On June 20, 2006, the Company changed its name from  Dolphin Productions, Inc.  to  Innocom Technology Holdings, Inc.  
   
 On January 19, 2007, Changzhou Innocom Communication Technology Limited is incorporated and registered in the People s Republic of China ( the PRC ). 
   
 On May 16, 2007, the Company purchased a 10 year mobile phone manufacturing license in a consideration of RMB45 million (approximately $5,770,000) and annual license fee of RMB500,000 (approximately $64,000). 
   
 On May 8, 2008, the Company completed the establishment of a new subsidiary, Changzhou Innocom Communication Technology Limited in the PRC upon the approval of its local government. 
   
 In February 2009, the Company temporarily ceased its principal operation in the manufacturing facility in Changzhou City, Zhejiang Province, the PRC. Starting from the fourth quarter 2008, global economic conditions deteriorated significantly across the countries and the demand for communication products and components was adversely slowed down. During such challenging economic times, the Company temporarily discontinued operation in the manufacture of mobile communication products and components in the PRC. The Company intends to continue to operate the manufacturing facility depending upon the market recovery condition and demands from the customers. 
   
 In February 2012, we established a new Hong Kong subsidiary company, named Lead Faith International Trading Limited, to explore possible trading business. We disposed of this subsidiary at cost in April 2012.  
   
 On September 17, 2013, the Company filed an amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State to our Articles of Incorporation authorizing an increase of our authorized common stock from 50,000,000 common shares to 490,000,000 common shares, par value $0.001 and authorizing 10,000,000 preferred shares, par value $0.001 per share. 
   
  Overview and Future Plan of Operations  
   
 In February 2009, the Company determined to have a temporary closure in the manufacturing facility in Changzhou City, Zhejiang Province, the PRC. Starting from the fourth quarter 2008, global economic conditions have deteriorated significantly across the countries and the demand for communication products and components was adversely slowed down. During such challenging economic times, the Company has discontinued operation in the manufacture of mobile communication products and components in the PRC. However, the Company has no intention to dispose of the production facilities. We are seeking production contracts, both volume and operating contribution of which warrant us to start the production facilities again. We have expended several million dollars establishing our manufacturing facilities. Despite the fact that we have written down the value of the manufacturing facility we have no intention to dispose of it. We continue to seek out production contracts for the facility. We will need to privately offer and sell shares in order to finance initial working capital should we resume production. 

13 

In February 2012, we established a new Hong Kong subsidiary company, named Lead Faith International Trading Limited, to explore possible trading business. We disposed of this subsidiary at cost at end of April 2012 because after further review we considered the subsidiaries business model as not viable. 
   
  Results of Operations for Three Months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 and Nine Months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015  
   
  Revenue  
   
 As a result of the discontinuance of business and operations in the manufacturing of mobile communication products and components in the PRC, no revenue was recorded during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
   
  Cost of Sales  
   
 As a result of the discontinuance of business and operations in the manufacturing of mobile communication products and components in the PRC, no cost of sales was recorded during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
   
  Administrative Expenses  
   
 Administrative expenses mainly included salaries and professional fees. 
   
  Net Loss  
   
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we experienced a net loss of $29,440 compared to a net loss of $31,211 for three months ended September 30, 2015. Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $106,846 compared to net loss of $109,046 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
   
 Losses for both three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 represent the total general and administrative expenses for the periods. The losses for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are more or less the same of the loss for both the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015. This is attributable to no change in administrative expenses. 
   
  Trends, Events, and Uncertainties  
   
 N/A 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources for Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  
   
  Cash flows from operating activities  
   
 We experienced negative cash flows used in operations in the amount of $44,010 for nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with negative cash flow used in the operations in the amount of $73,049 for nine months ended September 30, 2015. The reason for this reduction in negative cash flow was due to the increase of other payable and accruals for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
   
 As the Company did not have any income during both periods, the cash flows used in operations representing general and administrative expenses were paid by William Hui, the Company s Chief Executive Officer. 
   
  Cash flows from investing activities  
   
 During nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had no investing activities. 
   
 During nine months ended September 30, 2015, we had no investing activities. 
   
  Cash flows from financing activities  
   
 During nine months ended September 30, 2016 we obtained financing from a related party in the amount of $43,625. 
   
 During nine months ended September 30, 2015 we repaid a portion of a loan to a related party in the amount of $8,364. 
   
 These advances are in nature of interest free loans under oral agreement without repayment period. Future repayment depends upon future profitable operations or may be made by the issuance of common shares. 

14 

Liquidity  
   
 On a long-term basis, our liquidity will be dependent on establishing profitable operations, receipt of revenues, additional infusions of capital and additional financing. If necessary, we may raise capital through an equity or debt offering. The funds raised from this offering will be used to develop and execute our business plan. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing in the future, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital, our growth potential will be adversely affected. Additionally, we may have to significantly modify our plans. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies  
   
 The financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related footnotes. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. We do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below. However, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. 
   
 Details of critical accounting policies are set out in notes to the financial statements included in Item 1. 
   
  Employees   
   
 As of September 30, 2016, we had 2 full-time employees employed in Hong Kong.
