1. Description of Business     

CRA International, Inc. ("CRA") is a worldwide leading consulting services firm that applies advanced analytic techniques and in-depth industry knowledge to complex engagements
for a broad range of clients. CRA offers its services in two broad areas: legal, regulatory, and financial consulting and management consulting.   

2. Basis of Presentation and Estimates     

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the results of operations, financial position, cash flows, and stockholders' equity as of and for the
fiscal quarters and year-to-date periods ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015, respectively. These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and
regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, these financial statements do not include all of the information and note
disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") for annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, these financial
statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature necessary for the fair statement of CRA's results of operations, financial position, cash flows, and
stockholders' equity for the interim periods presented in conformity with GAAP. Results of operations for the interim periods presented herein are not necessarily indicative of results of operations
for a full year. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended January 2, 2016 included in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 4, 2016.   

          The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Estimates in these condensed consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, allowances for accounts receivable and unbilled services, revenue recognition on fixed price
contracts, depreciation of property and equipment, share-based compensation, valuation of acquired intangible assets, impairment of long lived assets, goodwill, accrued and deferred income taxes,
valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, accrued compensation, accrued exit costs, and other accrued expenses. These items are monitored and analyzed by CRA for changes in facts and circumstances,
and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. CRA bases its estimates on historical experience and
various other assumptions that CRA believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from those estimates if CRA's assumptions based on past experience or other assumptions
do not turn out to be substantially accurate.   

3. Principles of Consolidation     

The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CRA and its wholly owned subsidiaries. In addition, the condensed consolidated financial statements include CRA's
interest in NeuCo, Inc. Effective April 13, 2016, NeuCo's name was changed to GNU123 Liquidating Corporation ("GNU") in connection with the sale of its assets described below. All
significant intercompany accounts have been eliminated.

CRA International, Inc.    

    Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    

    (Unaudited)    

3. Principles of Consolidation (Continued)    

          CRA's
ownership interest in GNU was 55.89% for all periods presented. GNU's financial results have been consolidated with CRA, and the portion of GNU's results allocable to its other
owners is shown as "noncontrolling interest." Additionally, a member of CRA's board of directors holds a greater than 5% interest in GNU.   

GNU's
interim reporting schedule is based on calendar month-ends, but its fiscal year end is the last Saturday of November. CRA's quarterly results could include a few days reporting lag
between CRA's quarter end and the most recent financial statements available from GNU. CRA does not believe that the reporting lag will have a significant impact on CRA's consolidated income
statements or financial condition.   

          On
January 8, 2015, GNU entered into an agreement to settle a note payable of approximately $981,000 in exchange for aggregate payments of $375,000. GNU recorded a gain on the
extinguishment of this debt in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 of approximately $606,000. Under the settlement order, the scheduled payments were made as follows: $150,000 on January 8, 2015
and $150,000 on February 28, 2015. The final payment of $75,000 was paid on February 16, 2016.   

          On
April 13, 2016, a buyer acquired substantially all of the business assets and assumed substantially all of the liabilities of GNU for a purchase price of $1.35 million.
Of this amount, $1.1 million was received at closing, with the remaining $0.25 million payable on or after April 13, 2017, subject to contingencies, as outlined in the asset
purchase agreement. GNU recognized a gain on sale of its business assets of $3.8 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2016, of which $2.1 million is attributed to CRA.   

4. Recent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted     

Statement of Cash Flows     

          In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-15     Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):
Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.    The amendments in this update provide guidance on eight
specific cash flow issues. The amendments in this update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal
years. CRA is currently evaluating the potential effects, if any, that the adoption of ASU 2016-15 may have on the presentation of its cash flows.   

Revenue from Contracts with Customers     

          On May 9, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers   
(Topic 606):    Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients   . The relevant amendments in this ASU affect only the following aspects of Topic
606: (1) collectability criterion in Step 1, (2   )    presentation of sales taxes collected from customers in the transaction price,
(3) non-cash consideration, and (4) Contract Modifications at Transition. CRA is currently evaluating the potential effects, if any, that the adoption of ASU 2016-12 may have on its
financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or disclosures.

4. Recent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted (Continued)    

          On
April 14, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers    (Topic 606):     Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,    which clarifies two aspects of the guidance on identifying performance obligations and the licensing
implementation guidance while maintaining the principles in those areas. CRA is currently evaluating the potential effects, if any, that the adoption of ASU 2016-10 may have on its financial position,
results of operations, cash flows, or disclosures.   

          In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers    (Topic 606):     Principal versus Agent Considerations    ("ASU
2016-08"). ASU 2016-08 clarifies the provisions of principal versus agent implementation. ASU 2016-08
requires entities to determine whether they are a principal or agent for each distinct good or service they provide to customers. The new standard also clarifies the assessment necessary to determine
whether the entity is acting as a principal or agent based on contract and customer. For a public entity, the amendments in this update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted. CRA is currently evaluating the potential effects, if any, that the adoption of
ASU 2016-08 may have on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or disclosures.   

          In
August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers    (Topic 606):     Deferral of the Effective Date    ("ASU 2015-14").
ASU 2015-14 defers by one year the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09,     Revenue from Contracts with Customers    ("ASU 2014-09"). The deferral results in ASU 2014-09 being effective for fiscal years,
and interim periods within
those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The main provision of ASU 2014-09 is
to recognize revenue when control of the goods or services transfers to the customer, as opposed to the existing guidance of recognizing revenue when the risks and rewards transfer to the customer.
CRA is currently evaluating the potential effects, if any, that the adoption of ASU 2015-14 may have on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or disclosures.   

Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting     

          In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,    Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718):
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ("   ASU 2016-09"). ASU 2016-09 establishes new classification for excess tax benefits and deficiencies relating to
share based payments. In addition, the new pronouncement allows for the option of estimating awards expected to vest or accounting for forfeitures when they occur. Cash paid by employers when
withholding shares for tax withholding purposes will now be classified as a financing
activity. For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early
adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the
fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. CRA is currently evaluating the potential effects, if any, that
the adoption of ASU 2016-09 may have on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or disclosures.

4. Recent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted (Continued)    

Leases (Topic 842)     

          In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,    Leases (Topic 842)    ("ASU 2016-02").
ASU 2016-02 establishes a comprehensive new lease accounting model. The new standard clarifies the definition of a lease, requires a dual approach to lease classification similar to current
lease classifications, and causes lessees to recognize leases on the balance sheet as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use asset for leases with a lease term of more than twelve months.
The new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard requires a modified retrospective transition for
capital or operating leases existing at or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, but it does not require transition accounting for
leases that expire prior to the date of initial application. CRA is currently reviewing existing lease agreements and evaluating the potential effects, if any, that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 may
have on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or disclosures.   

Reporting of Going-Concern Uncertainties     

          In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,    Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern
(Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern    ("ASU 2014-15"). ASU 2014-15 is intended to define management's
responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization's ability to continue as a going concern and provides guidance to an organization's management, with principles and
definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures in the financial statement footnotes. ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after
December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is
permitted. CRA believes that the adoption of ASU 2014-15 will not have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or disclosures.   

5. Cash and Cash Equivalents     

Cash and cash equivalents consist principally of money market funds with maturities of three months or less when purchased. As of October 1, 2016, a substantial portion of CRA's
cash accounts was concentrated at a single financial institution, which potentially exposes CRA to credit risks. The financial institution has a short-term credit rating of A-2 by Standard  
Poor's ratings services. CRA has not experienced any losses related to such accounts. CRA does not believe that there is significant risk of non-performance by the financial institution, and its cash
on deposit is fully liquid. CRA continually monitors the credit ratings of the institution.   

6. Fair Value of Financial Instruments     

Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 820,    Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,   
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities (Level 1 measurement), then priority to quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active
and model-based valuation techniques

  for
which all significant assumptions are observable in the market (Level 2 measurement), then the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement).   

          The
following table shows CRA's financial instruments as of October 1, 2016 and January 2, 2016 that are measured and recorded in the financial statements at fair value on

The
fair values of CRA's money market funds are based on quotes received from third-party banks.   

          The
contingent acquisition liability in the tables above is for estimated future contingent consideration payments related to a prior acquisition. The fair value measure of this
liability is based on significant inputs not observed in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements of this
contingent acquisition liability are CRA's measures of the estimated payouts based on internally generated financial projections and discount rates. The fair value of the contingent acquisition
liability is reassessed on a quarterly basis by CRA using additional information as it becomes available and any change in the fair value estimate is recorded in the earnings of that period.

10. Credit Agreement     

CRA is party to a credit agreement that provides CRA with a $125.0 million revolving credit facility and a $15.0 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. CRA
may use the proceeds of the revolving credit facility to provide working capital and for other general corporate purposes. CRA may repay any borrowings under the revolving credit facility at any time,
but no later than April 24, 2018. There were no borrowings outstanding under this revolving line of credit as of October 1, 2016.   

          As
of October 1, 2016, the amount available under this revolving line of credit was reduced by certain letters of credit outstanding, which amounted to $2.2 million. Under
the credit agreement, CRA must comply with various financial and non-financial covenants. Compliance with these financial covenants is tested on a quarterly basis. As of October 1, 2016, CRA
was in compliance with the covenants of its credit agreement.   

11. Revenue Recognition     

CRA offers consulting services in two broad areas: legal, regulatory, and financial consulting and management consulting. Together, these two service areas comprised approximately 100.0%
and 99.7% of CRA's consolidated revenues for the fiscal quarter and fiscal year-to-date period ended October 1, 2016, respectively, and approximately 0.0% and 0.3% of CRA's consolidated
revenues for these periods, respectively, came from its GNU subsidiary. CRA recognizes all project revenue on a gross basis based on consideration of the criteria set forth in ASC Topic 605-45,     Principal Agent
Considerations   .   

          The
contracts that CRA enters into and operates under specify whether the engagement will be billed on a time-and-materials or a fixed-price basis. Most of CRA's revenue is derived from
time-and-materials service contracts. Revenues from time-and-materials service contracts are recognized as services are provided based upon hours worked and contractually agreed-upon hourly rates, as
well as indirect fees based upon hours worked. Revenues from a majority of CRA's fixed-price engagements are recognized on a proportional performance method based on the ratio of costs incurred,
substantially all of which are labor-related, to the total estimated project costs. In general, project costs are classified in costs of services and are based on the direct salary of the consultants
on the engagement plus all direct expenses incurred to complete the engagement, including any amounts billed to CRA by its non-employee experts.   

          CRA's
billed and unbilled receivables consist of receivables from a broad range of clients in a variety of industries located throughout the U.S. and in other countries. CRA performs a
credit evaluation of its clients to minimize its collectability risk. Periodically, CRA will require advance payment from certain clients. However, CRA does not require collateral or other security.
CRA maintains accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses and disputed amounts resulting from clients' failures to make required payments. CRA bases its estimates on historical collection
experience, current trends, and credit policy. In determining these estimates, CRA examines historical write-offs of its receivables and reviews client accounts to identify any specific customer
collection issues. If the financial condition of any of CRA's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability or intent to make payment, additional allowances may be
required.

12. Net Income per Share     

CRA calculates basic and diluted earnings per common share using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated to each class of common stock and
participating security as if all of the net earnings of the period had been distributed. CRA's participating securities consist of unvested share-based payment awards that contain a nonforfeitable
right to receive dividends

  and
therefore are considered to participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders. Basic earnings per common share excludes dilution and is calculated by dividing net earnings allocable
to common shares by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net earnings allocable to common shares by the
weighted-average number of common shares as of the balance sheet date, as adjusted for the potential dilutive effect of non-participating share-based awards. Net earnings allocable to these
participating securities were not significant for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015.

For
the third quarter and fiscal year-to-date period ended October 1, 2016, the anti-dilutive share based awards that were excluded from the calculation of common stock
equivalents for purposes of computing diluted weighted average shares outstanding amounted to 205,015 and 680,950 shares, respectively. For the third quarter and fiscal year-to-date period ended
October 3, 2015, the anti-dilutive share based awards that were excluded from the calculation of common stock equivalents for purposes of computing diluted weighted average shares outstanding
amounted to 431,992 and 398,382 shares, respectively. These share-based awards were anti-dilutive because their exercise price exceeded the average market price over the respective period.

12. Net Income per Share (Continued)    

          On
October 23, 2014 and March 21, 2016, CRA's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $30.0 million and $20.0 million, respectively, of CRA's
common stock. Repurchases under these programs are discretionary and CRA may make repurchases under any of these programs in the open market (including under any Rule 10b5-1 plan adopted by
CRA) or in privately negotiated transactions, in each case in accordance with applicable insider trading and other securities laws and regulations. CRA records the retirement of its repurchased shares
as a reduction to common stock. During the third quarter and fiscal year-to-date period ended October 1, 2016, CRA repurchased and retired 110,908 shares and 783,703 shares, respectively, under
these share repurchase programs at an average price per share of $25.84 and $24.33, respectively. During the third quarter and fiscal year-to-date period ended October 3, 2015, CRA repurchased
and retired 125,000 shares and 388,800 shares, respectively, under these share repurchase programs at an average price per share of $22.76 and $27.83, respectively. There was approximately
$9.0 million available for future repurchases under these programs as of October 1, 2016.   

13. Income Taxes     

CRA's effective income tax rates were 37.7% and 35.3% for the third quarters of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 was
higher than the prior year primarily due to discrete items that benefited the third quarter fiscal 2015 rate, the majority of which related to the revaluing of CRA's US deferred tax assets, partially
offset by a more favorable geographical mix of earnings in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. The effective tax rate in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 was lower than the combined Federal and state
statutory tax rate due to a favorable geographical mix of earnings. The effective tax rate in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 was lower than the combined Federal and state statutory tax rate and
included favorable rate drivers resulting from a favorable geographical mix of earnings and the use of valuation allowances, offset by the tax treatment of contingent consideration and other permanent
tax differences. Additionally, there were several discrete items in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 that benefited the rate, the majority of which related to the revaluing of CRA's US deferred tax
assets.   

          CRA's
effective income tax rates were 34.3% and 38.0% for the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. The effective tax rate for the first three quarters of
2016 was lower than the prior year primarily due to a more favorable geographical mix of earnings as well as the gain on sale of
business assets of GNU of approximately $3.8 million, resulting in a disproportionately lower share of taxes as the gain was offset by net operating losses that had a full valuation allowance.
However, the lower effective tax rate in the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 as compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2015 was partially lessened by benefits realized owing to a
non-recurring valuation allowance and the revaluing of CRA's US deferred tax assets in the prior year.   

          The
effective tax rate in the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 was lower than the combined Federal and state statutory tax rate primarily due to a favorable geographical mix of
earnings, as well as the sale of GNU's business assets described above. The effective tax rate in the first three quarters of fiscal 2015 was slightly lower than the combined Federal and state
statutory tax rate and included favorable rates drivers resulting from the geographical mix of earnings, the use of valuation allowances, and benefit related to revaluing of CRA's US deferred tax
assets, offset by the tax treatment of contingent consideration and other permanent tax differences. Additionally, there was a discrete benefit

13. Income Taxes (Continued)    

  in
the first three quarters of 2015 related to prior period true-ups primarily as a result of a decrease in a statutory withholding tax rate.   

CRA
has not provided for deferred income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings from its foreign subsidiaries as of October 1, 2016 because such earnings are
considered to be indefinitely reinvested. CRA does not rely on these unremitted earnings as a source of funds for its domestic business, as it expects to have sufficient cash flow and availability
from its U.S. revolving credit facility to fund its U.S. operational and strategic needs. If CRA were to repatriate its foreign earnings that are indefinitely reinvested, it would incur minimal
additional tax expense.   

          As
of January 2, 2016, CRA had an approximate $1,265,000 balance of unrecognized tax benefits, of which, approximately $195 thousand was expected to reverse within twelve
months. As of October, 1, 2016, CRA had an approximately $1,549,000 balance of unrecognized tax benefits, of which approximately $518 thousand was expected to reverse within twelve months.   

14. Contingencies     

CRA is subject to legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In management's opinion, CRA believes it has adequate legal defenses and/or insurance coverage with respect to
the eventuality of such actions. CRA does not believe any settlement or judgment relating to any pending legal action would materially affect its financial position or results of operations.   

15. Subsequent Events     

On October 26, 2016, CRA's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 per common share, payable on December 16, 2016 to shareholders of record as of
November 20, 2016.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates     

          The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("U.S. GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make significant
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements, and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates in these condensed consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, allowances for accounts
receivable and unbilled services, revenue recognition on fixed price contracts, depreciation of property and equipment, share-based compensation, valuation of acquired intangible assets, impairment of
long lived assets, goodwill, accrued and deferred income taxes, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, accrued compensation, accrued exit costs, and other accrued expenses. These items are
monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which
they become known. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from our estimates
if our assumptions based on past experience or our other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate.   

We
have described our significant accounting policies in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2015, which
was filed with the SEC on March 4, 2016. We have reviewed our accounting policies, identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated
financial statements in the list set forth below. See the disclosure under the heading "Critical Accounting Policies" in Item 7 of Part II of our annual report on Form 10-K for
fiscal 2015 for a detailed description of these policies and their potential effects on our results of operations and financial condition.

Results of Operations For the Quarter and Fiscal Year-to-Date Period Ended
October 1, 2016, Compared to the Quarter and Fiscal Year-to-Date Period Ended October 3, 2015     

          The following table provides operating information as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated:

Table of Contents   

Quarter Ended October 1, 2016 Compared to the Quarter Ended October 3, 2015     

            Revenues.       Revenues increased by $5.2 million, or 6.8%, to $81.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 from
$76.5 million
for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Revenue growth was attributable to the increase in consulting headcount of 34 to 541 at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2016 from 507 at the end of the
third quarter of fiscal 2015 while utilization remained flat at 73% for the third quarters of fiscal 2016 and 2015. An increase of $0.6 million in client reimbursable expenses, which are
pass-through expenses that carry little to no margin, was also a factor in the increased revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015. GNU's revenue
declined by $1.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015 due to the cessation of its operations in April 2016.   

          Overall,
revenues outside of the U.S. represented approximately 22% and 20% of total revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and the third quarter of fiscal 2015, respectively.
Revenues derived from fixed-price engagements increased to 18% of total revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 compared with 11% for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. These percentages of
revenue derived from fixed- price engagements depend largely on the proportion of our revenues derived from our management consulting business, which typically has a higher concentration of
fixed-price service contracts.   

            Costs of Services.       Costs of services increased by $5.8 million, or 11.2%, to $57.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal
2016 from
$52.0 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The increase in costs of services was due primarily to an increase of $1.8 million in employee compensation and fringe benefit costs
attributable to salaries and benefits for our increased consulting headcount, an increase in incentive and retention compensation costs of $2.6 million and an increase in forgivable loan
amortization of $0.6 million. Additionally, client reimbursable expenses increased by $0.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015. As a
percentage of revenues, costs of services increased to 70.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 from 68.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 due primarily to the previously mentioned increase in
employee compensation and fringe benefit costs as more revenue was sourced by employees rather than consultants in the third
quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015. GNU's cost of services declined by $0.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, principally due to the cessation of its
operations in April 2016.   

           Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.       Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $1.7 million, or 9.2%, to
$16.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 from $18.4 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. A significant contributor to this decrease was a reduction in commissions to
our nonemployee experts of $1.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015 as a lower percentage of our revenue for the quarter was sourced by
our nonemployee experts. Partially offsetting this reduction is higher incentive compensation expense of $0.2 million relative to the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Additionally, selling,
general and administrative expense for GNU decreased by $0.7 million to $0.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 from $0.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, due
to the cessation of its operations in April 2016.   

          As
a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 20.4% for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 from 24.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 due
primarily to the aforementioned decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses and the increase in revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 as compared with the third quarter of fiscal
2015. Commissions to our nonemployee experts decreased to 2.4% of revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to 4.1% of revenues for third quarter of fiscal 2015 as less revenue was
sourced by nonemployee experts in the third quarter of fiscal 2016.

            Provision for Income Taxes.       The income tax provision was $1.9 million, and the effective tax rate was 37.7%, for the third quarter
of fiscal
2016 compared to $1.5 million and 35.3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 was higher than the prior year primarily due to
discrete items that benefited the third quarter fiscal 2015 rate, the majority of which related to the revaluing of our U.S. deferred tax assets, partially offset by a more favorable geographical mix
of earnings in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. The effective tax rate in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 was lower than the combined Federal and state statutory tax rate due to a favorable
geographical mix of earnings. The effective tax rate in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 was lower than the combined Federal and state statutory tax rate and included favorable rate drivers resulting
from a favorable geographical mix of earnings and the use of valuation allowances, offset by the tax treatment of contingent consideration and other permanent tax differences. Additionally, there were
several discrete items in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 that benefited the rate, the majority of which related to the revaluing of our U.S. deferred tax assets.   

            Net Loss (Income) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest, Net of Tax.       Our ownership interest in GNU was 55.89% for the third quarters
of fiscal 2016
and fiscal 2015. GNU's financial results are consolidated with ours, and allocations of the noncontrolling interest's share of GNU's net income result in deductions to our net income, while
allocations of the noncontrolling interest's share of GNU's net loss result in additions to our net income. The results of operations of GNU allocable to its other owners was a net loss of
$42 thousand for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and a net loss of $47 thousand for the third quarter of fiscal 2015.   

            Net Income Attributable to CRA International, Inc.       Net income attributable to CRA International, Inc. increased by
$0.3 million
to $3.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 from $2.9 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The net income per diluted share was $0.38 per share for the third quarter of
fiscal 2016, compared to $0.31 of net income per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by approximately 716,000 shares to
approximately 8,309,000 shares for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 from approximately 9,025,000 shares for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The decrease in diluted weighted average shares
outstanding was primarily due to the repurchase and retirement of shares of our common stock since the third quarter of fiscal 2015, offset in part by an increase as a result of shares of restricted
stock and time-vesting restricted stock units that have vested or that have been issued, and stock options that have been exercised, since the third quarter of fiscal 2015.   

Fiscal Year-to-Date Period Ended October 1, 2016 Compared to the Fiscal Year-to-Date Period
Ended October 3, 2015     

           Revenues.       Revenues increased by $14.1 million, or 6.1%, to $245.2 million for the fiscal year-to-date period ended
October 1,
2016 from $231.1 million for the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 3, 2015. Revenue growth was driven by an increase in average consulting headcount in the fiscal year-to-date
period ended October 1, 2016 compared to the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 3, 2015 while utilization remained flat at 75% for the fiscal year-to-date periods ended
October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015. Offsetting this increase, GNU had a decrease in revenue of $2.0 million in the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 1, 2016
compared with the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 3, 2015, principally due to the cessation of its operations in April 2016.   

          Overall,
revenues outside of the U.S. represented approximately 23% and 20% of total revenues for the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 1, 2016 and the fiscal year-to-date
period ended October 3, 2015, respectively. Revenues derived from fixed-price engagements were 17% and 14% of total revenues for the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 1, 2016 and
the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 3, 2015, respectively. These percentages of revenue derived from fixed-price

  engagements
depend largely on the proportion of our revenues derived from our management consulting business, which typically has a higher concentration of fixed-price service contracts.   

            Costs of Services.       Costs of services increased by $14.8 million, or 9.5%, to $171.3 million for the fiscal year-to-date
period ended
October 1, 2016 from $156.5 million for the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 3, 2015. These increased costs were driven by the salaries and fringe benefits of our
increased consulting headcount, as well as increases in incentive compensation and forgivable loan amortization. As a percentage of revenues, costs of services increased to 69.9% for the fiscal
year-to-date period ended October 1, 2016 from 67.7% for the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 3, 2015 due primarily to the previously mentioned increase in employee compensation
and fringe benefit costs as more revenue was sourced by employees rather than consultants in the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 as compared with the first three quarters of fiscal 2015. GNU's
costs of services declined during the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 1, 2016 by $0.6 million, principally due to the cessation of its operations in April 2016.   

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.       Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $2.4 million, or 4.4%, to
$52.7 million for the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 1, 2016 from $55.1 million for the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 3, 2015. A significant
contributor to this decrease was a reduction in commissions to our nonemployee experts of $1.0 million for the year-to-date period ended October 1, 2016 compared to the year-to-date
period ended October 3, 2015, as a lower percentage of our revenue for the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 1, 2016 was sourced by our nonemployee experts as compared to the
fiscal year-to-date period ended October 3, 2015. In addition, there was an overall decrease in rent expense of $0.5 million due to higher double rent payments related to our Boston,
Massachusetts office of $1.3 million for the year-to-date period ended October 3, 2015 compared to the double rent payments related to our London office of $0.7 million for the
year-to-date period ended October 1, 2016. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expense for GNU decreased by $1.3 million to $1.1 million for the fiscal year-to-date
period ended October 1, 2016 from $2.4 million for the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 3, 2015, due to the cessation of its operations in April 2016. Partially offsetting
these cost reductions were increases in professional fees of $1.0 million for the year-to-date period ended October 1, 2016 compared to the year-to-date period ended October 3,
2015.   

          As
a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 21.5% for the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 1, 2016 from 23.8% for fiscal
year-to-date period ended October 3, 2015 due primarily to the decrease in the previously mentioned selling, general and administrative expenses and the increase in revenues. Commissions to our
nonemployee experts decreased to 2.8% of revenues for the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 1, 2016 compared to 3.4% of revenues for fiscal year-to-date period ended October 3,
2015 as less revenue was sourced by nonemployee experts in the third quarter of fiscal 2016.   

GNU Gain on Extinguishment of Debt.       On January 8, 2015, GNU entered into an agreement to settle a note payable of approximately
$981,000 in
exchange for aggregate payments of $375,000. GNU recorded a gain on the extinguishment of this debt in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 of approximately $606,000. Under the settlement order, the
scheduled payments were made as follows: $150,000 on January 8, 2015 and $150,000 on February 28, 2015. The final payment of $75,000 was paid on February 16, 2016.   

            GNU Gain on Sale of Business Assets.       On April 13, 2016, a buyer acquired substantially all of the business assets and assumed
substantially
all of the liabilities of GNU for a purchase price of $1.35 million. Of this amount, $1.1 million was received at closing, with the remaining $0.25 million payable on or after
April 13, 2017, subject to contingencies, as outlined in the asset purchase agreement. GNU recognized a gain on sale of its business assets of $3.8 million during the second quarter of
fiscal 2016, of which $2.1 million is attributed to CRA.

Other Expense, Net.       Other expense, net decreased by $270,000 to $270,000 for the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 1, 2016
as compared
to $540,000 for the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 3, 2015. Other expense, net consists primarily of foreign currency exchange transaction gains and losses. We continue to manage our
foreign currency exchange exposure through frequent settling of intercompany account balances and by self-hedging movements in exchange rates between the value of the dollar and foreign currencies
including the Euro, the British Pound, and the Canadian Dollar. Additionally, our multi-currency credit facility allows us to mitigate such foreign exchange exposures.   

Provision for Income Taxes.       For the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 1, 2016, our income tax provision was
$6.4 million, and
the effective tax rate was 34.3%, compared to a provision of $5.5 million and an effective tax rate of 38.0% for the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 3, 2015. The effective tax
rate for the first three quarters of 2016 was lower than the prior year primarily due to a more favorable geographical mix of earnings, as well as the gain on the sale of business assets of GNU of
approximately $3.8 million, resulting in a disproportionately lower share of taxes as the gain was offset by net operating losses that had a full valuation allowance. However, the lower
effective tax rate in the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 was partially lessened by benefits realized owing to a non-recurring valuation allowance and the revaluing of our U.S. deferred tax assets
in the prior year. The effective tax rate in the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 was lower than the combined Federal and state statutory tax rate primarily due to a favorable geographical mix of
earnings, as well as the sale of GNU's business assets described above. The effective tax rate in the first three quarters of fiscal 2015 was slightly lower than the combined Federal and state
statutory tax rate and included favorable rate drivers resulting from the geographical mix of earnings, the use of valuation allowances, and benefit related to revaluing of our U.S. deferred tax
assets, offset by the tax treatment of contingent consideration and other permanent tax differences. Additionally, there was a discrete benefit year-to-date related to prior period true-ups primarily
as a result of a decrease in a statutory withholding tax rate.   

            Net Loss (Income) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest, Net of Tax.       Our ownership interest in GNU was 55.89% for the fiscal
year-to-date period
ended October 1, 2016 and the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 3, 2015. GNU's financial results are consolidated with ours and allocations of the noncontrolling interest's share
of GNU's net income result in deductions to our net income, while allocations of the noncontrolling interest's share of GNU's net loss result in additions to our net income. The results of operations
of GNU allocable to its other owners was net income of $1.3 million for the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 1, 2016, primarily as a result of the gain on sale attributable to
its other owners of $1.7 million and a net loss of $50 thousand for the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 3, 2015.   

            Net Income Attributable to CRA International, Inc.       Net income attributable to CRA International, Inc. increased by
$1.8 million
to $10.8 million for the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 1, 2016 from $9.0 million for the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 3, 2015. The diluted net income
per share was $1.24 per share for the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 1, 2016, compared to diluted net income per share of $0.97 per share for the fiscal year-to-date period ended
October 3, 2015. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by approximately 529,000 shares to approximately 8,653,000 shares for the fiscal year-to-date period ended
October 1, 2016 from approximately 9,182,000 shares for the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 3, 2015. The decrease in diluted weighted average shares outstanding was primarily
due to the repurchase and retirement of shares of our common stock since October 3, 2015, offset in part by an increase as a result of shares of restricted stock and time-vesting restricted
stock units that have vested or that have been issued, and stock options that have been exercised, since October 3, 2015.

Liquidity and Capital Resources     

Fiscal Year-to-Date Period Ended October 1, 2016      

We believe that current cash, cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and amounts available under our existing revolving credit
facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months.   

General.       In the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 1, 2016, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $13.0 million. We
completed
the period with cash and cash equivalents of $25.2 million and working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) of $62.8 million. The principal drivers of the
reduction in cash were the payment of a significant portion of our fiscal 2015 performance bonuses during the first half of fiscal 2016, the repurchase and retirement of 783,703 shares of our common
stock during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2016, and increased capital expenditures related principally to outfitting our new office space in Washington, DC and New York for occupancy in the
first quarter of fiscal 2016, and in London for occupancy in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. During the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 1, 2016, cash and cash equivalents for GNU
increased by $0.9 million, to $1.1 million at October 1, 2016, from $0.2 million at January 2, 2016. This increase was due to the receipt of $1.1 million from
its sale of business assets in April 2016, partially offset by operating expenses and transaction costs incurred during the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 1, 2016.   

          Of
the total cash and cash equivalents of $25.2 million at October 1, 2016, $10.4 million was held within the U.S. We have sufficient sources of cash in the U.S. to
fund U.S. cash requirements without the need to repatriate any funds.   

          As
of October 1, 2016, a substantial portion of our cash accounts was concentrated at a single financial institution, which potentially exposes us to credit risks. The financial
institution has a short-term credit rating of A-2 by Standard   Poor's ratings services. We have not experienced any losses related to such accounts. We do not believe that there is significant
risk of non-performance by the financial institution, and our cash on deposit at this financial institution is fully liquid. We continually monitor the credit ratings of such institution. A change in
the credit worthiness of this financial institution could materially affect our liquidity and working capital.   

Sources and Uses of Cash.     

During the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 1, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $16.2 million. Net
income was $12.2 million for the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 1, 2016. The primary factor in cash used in operations was the increase in accounts receivable and unbilled
services of $15.5 million. Other uses of cash included the reversal of the $3.8 million gain on sale of GNU's business assets. Cash provided by operating activities included the reversal
of non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization of $5.8 million and share-based compensation of $4.8 million. The net decrease in forgivable loans for the fiscal year-to-date
period ended October 1, 2016 of $7.7 million was primarily driven by $13.0 million of forgivable loan amortization and repayments, less $5.3 million of forgivable loan
issuances. The change in deferred rent of $3.3 million was primarily driven by tenant improvement allowances to the new New York, NY lease.   

          During
the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 1, 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $10.7 million which included $4.3 million and
$1.7 million for capital expenditures related principally to outfitting our new office space in New York, NY and Washington, DC, respectively, for occupancy beginning in the first quarter of
fiscal 2016. In addition, $4.0 million was used for capital expenditures related to the new office space in London for occupancy beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. We also used cash
of $1.5 million for capital expenditures related to computer equipment and software. Offsetting these uses of cash was $1.1 million of cash proceeds received from the sale of GNU's
business assets.   

  25  

Table of Contents    

          We used $18.4 million of net cash in financing activities during the fiscal year-to-date period ended 2016, primarily for the repurchase and retirement of
shares of our common stock of $19.3 million and the redemption of approximately $0.5 million in vested employee restricted shares for tax withholdings. Additionally, GNU made a payment
of $0.1 million on its note payable during the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Offsetting these uses of cash was $1.4 million received upon the issuance of shares of common stock related
to the exercise of stock options.   

Indebtedness      

We are party to a credit agreement that provides us with a $125.0 million revolving credit facility and a $15.0 million sublimit
for the issuance of letters of credit. We may use the proceeds of the revolving credit facility to provide working capital and for other general corporate purposes. Generally, we may repay any
borrowings under the revolving credit facility at any time, but must repay all borrowings no later than April 24, 2018. There were no borrowings outstanding under this revolving credit facility
as of October 1, 2016.   

          The
amount available under this revolving credit facility is reduced by certain letters of credit outstanding, which amounted to $2.2 million as of October 1, 2016.   

          Borrowings
under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum, at our election, of either (i) the adjusted base rate, as defined in the credit agreement, plus
an applicable margin, which varies between 0.50% and 1.50% depending on our total leverage ratio as determined under the credit agreement, or (ii) the adjusted eurocurrency rate, as defined in
the credit agreement, plus an applicable margin, which varies between 1.50% and 2.50% depending on our total leverage ratio. We are required to pay a fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit
facility at a rate per annum that varies between 0.25% and 0.375% depending on our total leverage ratio. Borrowings under the credit facility are secured by 100% of the stock of certain of our U.S.
subsidiaries and 65% of the stock of certain of our foreign subsidiaries, which represent approximately $12.4 million in net assets as of October 1, 2016.   

          Under
the credit agreement, we must comply with various financial and non-financial covenants. Compliance with these financial covenants is tested on a fiscal quarterly basis. Any
indebtedness outstanding under the revolving credit facility may become immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of stated events of default, including our failure to pay principal, interest or
fees or a violation of any financial covenant. The financial covenants require us to maintain an adjusted consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense ratio of more than 2.5 to 1.0 and to
comply with a consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated EBITDA ratio of not more than 3.0 to 1.0. The non-financial covenant restrictions of the senior credit agreement include, but are not limited
to, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, engage in acquisitions or dispositions, and enter into business combinations.   

Forgivable Loans and Term Loans      

In order to attract and retain highly skilled professionals, we may issue forgivable loans or term loans to employees and non-employee experts.
A portion of these loans is collateralized. The forgivable loans have terms that are generally between three and eight years. The principal amount of forgivable loans and accrued interest is forgiven
by us over the term of the loans, so long as the employee or non-employee expert continues employment or affiliation with us and complies with certain contractual requirements. The expense associated
with the forgiveness of the principal amount of the loans is recorded as compensation expense over the service period, which is consistent with the term of the loans.   

  26  

Table of Contents   

Compensation Arrangements      

We have entered into compensation arrangements for the payment of incentive performance awards to certain of our non-employee experts and
employees if specific performance targets are met. The amounts of the awards to be paid under these compensation arrangements could fluctuate depending on future performance through the respective
measurement periods. Changes in the estimated award are expensed prospectively over the remaining service period. We believe that we will have sufficient funds to satisfy any obligations related to
the incentive performance awards. We expect to fund these payments, if any, from existing cash resources, cash generated from operations, or borrowings on our existing revolving credit facility.   

Business Acquisitions      

As part of our business, we regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire other consulting firms, practices or groups or other businesses. In
recent years, we have typically paid for acquisitions with cash, or a combination of cash and our common stock, and we may continue to do so in the future. To pay for an acquisition, we may use cash
on hand, cash generated from our operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, or we may pursue other forms of financing. Our ability to secure short-term and long-term debt or equity
financing in the future, including our ability to refinance our current senior loan agreement, will depend on several factors, including our future profitability, the levels of our debt and equity,
restrictions under our existing revolving credit facility with our bank, and the overall credit and equity market environments.   

Share Repurchases      

On October 23, 2014 and March 21, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $30.0 million, and
$20.0 million, respectively, of our common stock. Repurchases
under these programs are discretionary and we may make such purchases under any of these programs in the open market (including under any Rule 10b5-1 plan adopted by us) or in privately
negotiated transactions, in each case in accordance with applicable insider trading and other securities laws and regulations. During the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 1, 2016, we
repurchased and retired 783,703 shares under these programs at an average price per share of $24.33. Approximately $9.0 million was available for future repurchases as of October 1,
2016.   

          We
will finance these programs with available cash, cash from future operations and funds from our existing revolving credit facility. We expect to continue to repurchase shares under
these programs.   

Tender Offer      

On February 22, 2016, we announced the commencement of a modified "Dutch auction" self-tender offer to purchase, for cash, up to
$30.0 million in value of shares of our common stock at a price within (and including) the range of $18.00 to $19.75 per share. The tender offer expired on Monday, March 21, 2016. A
total of 1,164 shares of common stock were tendered at the final purchase price of $19.75 per share.   

Dividends to Shareholders      

Our Board of Directors declared our first quarterly dividend on our common stock on October 26, 2016, and we anticipate paying regular
quarterly dividends each year. These dividends are anticipated to be funded through cash flow from operations, available cash on hand, and/or borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Although
we anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, the declaration of any future dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors.

Impact of Inflation      

To date, inflation has not had a material impact on our financial results. There can be no assurance, however, that inflation will not adversely
affect our financial results in the future.   

Future Capital and Liquidity Needs      

We anticipate that our future capital and liquidity needs will principally consist of funds required
for:  

operating and general corporate expenses relating to the operation of our business, including the compensation of our employees under various
annual bonus or long-term incentive compensation programs;   
            the hiring of individuals to replenish and expand our employee base;   
            capital expenditures, primarily for information technology equipment, office furniture and leasehold improvements;    
            debt service and repayments, including interest payments on borrowings from our existing revolving credit facility;    
            share repurchases;   
            dividends to shareholders;   
            potential acquisitions of businesses that would allow us to diversify or expand our service offerings;    
            contingent obligations related to our acquisitions; and   
            other known future contractual obligations.    

The
hiring of individuals to replenish and expand our employee base is an essential part of our business operations and has historically been funded principally from operations. Many of
the other above activities are discretionary in nature. For example, capital expenditures can be deferred, acquisitions can be forgone, and share repurchase programs and regular dividends can be
suspended. As such, our operating model provides flexibility with respect to the deployment of cash flow from operations. Given this flexibility, we believe that our cash flows from operations,
supplemented by cash on hand and borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility (as necessary), will provide adequate cash to fund our long-term cash needs from normal operations for at least
the next twelve months.   

          Our
conclusion that we will be able to fund our cash requirements by using existing capital resources and cash generated from operations does not take into account the impact of any
future acquisition transactions or any unexpected significant changes in the number of employees or other expenditures that are currently not contemplated. The anticipated cash needs of our business
could change significantly if we pursue and complete additional business acquisitions, if our business plans change, if economic conditions change from those currently prevailing or from those now
anticipated, or if other unexpected circumstances arise that have a material effect on the cash flow or profitability of our business. Any of these events or circumstances, including any new business
opportunities, could involve significant additional funding needs in excess of the identified currently available sources and could require us to raise additional debt or equity funding to meet those
needs on terms that may be less favorable compared to our current sources of capital. Our ability to raise additional capital, if
necessary, is subject to a variety of factors that we cannot predict with certainty, including:  

our future profitability;   
            the quality of our accounts receivable;   
            our relative levels of debt and equity; and    
 
  28  

Table of Contents   

the volatility and overall condition of the capital markets; and the market prices of our securities.    

Contractual Obligations     

          On May 20, 2016, we, as guarantor, and our wholly owned UK subsidiary CRA International (UK) Limited, as tenant, entered into two leases
for new office space in London, UK with Mitsubishi Estate London Limited, as landlord, for 22,990 square feet of office space located on the fourth floor and part of the ground floor of the office
building located at 8 Finsbury Circus in London. Following an initial rent-free period, annual fixed rent for the office space will be  0.2 million for the ground floor space, which
our UK subsidiary will begin paying on November 13, 2017, and  1.4 million for the fourth floor space, which our UK subsidiary will begin paying on July 13, 2018 (in
each case, excluding insurance costs, VAT and other customary
operating costs and expenses for which our UK subsidiary will be responsible). The rent under each lease is subject to increase every five years, based on rental market conditions at that time. The
landlord has agreed to pay an aggregate amount of  0.1 million plus VAT to cover various costs incurred by our UK subsidiary in connection with the building out of the leased
properties. Each lease has a 15-year term, which expires on May 19, 2031. Subject to certain conditions, the lease for the ground floor will be terminable by us after 10 years.   

Factors Affecting Future Performance     

          Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements we make in Part II,
Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as a description of material risks we face, are set forth under the heading "Risk Factors" included in Part I-Item 1A
of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 2, 2016 filed with the SEC on March 4, 2016. If any of these risks, or any risks not presently known to us or that we
currently believe are not significant, develops into an actual event, then our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.    

ITEM 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk            

          For information regarding our exposure to certain market risks see "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,"
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2016.    

ITEM 4.    Controls and Procedures            

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures     

          Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report to provide reasonable assurance that we record, process, summarize
and report the information we must disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.
Based upon that evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of October 1,
2016, due to the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to the inadequate and ineffective analysis and review of the allocation of GNU's net income (loss) to
noncontrolling interest and other deficiencies in the financial statements close process described in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
January 2, 2016.   

          Notwithstanding
the material weakness, management has concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material aspects, our
financial position,   

  29  

Table of Contents   

  results
of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.   

Evaluation of Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting     

          Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
Officer, we evaluated whether there were any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of fiscal 2016.   

Other
than with respect to the ongoing remediation of the material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting related to the allocation of GNU's net income (loss) to
noncontrolling interest and other deficiencies in the financial statement close process pursuant to the plan described in Item 9A of
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2016, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the above
evaluation that occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.   

In
April 2016, a buyer acquired substantially all of the business assets of GNU, formerly NeuCo, resulting in GNU's ceasing its operations. Though we have incorporated GNU into our
remediation plan, this transaction reduces the significance of those elements of the material weakness related to GNU's ongoing operations on our system of internal controls over financial reporting.   

Important Considerations     

          The effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent
limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of human error, and the
risk of fraud. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and the risk that
the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time. Because of these limitations, there can be no assurance that any system of disclosure controls and procedures or
internal control over financial reporting will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management.   

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION     

ITEM 1.    Legal Proceedings            

          None.    

ITEM 1A.    Risk Factors            

          Apart from the additional risk factor included below, there have been no material changes in any risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 2, 2016 filed with the SEC on March 4, 2016. See "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
January 2, 2016 for a complete description of the material risks we face.   

There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends at all or in any particular
amounts.     

          Our board of directors declared our first quarterly dividend on our common stock on October 26, 2016. Although we anticipate paying
regular quarterly dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors, and is restricted by applicable state
law limitations on distributions to shareholders. As a result, the amount, if any, of the dividends to be paid by us in the future depends upon a number of factors,   

  30  

Table of Contents   

  including
but not limited to our available cash on hand, anticipated cash needs, overall financial condition, future prospects for earnings and cash flows, as well as other factors considered relevant
by our board of directors. In addition, our board of directors may also suspend the payment of dividends at any time. Any reduction or suspension in our dividend payments could adversely affect the
price of our common stock.

following table provides information about our repurchases of shares of our common stock during the fiscal quarter ended October 1, 2016. During that period,
we did not act in concert with any affiliate or any other person to acquire any of our common stock and, accordingly, we do not believe that purchases by any such affiliate or other person (if any)
are reportable in the following table. For purposes of this table, we have divided the fiscal quarter into three periods of four weeks, four weeks, and five weeks, respectively, to coincide with our
reporting periods during the third quarter of fiscal 2016.   

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities            

(1)    On
October 23, 2014 and March 21, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors approved share repurchase programs of up to $30.0 million and
$20.0 million, respectively, of our common stock. We may repurchase shares under these programs in open market purchases (including under any Rule 10b5-1 plan adopted by us) or in
privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable insider trading and other securities laws and regulations. During the four weeks ended July 30, 2016, we repurchased and retired
110,908 shares under these programs at an average price per share of $25.84. Approximately $9.0 million was available for future repurchases under these programs as of October 1, 2016.
We expect to continue to repurchase shares under these programs.

registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act
Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 (f) and 15d-15 (f)) for the registrant and have:   

a)    Designed
such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material
information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being
prepared;   

          b)    Designed

in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the
registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial
reporting; and   

5.     The
registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's
auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):   

a)    All
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to affect
adversely the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and   

          b)    Any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
