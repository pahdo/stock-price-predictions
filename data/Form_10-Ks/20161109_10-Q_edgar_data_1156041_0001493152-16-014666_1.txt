NOTE
1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Houston American Energy Corp., a Delaware corporation (the  Company ),
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial
information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q. They do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America for a complete financial presentation. In the opinion of management,
all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation, have been included
in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements. Operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.  

These
unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial
statements and footnotes, which are included as part of the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Going
Concern   

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern,
which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business for the twelve-month
period following the date of these consolidated financial statements. The Company has incurred continuing losses, negative operating
cash flow and declining cash balances since 2011, including negative operating cash flow of $1,023,200 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. These conditions, together with continued low oil and natural gas prices and financial commitments the Company
has made relative to its Colombian properties, raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue
as a going concern.  

To
address these concerns, the Company may seek additional financing or may consider divestiture of certain assets. There can be
no assurance that the Company will be successful in its efforts.  

Consolidation   

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include all accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries (HAEC Louisiana E P,
Inc., HAEC Oklahoma E P, Inc. and HAEC Caddo Lake E P, Inc.). All significant inter-company balances and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.  

Accounting
Principles and Use of Estimates   

The
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. In preparing financial statements, management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates, including those related to such potential
matters as litigation, environmental liabilities, income taxes and the related valuation allowance, determination of proved reserves
of oil and gas and asset retirement obligations. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual
results may differ from these estimates.  

Concentration
of Credit Risk   

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk include cash, cash equivalents and any marketable
securities. The Company had cash deposits of $494,077 in excess of the FDIC s current insured limit on interest bearing
accounts of $250,000 as of September 30, 2016. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cash equivalents.  

Loss
per Share   

Basic
loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding
for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to
issue common shares were exercised or converted into common shares that then shared in the earnings of the Company. The Company s
only outstanding potentially dilutive securities are options and warrants. Using the treasury stock method, outstanding  in-the-money 
options would have increased our diluted weighted average shares outstanding by approximately 55,600 shares for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and by approximately 55,600 shares for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015;
however, due to losses during these periods, these options were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation because
their effect would have been anti-dilutive.  

Subsequent
Events   

The
Company has evaluated all transactions from September 30, 2016 through the financial statement issuance date for subsequent event
disclosure consideration.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

No
accounting standards or interpretations issued recently are expected to a have a material impact on our consolidated financial
position, operations or cash flows.  

NOTE
2   ESCROW RECEIVABLE   

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s consolidated balance sheets reflected the following current escrow
receivables relating to various oil and gas properties previously held by the Company:  

NOTE
3   OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company invested $92,217 for the development of oil and gas properties, consisting
of (1) preparation and evaluation costs in Colombia of $67,966, and (2) costs on U.S. properties of $24,251. Of the amount invested,
the Company capitalized $24,251 to oil and gas properties subject to amortization, and $67,966 to oil and gas properties not subject
to amortization.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company disposed of a portion of its interest in three non-producing domestic prospects
for proceeds of $56,705. Proceeds received from disposal of such interests were accounted for as a reduction in capitalized cost
of oil and gas properties.  

Geographical
Information   

The
Company currently has operations in two geographical areas, the United States and Colombia. Revenues for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and long lived assets (net of depletion, amortization, and impairments) as of September 30, 2016 attributable
to each geographical area are presented below:  

NOTE
4   STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE   

The
Company periodically grants options to employees, directors and consultants under the Company s 2005 Stock Option Plan and
the Company s 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (together, the  Plans ). The Company is required to make estimates
of the fair value of the related instruments and recognize expense over the period benefited, usually the vesting period.  

Stock
Option Activity   

In
March 2016, options to purchase an aggregate of 20,000 shares were granted to non-employee directors. The options were granted
in connection with service on an ad hoc board committee and vest on the earlier of August 15, 2016, the termination of the committee
or termination of service on the committee due to death or disability. The options have a five-year life and an exercise price
of $0.1982 per share. The options were valued on the date of grant at $2,896 using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with
the following parameters: (1) risk-free interest rate of 1.49%; (2) expected life in years of 4.99; (3) expected stock volatility
of 106.95%; (4) expected dividend yield of 0%; and (5) forfeiture rate of 15.22%. The Company determined the options qualify as
 plain vanilla  under the provisions of SAB 107 and the simplified method was used to estimate the expected option
life.  

In
June 2016, options to purchase an aggregate of 800,000 shares were granted to non-employee directors. The options, which included
a one-time supplemental grant to purchase an aggregate of 600,000 shares, were granted in connection with service on the board
of directors. 200,000 of the options granted to non-employee directors vested 20% on the grant date and vest as to the remaining
80% nine months from the grant date, have a ten-year life and have an exercise price of $0.2201 per share. Those option grants
were valued on the date of grant at $32,640 using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following parameters: (1) risk-free
interest rate of 1.26%; (2) expected life in years of 5.28; (3) expected stock volatility of 108.5%; (4) expected dividend yield
of 0%; and (5) forfeiture rate of 15.01%. 600,000 of the options granted to non-employee directors vest (i) 50% on the earlier
of June 7, 2017 or the day preceding the next annual shareholders meeting at which directors are elected, (ii) 50% on the earlier
of June 7, 2018 or the day preceding the second annual shareholders meeting (after the grant date) at which directors are to be
elected, and (iii) in the event that the Company consummates a transaction(s) (after the option grant date) in the nature of a
sale of shares of equity securities for cash or assets resulting in a net addition(s) to the Company s stockholders 
equity of not less than $2 million, all unvested options vest in full. Those options have a ten-year life and have an exercise
price of $0.2201 per share. Those option grants were valued on the date of grant at $83,421 using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model with the following parameters: (1) risk-free interest rate of 1.26% (2) expected life in years of 5.28, and (3) expected
stock volatility of 108.5%. The Company determined the option qualifies as  plain vanilla  under the provisions of
SAB 107 and the simplified method was used to estimate the expected option life.  

A
summary of stock option activity and related information for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is presented below:  

Shares
available for issuance under the Plans as of September 30, 2016 totaled 767,835 shares.  

Share-Based
Compensation Expense   

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized $37,805 and $99,006, respectively, of stock compensation
expense attributable to the amortization of unrecognized stock-based compensation.  

As
of September 30, 2016, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested stock options was $157,804. The
unrecognized expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.36 years and the weighted average remaining
contractual term of the outstanding options and exercisable options at September 30, 2016 is 6.6 years and 5.46 years, respectively.  

The
following table reflects share-based compensation recorded by the Company for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

NOTE
5 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   

Lease
Commitment   

The
Company leases office facilities under an operating lease agreement that expires on May 31, 2017. As of September 30, 2016, the
lease agreement requires future payments as follows:  

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the total base rental expense was $26,935 and $81,076, respectively. The Company
does not have any capital leases or other operating lease commitments.  

NOTE
6   TAXES   

The
Company has estimated that its effective tax rate for U.S. purposes will be zero for 2016, and consequently, recorded no U.S.
income tax liability or tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, significant temporary differences between financial statement net loss and
estimated taxable income related primarily to the stock compensation expense recognized for book purposes during the period.  

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

Forward-Looking
Information   

This
Form 10-Q quarterly report of Houston American Energy Corp. (the  Company ) for the nine months ended September 30,
2016, contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created
thereby. To the extent that there are statements that are not recitations of historical fact, such statements constitute forward-looking
statements that, by definition, involve risks and uncertainties. In any forward-looking statement, where we express an expectation
or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable
basis, but there can be no assurance that the statement of expectation or belief will be achieved or accomplished.  

The
actual results or events may differ materially from those anticipated and as reflected in forward-looking statements included
herein. Factors that may cause actual results or events to differ from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements included
herein include the Risk Factors described in Item 1A herein and in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Readers
are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date
hereof. We believe the information contained in this Form 10-Q to be accurate as of the date hereof. Changes may occur after that
date, and we will not update that information except as required by law in the normal course of our public disclosure practices.  

Additionally,
the following discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and related notes contained in Item 1 of Part 1 of this Form 10-Q, as well as the Risk Factors in Item 1A and the financial
statements in Item 7 of Part II of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We believe
certain critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial
statements. A description of our critical accounting policies is set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
As of, and for the nine months ended, September 30, 2016, there have been no material changes or updates to our critical accounting
policies.  

Unevaluated
Oil and Gas Properties   

Unevaluated
oil and gas properties not subject to amortization, include the following at September 30, 2016:  

Of
the carrying value of unevaluated oil and gas prospects above, $2,181,340 was attributable to properties in the South American
country of Colombia and $765,689 was attributable to properties in the United States. We are maintaining our interest in these
properties and development has or is anticipated to commence within the next twelve months.  

Recent
Developments   

Drilling
and Related Activity   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we drilled no wells and, at September 30, 2016, no drilling operations were ongoing.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our capital investment expenditures totaled $92,217 principally relating to the preparation
and evaluation of our three concessions in Colombia.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Hupecol, the operator of our Colombian concessions, continued to experience opposition,
at the local level, to their efforts to secure necessary permits to commence drilling operations on our Serrania concession. Commencement
of drilling operations remains contingent upon receipt of final permits in Colombia. Notwithstanding the federal government s
grant of the concession, local opposition to drilling in the vicinity of the Serrania concession has resulted in repeated delays
in issuance of, including the issuance and subsequent rescission of, necessary permits and there is no assurance as to if, and
when, necessary permits will be issued or the concession will be drilled and/or developed. While Hupecol continues to pursue discussions
with the government regarding issuance of permits or compensation should the necessary permits not be forthcoming, given the continuing
permitting issues, we, through Hupecol, are evaluating our rights and options with respect to Serrania and have shelved plans
to drill the concession in 2016 and for the foreseeable future. Hupecol is also expected to defer commencement of work on the
Los Picachos and Macaya concessions until satisfactory resolution of the permitting issues on the Serrania concession.  

In
June 2016, a peace accord was announced between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, also
known as FARC. The peace accord was ultimately rejected in a popular referendum although both government and FARC representatives
have indicated a desire to cease all hostilities and seek to arrive at an acceptable final peace accord. While there is no assurance
as to how the peace initiative will, or will not, impact our assets, we are reevaluating our plans regarding our Colombian assets
in light of the peace initiatives and the potential of the same to enhance our prospects of arriving at a favorable resolution
to the impasse that has prevented the commencement of drilling operations on our Colombian properties.  

Termination
of Planned Tamboran Investment   

In
February 2016, we agreed to acquire a 12.5% equity ownership interest in Tamboran Resources Limited for $1,000,000. Closing of
the planned acquisition of the interest in Tamboran was subject to satisfaction of certain conditions by Tamboran, including the
receipt by Tamboran of funding from investors other than Houston American Energy in an amount not less than $705,000. Tamboran
failed to satisfy one of the conditions of closing the investment and, effective June 30, 2016, our agreement to purchase an equity
ownership interest in Tamboran was terminated.  

Strategic
Alternatives   

In
May 2016, our board approved the exploration of strategic alternatives, including, among other options, seeking merger and acquisition
candidates, asset acquisitions or sales. To facilitate our exploration of strategic alternatives, in June 2016, we engaged an
investment banking firm, to assist in making merger and acquisition introductions, negotiating deals, capital sourcing and other
supporting services. We subsequently terminated our engagement of the investment banking firm but continue our exploration of
strategic alternatives.  

Supplemental
Director Option Grants   

In
light of the limited cash compensation paid to non-employee directors and the anticipated increased demands on non-employee directors
associated with the search for and consideration of strategic alternatives, in June 2016, in addition to ordinary annual option
grants to non-employee directors, we granted supplemental stock options pursuant to which each of the non-employee directors may
acquire up to 150,000 shares of common stock (or an aggregate of 600,000 shares) for a term of ten years at an exercise price
of $0.2201 per share. The supplement options vest: (i) 50% on the earlier of June 7, 2017 or the day preceding the next annual
shareholders meeting at which directors are elected, (ii) 50% on the earlier of June 7, 2018 or the day preceding the second annual
shareholders meeting (after the grant date) at which directors are to be elected, and (iii) in the event that the Company consummates
a transaction(s) (after the option grant date) in the nature of a sale of shares of equity securities for cash or assets resulting
in a net addition(s) to the Company s stockholders  equity of not less than $2 million, all unvested options vest
in full.

and Gas Revenues.  Total oil and gas revenues decreased by 68% to $39,738 in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to $124,448 in the three months ended September 30, 2015. Oil and gas revenues decreased 64% to $121,885 in the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to $340,541 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in revenue was due to a steep
decline in average realized oil prices (down 30% for the 2016 nine-month period from the same period in 2015) and average realized
natural gas prices (down 34% for the 2016 nine-month period from the same period in 2015) and a 53% decline in crude oil production
and a 30% decline in natural gas production.  

The
following table sets forth the gross and net producing wells, net oil and gas production volumes and average hydrocarbon sales
prices for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

The
change in average sales prices realized reflects a steep decline in global commodity prices from 2015 and continuing into 2016.
The decline in crude oil production reflects natural decline rates and termination, during 2015, of production on two wells that
were no longer economical to produce at current commodity prices.  

Oil
and gas sales revenues by region were as follows:  

Lease
Operating Expenses.  Lease operating expenses decreased by 56% to $23,054 during the three months ended September 30, 2016
from $52,652 during the three months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, lease operating
expenses decreased by 46% to $60,416 from $112,300 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in lease operating
expenses was attributable to operation of fewer wells during the 2016 periods and receipt of a severance tax abatement on one
well during 2016.  

Following
is a summary comparison of lease operating expenses, by region, for the periods.  

Consistent
with our business model and operating history, we experience steep declines in lease operating expenses following strategic divestitures
and anticipate lease operating expenses to ramp up to levels consistent with regional costs as new wells are brought on line.  

Depreciation
and Depletion Expense.  Depreciation and depletion expense was $25,069 and $149,717 for the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively, and $74,333 and $427,792 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The
decrease was due to impairment charges during 2015 and lower production rates.  

Impairment
of Oil and Gas Properties . During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded an impairment expense
of $0 and $677,051, respectively, associated with the decline in energy prices.  

General
and Administrative Expenses.  General and administrative expense decreased by 7% to $362,807 during the three months ended
September 30, 2016 from $390,411 during the three months ended September 30, 2015, and increased by 6% to $1,194,223 during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $1,122,987 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increases in general
and administrative expense was primarily attributable to an increase in consulting fees and stock-based compensation expense and
the reversal, during 2015, of an over accrual of legal fees that resulted in lower legal fees in 2015.  

Other
Income . Other income consisted of interest earned on cash balances, net of interest expense. Other income totaled $849 and
$6,887 of net other income during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to $5,129
and $15,574 of other income during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The changes were attributable
to lower cash balances.  

Income
Tax Expense/Benefit . We reported no income tax expense during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to income
tax expense of $363 during the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we reported
no income tax expense compared to income tax expense of $18,423 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Financial
Condition   

Liquidity
and Capital Resources.  At September 30, 2016, we had a cash balance of $872,130 and working capital of $1,129,646, compared
to a cash balance of $2,123,520 and working capital of $2,384,283 at December 31, 2015. The change in cash and working capital
during the period was primarily attributable to the operating loss for the first nine months of 2016.  

Operating
activities used cash of $1,023,200 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $1,494,704 of cash used during
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The change in operating cash flow used was primarily attributable to (1) changes in
operating assets and liabilities (reflecting settlement of litigation and insurance claims and associated legal fees, an increase
in prepaid expenses and a decrease in payables and accrued expenses) which accounted for a reduction in cash of $666,734 in 2015
versus changes in operating assets and liabilities which accounted for an increase in cash of $3,246 in 2016, partially offset
by (2) an increase in cash loss, after elimination of non-cash items, of $198,479, attributable to decreased revenues and increased
general and administrative expenses.  

Investing
activities used $92,217 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $25,029 of cash used during the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The funds used by investing activities during the 2016 nine-month period reflect the investments in
oil and gas properties, totaling $92,217. The funds used by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015
reflect the investments in oil and gas properties, totaling $141,146, partially offset by proceeds of $56,705 from the sale of
the Company s interest in several oil and gas wells and the release of $59,412 of funds held in escrow from the prior sale
of our interests in HDC LLC, HL, LLC and the Tambaqui prospect.  

Financing
activities used $135,973 for the acquisition of treasury shares during the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0
used during the 2015 period.  

Long-Term
Liabilities . At September 30, 2016, we had long-term liabilities of $25,676 as compared to $25,262 at December 31, 2015. Long-term
liabilities at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consisted of a reserve for plugging costs.  

Capital
and Exploration Expenditures and Commitments.  Our principal capital and exploration expenditures relate to ongoing efforts
to acquire, drill and complete prospects. We expect that future capital and exploration expenditures will be funded principally
through funds on hand and funds provided by capital raising efforts.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we invested $92,217 for the development of oil and gas properties, consisting of (1)
preparation and evaluation costs in Colombia of $67,966, and (2) costs on U.S. properties of $24,251. Of the amount invested,
we capitalized $24,251 to oil and gas properties subject to amortization, and $67,966 to oil and gas properties not subject to
amortization.  

With
the termination of our agreement to purchase an equity interest in Tamboran Resources, we presently have no budgeted capital expenditures
for the balance of 2016 or 2017. Capital expenditure plans for 2016 and 2017 may change should we satisfactorily resolve ongoing
uncertainty regarding operations in Colombia or in connection with a strategic transaction or based on field conditions and other
factors beyond our control or the control of the operators of our prospects and, as such, there can be no assurance as to the
timing or the amount of actual capital expenditures.  

Depending
on the timing and ultimate outcome of our strategic alternatives initiative and potential expenditures relating to our Colombian
assets, our cash on hand may not be adequate to fully fund our operations over the upcoming twelve months, including our capital
expenditure budget. Accordingly, absent substantial curtailment of operations and initiatives, we will require additional capital
to fully fund our future drilling budget and operations. If, for any reason, we are unable to fully fund our drilling budget and
fail to satisfy commitments reflected therein, we may be subject to penalties or to the possible loss of some of our rights and
interests in prospects with respect to which we fail to satisfy funding commitments. We have no commitments to provide any additional
financing should we require and seek such financing and there is no guarantee that we will be able to secure additional financing
on acceptable terms, or at all, to fully fund our drilling budget and to support future acquisitions, development activities and
operations.  

Outlook;
Strategic Alternatives   

Continued
low oil and natural gas prices during 2015 and into 2016 and lagging production in light of recurring delays in drilling of our
Colombian prospects have had a significant adverse impact on our business. Our financial statements include a  going concern 
qualification reflecting substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. While we have no debt and have taken
steps to reduce our overhead, we continue to operate at a loss and expect to continue to do so until such time as we can increase
production levels and realize substantial improvement in commodity prices. With the continuing permitting issues in Colombia and
the lack of clarity as to future operations in Colombia, our near term efforts to bolster production and profitability are focused
on opportunistic acquisitions of assets or companies in the current depressed market.  

Given
the uncertainty as to timing and ultimate outcome of our current initiatives in Colombia, management has determined that we should
consider strategic alternatives, including seeking a merger partner or acquisition of significant oil and gas assets with a view
to maximizing long-term value to our shareholders. To that end, we have retained a business development advisor to assist in identifying
and financing strategic transactions, have evaluated a substantial number of potential transactions and have submitted letters
of intent with respect to several potential acquisitions but, to date, we have not yet entered into any definitive agreements
to acquire assets. While we believe that there are attractive opportunities that will be available to execute one or more strategic
transactions that will position us to take advantage of an anticipated future recovery in energy markets, such transactions, or
the financing of the same, may be highly dilutive and there can be no assurance that any such strategic transaction can be executed
on acceptable terms or at all.  

We
do not presently have adequate financial resources to support operations at current levels for the upcoming twelve months or to
support any meaningful acquisitions or capital calls should development operations resume in Colombia. While we may curtail operations
further or seek to divest certain holdings to preserve liquidity, absent dramatic increases in energy prices or other unforeseen
events, we anticipate that we will be required to seek additional financing to support our ongoing strategic acquisition initiative
and/or a resumption of activities in Colombia. We can provide no assurance that our efforts will be sufficient to reverse the
trend of operating losses, to provide adequate financial resources to sustain operations and retention of our assets pending attainment
of profitable operations or consummate of a strategic transaction.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
had no off-balance sheet arrangements or guarantees of third party obligations at September 30, 2016.  

Inflation   

We
believe that inflation has not had a significant impact on operations since inception.  

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

Commodity
Price Risk   

The
price we receive for our oil and gas production heavily influences our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate
of growth. Crude oil and natural gas are commodities and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response
to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the markets for oil and gas have been volatile, and these markets
will likely continue to be volatile in the future. The prices we receive for production depends on numerous factors beyond our
control.  

We
have not historically entered into any hedges or other transactions designed to manage, or limit, exposure to oil and gas price
volatility.  

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Under
the supervision and the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
we conducted an evaluation as of September 30, 2016 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016. Such conclusion reflects the 2013 departure of our chief financial
officer and assumption of duties of principal financial officer by our chief executive officer and the resulting lack of segregation
of duties. Until we are able to remedy these material weaknesses, we are relying on third party consultants and our accounting
firm to assist with financial reporting.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

No
change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934)
occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.
