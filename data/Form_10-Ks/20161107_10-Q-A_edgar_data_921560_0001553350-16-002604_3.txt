We are amending the Original Filing to restate our unaudited financial statements as of March 31, 2016 for incorrect application of certain accounting practices and procedures in relation to the legal services provided to the shareholders, for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. In connection with the July 20, 2015 Securities Purchase Agreement, a legal service fee of $6,160 should be classified as the shareholders  expenses and accounted for as due from shareholders. As of March 31, 2016, salaries of $14,150 were incorrectly accrued, and furniture and equipment of $2,259 and the prepaid expenses of $3,825 were incorrectly expensed.  
   
 For the convenience of the reader, this Amended Filing sets forth the Original Filing, as modified and superseded where necessary to reflect the restatement. The following items have been amended as a result of, and to reflect, the restatement: 

1.

This Amended Filing continues to describe the conditions as of the date of the Original Filing and, except as contained herein; we have not updated or modified the disclosures contained in the Original Filing.

 Basis of Presentation 
   
 The accompanying unaudited condensed interim financial statements of Aladdin International, Inc. (the  Company  or  Aladdin ) have been prepared, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2016 and 2015 and for the periods then ended have been made. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s June 30, 2015 audited financial statements. The results of operations for these interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire year. 
   
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern. However, the Company has no business operations and recurring losses and has negative working capital and shareholders  deficits, and due to the uncertainty of the Company s ability to meet its current operating and capital expenses, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, as the continuation and expansion of its business is dependent upon obtaining further financing. The Company has financed its operations primarily through the sale of stock and advances from a related party.  There is no assurance that these advances will continue in the future.  The condensed interim financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.   
   
 The accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2015, filed on September 25, 2015 ( Annual Report ).  Interim results for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2016. 
   
 Change in Control of the Company  
   
 On July 20, 2015, Michael Friess and Sanford Schwartz (collectively, the  Shareholders ), majority shareholders of the Company, entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) with Billion Reward Development Limited ( Billion Reward ), a British Virgin Islands corporation, pursuant to which the Shareholders sold to Billion Reward  an aggregate of 3,638,748 shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share of the Company (the  Majority Interests ) for $300,000, resulting in Billion Reward owning approximately 80% of the total outstanding shares of the Company, and a change in control of the Company.  
   
 In connection with the Purchase Agreement, on July 20, 2015, Michael Friess, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company resigned from all of his officer positions with the Company except that his resignation as a member of the Board was not effective until the tenth day following the Company s mailing of the Information Statement on Schedule 14f-1 to its shareholders as of the record date of July 20, 2015. In addition, Sanford Schwartz, the Company s Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, Treasurer, and member of the Board resigned from all of his positions with the Company.  
   
 Also effective on July 20, 2015, Ningdi Chen was appointed as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Treasurer, Secretary and Director of the Board.  
   
 On October 1, 2015, Kai Ming Zhao accepted an offer letter ( Offer Letter ) from the Company to serve as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Under the Offer Letter, Mr. Zhao s total salary is $150,000 per year, with cash bonus based on performance.  
   
 On October 20, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company accepted the resignation of Mr. Ningdi Chen as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, and Treasurer of the Company.

 Also on October 20, 2015, the Board of Directors appointed Mr. Kai Ming Zhao as the Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary, and Treasurer of the Company. Mr. Kai Ming Zhao is also the principal accounting officer of the Company.  
   
 Significant Accounting Policies 
   
 Refer to the Company s Annual Report for a summary of significant accounting policies. There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies during the nine months ended March 31, 2016, other than the addition of the policies below regarding related party debt and operating leases.   
   
 (a) 
 Related Party Debt 
   
  Convertible Note  
   
  The Company occasionally obtains financing from related parties in the form of notes payable which are convertible into shares of the Company s common stock. The Company accounts for convertible notes and debt issuance costs associated with convertible notes following the guidance set forth in ASC 470-20,    Debt with Conversion and Other Options;    ASC 480,    Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity;    ASC 815-40,    Derivatives and Hedging   Contracts in Entity s Own Equity;    EITF 07-5,    Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entity s Own Stock; and    ASU 2015-03,    Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.   
   
  The terms of such convertible notes payable are analyzed by management to determine their accounting treatment, including determining whether conversion features are required to be bifurcated and treated as a discount, allocation of fair value of the issuance to the debt instrument and any beneficial conversion features, and the applicable classification of the convertible notes payable as debt, equity or mezzanine temporary equity.  
   
  The intrinsic value of the embedded conversion feature of related party convertible notes payable are included in the discount to notes payable, which is accreted to interest expense over the expected term of the note using the effective interest method. The Company s management also estimates the total fair value of any beneficial conversion feature in allocating debt proceeds. The proceeds allocated to the beneficial conversion feature are determined by taking the estimated fair value of shares issuable under the convertible notes less the fair value of the number of shares that would be issued if the conversion rate equaled the fair value of the Company s common stock as of the date of issuance.  
   
  Non-convertible Note  
   
  The Company occasionally obtains financing from related parties in the form of notes payable. The Company accounts for such notes following the guidance set forth in ASU 2015-03,    Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.   
   
 (b) 
 Concentrations 
   
 Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents.  At March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2015, the Company had no amounts of cash or cash equivalents in financial institutions in excess of amounts insured by agencies of the U.S. Government. 
   
 (c) 
 Reclassifications 
   
 Certain amounts previously reported have been reclassified to conform to current presentation. 
   
 (d) 
 Operating Leases 
   
 The Company accounts for operating leases in accordance with SFAS No. 13,   Accounting for Leases,   and Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Technical Bulletin 88   1,     Issues Relating to Accounting for Leases.     Accordingly, rent expense under operating leases for the Company   s administrative office is recognized on a straight-line basis over the original term of each lease, inclusive of predetermined rent escalations or modifications.

(2)  
  Capital Stock   
   
 Pursuant to the Articles of Incorporation of the Company, the Company is authorized to issue 780,000,000 shares of common stock with $.001 par value and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock with $.001 par value. There were 4,548,435 shares of common stock issued and outstanding on March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2015.  
   
 There were no preferred shares outstanding as of March 31, 2016.  
   
 The Company occasionally incurs expenses that are paid by related parties. When the related parties do not expect repayment these amounts are recorded as increases in additional paid-in capital. During the nine months ended March 31, 2016 related parties paid expenses totaling $1,422. Also included in additional paid in capital is $8,059 in debt discount and $4,052 of imputed interest incurred during the nine months ended March 31, 2016. 
   
  (3)  
  Related Party Transactions   
   
 Before July 20, 2015, the Company used the offices of its former President for its minimal office facility needs for no consideration. No provision for these costs has been provided since it has been determined that they are immaterial.  
   
 On October 23, 2015, the Company and Billion Reward entered into a Loan Agreement ( October Loan Agreement ), whereby Billion Reward agreed to provide a loan in the amount of $200,000 (the  October Loan ) to the Company with an original maturity date of April 30, 2016 extended to January 31, 2017 and bearing no interest. Under the October Loan Agreement, if the Company conducts an offering for a total amount of $2,000,000 (the  Offering ) on or before February 28, 2016, the October Loan will be automatically converted into shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share of the Company at the conversion price equal to the purchase price in the Offering.   
   
 In addition, pursuant to the October Loan Agreement, Billion Reward will be entitled to convert any portion or all of the October Loan into shares of Common Stock of the Company, at the conversion price of volume weighted average price of the Common Stock as reported by Bloomberg for twenty trading days prior to such conversion. The Company has estimated the intrinsic value of this embedded conversion feature and recorded it as a discount to related party convertible debt of $8,059. The Company expensed $6,755 of the discount to interest expense during the nine months ending March 31, 2016 and has a net unamortized discount of $1,304 as of March 31, 2016. 
   
 On November 5, 2015 the Company received the October Loan in the amount of $200,000; the October Loan remains outstanding as of March 31, 2016. 
   
 On January 7, 2016 the Company and Billion Reward entered into a loan agreement ( January Loan Agreement ), whereby Billion Reward agreed to provide a loan in the amount of $100,000 (the  January Loan ) to the Company with the maturity date of January 31, 2017 and bearing no interest. 
   
 On January 12, 2016 the Company received the January Loan in the amount of $100,000. 
   
  (4)  
  Commitments and Contingencies  
   
  Operating Lease  
   
 The Company entered into a non-cancelable operating sub-lease for office space on December 22, 2015 for a term that expires August 18, 2017 and paid $116,523 to the landlord of which $63,558 is a security deposit and $52,965 for five months prepaid rent of which $17,654 has been expensed as of March 31, 2016. The sub-lease commenced on February 7, 2016. Future minimum annual lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases in effect as of March 31, 2016, are as follows:

  Subsequent Events   
   
   The Company has evaluated events subsequent to March 31, 2016 and through the date the financial statements were available to be issued, to assess the need for potential recognition or disclosure in this report.  
   
 On April 22, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company decided to no longer pursue the previously disclosed contemplated business combination. 
   
 On April 30, 2016, the October 23, 2015 loan from Billion Reward matured without Billion Reward exercising the option to convert the note to shares of stock under the provisions of the Loan Agreement.  
   
 On May 5, 2016, the Company and Billion Reward amended the October Loan Agreement ( October Loan Agreement ), whereby Billion Reward agreed to make the October Loan a non-convertible loan and extend the maturity date to January 31, 2017. 
   
  (6)   
  Restatement of Previously Issued Condensed Financial Statements  
   
  The Company determined that a legal service fee, salaries, furniture and equipment, and the prepaid expenses were not properly recorded and the Company's previously issued financial statements needed to be restated. As such, the Company is restating in this Quarterly Report its financial statements for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2016.

ITEM 2.   
  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.    
     
  The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed interim financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Report.   
   
  Certain statements in this Report constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements, which involve risks and uncertainties, regarding, among other things, (a) our projected sales, profitability, and cash flows, (b) our growth strategy, (c) anticipated trends in our industry, (d) our future financing plans, and (e) our anticipated needs for, and use of, working capital. They are generally identifiable by use of the words  may,   will,   should,   anticipate,   estimate,   plan,   potential,   project,   continuing,   ongoing,   expects,   management believes,   we believe,   we intend,  or the negative of these words or other variations on these words or comparable terminology. In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements contained in this filing will in fact occur. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.   
   
  The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and, except to the extent required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.   
   
  The  Company ,  we,   us,  and  our,  refer to Aladdin International, Inc.   
   
  Overview   
   
 The Company was incorporated under the laws of the state of Minnesota on May 3, 1972. The Company was a franchisee of fast food restaurants in Milwaukee, Wisconsin until the franchised restaurants were sold in October 1998. The Company held a shareholder meeting on November 25, 2014 to reincorporate the Company in the State of Nevada through merging into Aladdin International, Inc. incorporated in Nevada and amend the Articles of Incorporation to increase the authorized capital stock of the Company to eight hundred million (800,000,000) shares. The shares of stock consist of 780,000,000 shares of common stock with full voting rights and a par value of $0.001 per share and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. The merger of the Minnesota company into the Nevada company was effective on December 23, 2014 and the Articles of Merger were filed on December 30, 2014.  
   
 On July 20, 2015, Michael Friess and Sanford Schwartz (collectively, the  Shareholders ), majority shareholders of the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) with Billion Reward Development Limited (the  Purchaser ), a British Virgin Islands corporation, pursuant to which the Shareholders sold to the Purchaser an aggregate of 3,638,748 shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share of the Company (the  Majority Interests ) for $300,000 (the  Change in Control Transaction ).  
   
 In connection with the Purchase Agreement, on July 20, 2015, Michael Friess, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, President and member of the Board of Directors (the  Board ) of the Company resigned from all of his officer positions with the Company except that his resignation as a member of the Board was not effective until the tenth day following the Company's mailing of the Information Statement on Schedule 14f-1 to its shareholders as of the record date of July 20, 2015. Sanford Schwartz, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, Treasurer, and member of the Board resigned from all of his positions with the Company. Also effective on July 20, 2015, Ningdi Chen was appointed as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Treasurer, Secretary and Director of the Board.  
   
 Since June 2010, the Company has had insignificant operations and assets consisting primarily of cash. As such, the Company is presently defined as a  shell  company under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act ). The Company has opted to become a  blank check  company and to further engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions. At this time, the Company's purpose is to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire an interest in business opportunities presented to it by persons or firms who or which desire to seek the perceived advantages of an Exchange Act registered corporation. The Company may seek a business opportunity with entities which have recently commenced operations, or which wish to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital in order to expand into new products or markets, to develop a new product or service, or for other corporate purposes. The Company may acquire assets and establish wholly-owned subsidiaries in various businesses or acquire existing businesses as subsidiaries. However, there is no guarantee that any of such merger or acquisition will be successful.  

9 

The Company is planning to acquire a private company for a business combination and has had informal discussions with potential acquisition targets.  Previously disclosed informal discussions regarding a potential acquisition of a company in the business of creating and monetizing products based on licensed film and television intellectual property have ceased. No definitive documentation has been entered into in connection with any acquisition and there can be no assurance that the Company will successfully make any acquisition. If an acquisition occurs, the Company would likely issue a substantial number of additional shares of its common stock at a price which could be substantially below the current trading price of the Company s common stock. There may be no independent valuation done of any proposed target and there can be no assurance that the value of any proposed target would approximate the value of securities of the Company to be issued in connection with such acquisition.

 On October 23, 2015, the Company and Billion Reward Development Limited ( Billion Reward ), our majority shareholder which owns 80% of total issued and outstanding shares of the common stock of the Company, entered into a Loan Agreement ( October Loan Agreement ), whereby Billion Reward agrees to provide a loan in the amount of $200,000 (the  October Loan ) to the Company with an original maturity date of April 30, 2016 extended to January 31, 2017 and bearing no interest. Under the October Loan Agreement, if the Company conducts an offering for a total amount of $2,000,000 (the  Offering ) on or before February 28, 2016, the Loan will be automatically converted into shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share ( Common Stock ) of the Company at the conversion price equal to the purchase price in the Offering. Pursuant to the October Loan Agreement, Billion Reward will be entitled to convert any portion or all of the October Loan into shares of Common Stock of the Company, at the conversion price of volume weighted average price of the Common Stock as reported by Bloomberg for twenty trading days prior to such conversion. On November 5, 2015, the Company received the October Loan in the amount of $200,000; the October Loan remains outstanding as of March 31, 2016. 
   
 On January 7, 2016 the Company and Billion Reward entered into a loan agreement ( January Loan Agreement ), whereby Billion Reward agreed to provide a loan in the amount of $100,000 (the  January Loan ) to the Company with the maturity date of January 31, 2017 and bearing no interest. On January 12, 2016 the Company received the January Loan in the amount of $100,000. 
   
 As of March 31, 2016, our accumulated deficit was ($512,549). Our stockholders' deficit as of March 31, 2016 was ($211,956). Our net loss for the three months and nine months ended March 31, 2016 were ($119,700) and ($226,294), respectively. Our losses have principally been attributed to a lack of revenues while incurring operating expenses.  
   
 The following table provides selected condensed interim financial data about our company for the periods ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 and the year ended June 30, 2015. For detailed financial information, see the condensed interim financial statements included elsewhere herein.

Results of Operations   
   
  For the three and nine months ended March 31, 2016 compared to the three and nine months ended March 31, 2015   
   
 The following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed interim financial statements included herein. Our unaudited operating results for the periods ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 are summarized as follows:  

Revenues   
   
 We did not earn any revenues for the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2016. We are presently in the development stage of our business and we can provide no assurance that we will begin earning revenues. 
   
  Operating Expenses   
   
 Our operating expenses for the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 (unaudited) are outlined in the table below: 

Operating expenses are comprised of audit, professional fees, payroll, rent and other general and administrative expenses. Operating expenses increased by $104,821 or 1,214.1%, from $8,634 during the three months ended March 31, 2015 to $113,455 during the three months ended March 31, 2016.  Also, operating expenses increased by $184,116, or 586.8%, from $31,376 during the nine months ended March 31, 2015 to $215,492 during the nine months ended March 31, 2016.  These increases are primarily due to payroll expenses associated with a new executive officer and assistant hired in fiscal 2016, rent for office space and legal services associated with potential debt and equity financings and potential business combination.  
   
  Net Loss   
   
 The net losses for the three month periods ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 were ($120,050), and ($8,634), respectively, and for the nine month periods ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 were ($226,294) and ($31,376), respectively. The increased net losses are primarily due to increased operating expenses as discussed above.  

11 

Cash Flow  
   
 Our cash flows for the nine month periods ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 (unaudited) are outlined in the table below: 

Total cash flows increased by $1,886, or 468% from $403 for the nine months ended March 31, 2015 to $2,289 for the nine months ended March 31, 2016. The increase was due to an increase in cash flows from financing activities offsetting a decrease in cash flows from operating activities.  
   
 Cash flows from operating activities were mainly comprised of the operating loss and increase in pre-paid expenses and security deposits offset by the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. These cash flows decreased by $261,803, or 905.6% from ($28,911) for the nine months ended March 31, 2015 to ($290,714) for the nine months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease was due to increases in the operating loss of $194,918 or 586.8%, as discussed above, and prepaid expenses and deposits of $102,694, or 58,682.3%, being partially offset by increased accrued liabilities of $24,935, or 1,088.9%, from $2,290 to $27,225 for the nine months ended March 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively. The changes in prepaid expenses, deposits and accrued liabilities mainly resulted from prepaid legal fees and the operating lease of office space (refer to Note 4).  
   
 Financing cash flows increased by $265,948, or 907.2%, from $29,314 for the nine months ended March 31, 2015 to $295,262 for the nine months ended March 31, 2016. These changes were primarily the result of the $200,000 related party convertible note, the $93,840 related party loan (refer to Note 3), $17,892 decreased additional paid-in capital, and $10,000 decrease in issuance of stocks. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources    
   
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern.  
   
 It is the intent of management to provide the working capital necessary to support and preserve the integrity of the Company but there is no legal obligation for management to provide any additional funding to the Company. It is anticipated that the Company will require approximately $200,000 during the next 12 months to implement its business plan. As of March 31, 2016, the Company has limited capital with which to pay anticipated expenses. 

12 

In view of these matters, realization of certain of the assets in the accompanying balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which in turn is dependent upon the Company's ability to meet its financial requirements, raise additional capital, and the success of its future operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relative to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be able to continue as a going concern. The Company has financed its operations primarily through the sale of stock and advances from a related party. There is no assurance there will be future sales of stock or that these advances will continue in the future. 
   
 As of March 31, 2016, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
   
  Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, ( U.S. GAAP ), on the basis that the Company will continue as a going concern.   Due to the uncertainty of the Company s ability to meet its current operating and capital expenses, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, as the continuation and expansion of our business is dependent upon obtaining further financing. Our condensed interim financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.   
   
  The preparation of these condensed interim financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments, including those described below. We base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the present circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.  
   
  While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K   for the year ended June 30, 2015, filed on September 25, 2015 ( Annual Report )  , we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to assist you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements.  
   
  (a)  
  Related Party Debt  
   
   Convertible Notes      
   
  Occasionally, we obtain financing from related parties in the form of notes payable convertible into shares of our common stock. We analyze the terms of such convertible notes payable to determine their accounting treatment, including determining whether conversion features are required to be bifurcated and treated as a discount, allocation of fair value of the issuance to the debt instrument and any beneficial conversion features, and the applicable classification of the convertible notes payable and warrants as debt, equity or mezzanine temporary equity.  
   
  We include the intrinsic value of the embedded conversion feature of convertible notes payable in the discount to notes payable, which is accreted to interest expense over the expected term of the note using the effective interest method.  We also estimate the total fair value of any beneficial conversion feature in allocating debt proceeds. The proceeds allocated to the beneficial conversion feature are determined by taking the estimated fair value of shares issuable under the convertible notes less the fair value of the number of shares that would be issued if the conversion rate equaled the fair value of our common stock as of the date of issuance.  
   
  Convertible notes to related parties are separately identified in our financial statements.   
   
  Non-convertible Notes  
   
  The Company occasionally obtains financing from related parties in the form of notes payable and are identified in our financial statements.  
   
  We also disclose significant terms of all transactions with related parties.  

13 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   
   
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.  
   
    ITEM 3.   
  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.    
   
 Pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K (  229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a  smaller reporting company,  as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1).   
     
  ITEM 4.   
  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.    
   
  Disclosures Control and Procedures   
   
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:  

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and  

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  
   
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. 
   
 As of March 31, 2016, our CEO evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Disclosure controls and procedure include, without limitations, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Management is responsible for monitoring the process pursuant to which information is gathered and analyze such information to determine the extent to which such information requires disclosure in the reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based on such evaluation, our CEO has concluded that as of March 31, 2016, the disclosure controls and procedure of the Company were effective.  
   
 As of March 31, 2016, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission s 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.  

14 

The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (3) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive Officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of March 31, 2016.  
   
 Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (1), (2) and (3) above did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods.  
   
  Management s Remediation Initiatives   
   
 In an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated, or plan to initiate, the following series of measures:  
   
 We will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to us. And, we plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available to us.  
   
 Management believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors, who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee, will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board.  
   
 We anticipate that these initiatives will be at least partially, if not fully, implemented by the end of fiscal year 2016. Additionally, we plan to test our updated controls and remediate our deficiencies in year 2016.  
   
  Changes in internal controls over financial reporting   
   
  Except the above, there was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Report, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
