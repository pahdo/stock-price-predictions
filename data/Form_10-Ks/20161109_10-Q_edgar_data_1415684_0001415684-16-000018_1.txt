NOTE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Except
as otherwise indicated herein, the terms  Company,   we,   our  and  us  refer
to MusclePharm Corporation and its subsidiaries. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within
the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position,
our business strategy and plans, and our objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The words  believe, 
 may,   will,   estimate,   continue,   anticipate,   intend, 
 expect,  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking
statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial
condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial
needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those described
in Item 1A,  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the  SEC ) on March 17, 2016, as amended on April 29, 2016. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly
changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we
assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual
results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties
and assumptions, the future events and trends discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may not occur and actual results
could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements.   

We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release
the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Given these risks and uncertainties,
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.

  Note 1. Description of Business  

Description of Business   

MusclePharm Corporation,
or the Company, was incorporated in Nevada in 2006.      Except
as otherwise indicated herein, the terms  Company,   we,   our  and  us  refer
to MusclePharm Corporation and its subsidiaries. The Company is a scientifically driven, performance lifestyle company that develops,
manufactures, markets and distributes branded nutritional supplements. The Company is headquartered in Denver, Colorado and,
as of September 30, 2016, had the following wholly-owned operating subsidiaries: MusclePharm Canada Enterprises Corp ( MusclePharm
Canada ), MusclePharm Ireland Limited ( MusclePharm Ireland ) and MusclePharm Australia Pty Limited ( MusclePharm
Australia ). A former subsidiary of the Company, BioZone Laboratories, Inc. ( BioZone ), was sold on May 9, 2016.  

On August 24, 2015, the Company s Board of Directors
(the  Board ) approved a restructuring plan for the Company. The approved restructuring plan was designed to reduce
costs and to better align the Company s resources for profitable growth. Specifically, through September 30, 2016, the
restructuring plan resulted in: 1) reducing the Company s workforce; 2) abandoning certain leased facilities; 3) renegotiating
or terminating a number of contracts with endorsers in a strategic shift away from such arrangements and toward more cost effective
marketing and advertising efforts; 4) discontinuing a number of stock keeping units ( SKUs ) and writing down inventory
to net realizable value, or to zero in cases where the product was discontinued; and 5) writing off certain assets. Management
has substantially completed the approved restructuring plan, and as such, we do not anticipate any additional restructuring charges. See
Note 4 for further detail. 

Management s Plans with Respect to Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

The Company s management believes the restructuring
plan implemented during August 2015, the reduction in ongoing operating costs and expense controls and the sale of BioZone, as
further described in Note 6, may enable the Company ultimately to be profitable. However, the Company may need to continue to raise
capital. There can be no assurance that such capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had an accumulated
deficit of $159.8 million and recurring losses from operations. The Company may incur additional losses until such time it can
generate significant revenues and/or reduce operating costs. In September 2014, the Company borrowed $8.0 million under a
line of credit with a bank. In February 2015, the Company entered into a term loan agreement with the same bank and borrowed
$4.0 million. In December 2015, the Company received $6.0 million upon the issuance of a convertible note with a related party
and subsequently repaid all borrowings. In January 2016, the Company entered into a secured borrowing arrangement, pursuant to
which the Company has the ability to borrow up to $10.0 million subject to sufficient amounts of accounts receivable to secure
the loan. Under this arrangement, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received $39.5 million in cash and
subsequently repaid $40.0 million, including fees and interest, on or prior to September 30, 2016. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately
$5.9 million in cash and $21.0 million in working capital deficit. 

The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
as of, and for, the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were prepared on the basis of a going concern, which contemplates,
among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly,
they do not give effect to adjustments that would be necessary should the Company be required to liquidate its assets. The
Company has not established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover its operating costs for at least the next 12 months
in order to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to meet its total liabilities of $54.8 million as of September
30, 2016, and to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until
it becomes profitable. The Company can give no assurances that any additional capital that it is able to obtain, if any, will be
sufficient to meet its needs, or that any such financing will be obtainable on acceptable terms. If the Company is unable to obtain
adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations or substantially curtail its commercial activities. These conditions raise
substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts
and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation   

The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ). The Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of MusclePharm Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Unaudited Interim Financial Information   

The accompanying unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation
S-X for interim financial information. Accordingly, these statements do not include all of the information and notes required by
GAAP for complete financial statements. The Company s management believes the unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for the fair presentation of the Company s financial
position as of September 30, 2016, results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The results of operations for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December
31, 2016. 

These unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 17, 2016. 

Use of Estimates   

The preparation of consolidated financial statements
in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in
the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, allowance for doubtful
accounts, revenue discounts and allowances, the valuation of inventory and tax assets, the assessment of useful lives, recoverability
and valuation of long-lived assets, likelihood and range of possible losses on contingencies, restructuring liabilities, valuations
of equity securities and intangible assets, fair value of derivatives, warrants and options, among others. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. 

Revenue Recognition   

 Revenue is recognized when
all of the following criteria are met: 

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists.  Evidence of an arrangement consists of an order from the Company s
distributors, resellers or customers.   

Delivery has occurred.  Delivery is deemed to have occurred when title and risk of loss has transferred, either
upon shipment of products to customers or upon delivery.   

The fee is fixed or determinable.  The Company assesses whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the terms
associated with the transaction.   

Collection is reasonably assured.  The Company assesses collectability based on credit analysis and payment history.   

 The Company s standard
terms and conditions of sale allow for product returns or replacements in certain cases. Estimates of expected future product returns
are recognized at the time of sale based on analyses of historical return trends by customer type. Upon recognition, the Company
reduces revenue and cost of revenue for the estimated return. Return rates can fluctuate over time, but are sufficiently predictable
with established customers to allow the Company to estimate expected future product returns, and an accrual is recorded for future
expected returns when the related revenue is recognized. Product returns incurred from established customers were insignificant
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Table of Contents  

The Company offers sales incentives
through various programs, consisting primarily of advertising related credits, volume incentive rebates and sales incentive reserves.
The Company records advertising related credits with customers as a reduction to revenue as no identifiable benefit is received
in exchange for credits claimed by the customer. Volume incentive rebates are provided to certain customers based on contractually
agreed upon percentages once certain thresholds have been met. Sales incentive reserves are computed based on historical trending
and budgeted discount percentages, which are typically based on historical discount rates with adjustments for any known changes,
such as future promotions or one-time historical promotions that will not repeat for each customer. The Company records sales incentive
reserves and volume rebate reserves as a reduction to revenue. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company recorded discounts, and to a lesser degree, sales returns, totaling $10.8 million and $27.9 million, respectively,
which accounted for 26% and 21% of gross revenue in each period, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015, the Company recorded discounts, and to a lesser degree, sales returns, totaling $5.9 million and $19.9 million, respectively,
which accounted for 15% and 14% of gross revenue in each period, respectively. 

Stock-Based Compensation   

The Company estimates the fair value of employee stock
options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The determination of the fair value of each stock award
using this option-pricing model is affected by the Company s assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables.
These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and the expected
term of the awards based on an analysis of the actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors and the contractual
term of the awards. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period, which is generally
consistent with the vesting of the awards, based on the estimated fair value of all stock-based payments issued to employees and
directors that are expected to vest. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

During August 2016, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash
Receipts and Cash Payments , which addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity
in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The standard
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption
is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of this
new pronouncement on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
( ASU ) No. 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting
Revenue Gross versus Net)  ( ASU 2016-08 ) which clarified the revenue recognition implementation guidance on principal
versus agent considerations and is effective during the same period as ASU 2014-09. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  ( ASU 2016-10 )
which clarified the revenue recognition guidance regarding the identification of performance obligations and the licensing implementation
and is effective during the same period as ASU 2014-09. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts
with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  ( ASU 2016-12 ) which narrowly amended
the revenue recognition guidance regarding collectability, noncash consideration, presentation of sales tax and transition. ASU
2016-12 is effective during the same period as ASU 2014-09. The Company is still evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-08,
ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12. 

Table of Contents  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation
  Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  ( ASU 2016-09 ). The standard identifies areas for simplification involving
several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards
as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as
they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-09. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases
(Topic 842) , which supersedes Topic 840,  Leases  ( ASU 2016-02 ). The guidance in this new standard requires
lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to the
current accounting and eliminates the current real estate-specific provisions for all entities. The guidance also modifies the
classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases for lessors. ASU 2016-02 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Inventory
(Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  ( ASU 2015-11 ), which simplifies the subsequent measurement
of inventory by requiring inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated
selling price of inventory in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.
ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2015-11. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Presentation
of Financial Statements  Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)  ( ASU 2014-15 ). The standard provides guidance
about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue
as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures and was issued to reduce diversity in the timing and content of
disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The
Company adopted ASU 2014-15 as of December 31, 2015. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue
from Contracts with Customers  ( ASU 2014-09 ), which provides guidance for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 affects
any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer
of nonfinancial assets and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition , and most industry-specific
guidance. This ASU also supersedes some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35,  Revenue Recognition- Construction-Type and
Production-Type Contracts . ASU 2014-09 s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised
goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange
for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under today s
guidance, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include
in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. In August 2015, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  ( ASU
2015-14 ), which delays the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. The FASB also agreed to allow entities to choose to
adopt the standard as of the original effective date. As such, the updated standard will be effective for the Company in the first
quarter of 2018, with the option to adopt it in the first quarter of 2017. The Company may adopt the new standard under the full
retrospective approach or the modified retrospective approach. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has determined
the effect of ASU 2014-09 on its ongoing financial reporting. 

Note 3. Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

Management believes the fair value of the obligation
under secured borrowing arrangement and convertible note with a related party approximates carrying value because the debt carries
market rates of interest, and are both short-term in nature. The Company s remaining financial instruments consisted primarily
of accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and accrued restructuring charges, all of which are short-term in
nature with fair values approximating carrying value.

Note 4. Restructuring  

As part of an effort to better focus and align the Company s
resources toward profitable growth, on August 24, 2015, the Board authorized the Company to undertake steps to commence a
restructuring of the business and operations, which concluded during the current quarter. The Company closed certain facilities,
reduced headcount, discontinued products, and renegotiated certain contracts resulting in restructuring and other charges of $21.2 million
in 2015, of which $2.9 million was included in  Cost of revenue  and $18.3 million was included in operating
expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the Company recorded restructuring charges in  Cost of revenue  of $0.1 million and $2.3 million, respectively, related
to the write-down of inventory identified to be discontinued in the restructuring plan. For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015, such write-down for discontinued inventory recorded in  Cost of revenue  was $1.3 million, respectively. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
recorded restructuring charges of $1.7 million. During the period, the Company closed its accounting and administration office
in Denver, Colorado and its distribution center in Pittsburg, California. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
recorded a credit in  Restructuring and other charges  of $2.6 million comprised of: (i) an expense credit of
$4.8 million related to the release of a restructuring accrual of $7.0 million, offset by the cash payment of $2.2 million related
to the settlement agreement which terminated all future commitments between ETW Corporation ( ETW ) and the Company
(see Note 14); (ii) $1.3 million related to write-off of long-lived assets related to the abandonment of certain lease facilities;
and (iii) $0.9 million related to severance and other employee compensation costs. With the restructuring plan substantially complete,
the Company does not anticipate incurring any additional restructuring charges for the remainder of 2016. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company
recorded expense of $16.7 million in  Restructuring and other charges  comprised of: (i) $9.3 million related to severance
and other employee compensation costs; (ii) $6.6 million related to cancellation of certain contracts and sponsorship agreements;
and (iii) $0.8 million for costs associated with permanently vacating certain leased facilities. 

As of September 30, 2016, the restructuring charges to
be paid in cash totaled $2.5 million. 

The following table illustrates the provision of the
restructuring charges and the accrued restructuring charges balance as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (in thousands):

Note 5. Capstone Nutrition Agreements  

The Company entered into a series of agreements with
Capstone Nutrition ( Capstone ) effective March 2, 2015, including an amendment (the  Amendment )
to a Manufacturing Agreement dated November 27, 2013 (as amended, the  Manufacturing Agreement ). Pursuant to
the Amendment, Capstone shall be the Company s nonexclusive manufacturer of dietary supplements and food products sold or
intended to be sold by the Company. The Amendment includes various agreements including amended pricing terms. The initial term
per this Amendment was to end on January 1, 2022, and could have been extended for three successive 24-month terms, and includes
renewal options. 

The Company agreed to pay to Capstone a non-refundable
sum of $2.5 million to be used by Capstone solely in connection with the expansion of its facility necessary to fulfill anticipated
Company requirements under the Manufacturing Agreement and Amendment. The Company paid Capstone this $2.5 million during 2015. 

The Company and Capstone entered into a Class B Common
Stock Warrant Purchase Agreement ( Warrant Agreement ) whereby the Company could purchase approximately 19.9% of Capstone s
parent company, INI Parent, Inc. ( INI ), on a fully-diluted basis as of March 2, 2015. Pursuant to the Warrant
Agreement, INI issued to the Company a warrant (the  Warrant ) to purchase shares of INI s Class B common stock,
par value $0.001 per share, at an exercise price of $0.01 per share (the  Warrant Shares ). The Warrant could have
been exercised if the Company was in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Amendment. 

The Company utilized the Black-Scholes valuation model
to determine the value of the Warrant and recorded an asset of $977,000, which was accounted for under the cost method and assessed
for impairment. The Warrant was included in long-term investments on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31,
2015. However, during the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company reassessed the value of the Warrant and considered it to
be fully impaired as the Company no longer believes there is any remaining value to the Warrant. The Company also had recorded
$1.5 million of prepaid expenses and other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015, which
were being amortized over the remaining life of the Manufacturing Agreement of 6.5 years. However, during the three months
ended June 30, 2016, the Company reassessed the Manufacturing Agreement, which was the basis of the prepaid asset, and considered
the entire remaining balance of $1.4 million impaired as the Company no longer believes there is any remaining value to the Manufacturing
Agreement. These conclusions were based in large part on the fact that Capstone sold its primary powder manufacturing facility
during the quarter ended June 30, 2016, which significantly reduced its manufacturing capacity, and the ongoing dispute which is
discussed below. 

In total, the Company recognized $2.4 million of impairment
expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 related to previously recorded Capstone-related assets. 

The Company and INI also entered into an option agreement
(the  Option Agreement ). Subject to additional provisions and conditions set forth in the Option Agreement, at any
time on or prior to June 30, 2016, the Company had the right to purchase for cash all of the remaining outstanding shares
of INI s common stock not already owned by the Company after giving effect to the exercise of the Warrant, based on an aggregate
enterprise value, equal to $200.0 million. The fair value of the option was deemed de minimis as of the transaction date.
The Company did not exercise the option to purchase the remaining outstanding shares of INI s common stock and such option
expired on June 30, 2016. 

Table of Contents  

The Company is engaged in a dispute with Capstone arising
out of a Manufacturing Agreement between the parties. Capstone claims $65.0 million in damages, including approximately $22.0 million
it claims the Company owes pursuant to the Manufacturing Agreement, of which $21.9 million was included in the Company s
accounts payable and accrued liabilities balances as of September 30, 2016. The Company claims that Capstone owes the Company at
least $13.5 million for losses caused by, among other things, Capstone s failure to timely manufacture and supply the Company s
products. On February 12, 2016, Capstone commenced a mediation with the American Arbitration Association. Subsequent to September 30, 2016, the parties entered into a settlement agreement. See Note 18. 

Note 6. Sale of BioZone  

In May 2016, the Company completed the sale of its wholly-owned
subsidiary, BioZone, for gross proceeds of $9.8 million, including cash of $5.9 million, a $2.0 million credit for future inventory
deliveries reflected as a prepaid asset in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and $1.5 million which is subject to an earn-out
based on the financial performance of BioZone for the twelve months following the closing of the transaction. In addition, the
Company agreed to pay down $350,000 of BioZone s accounts payables, which was deducted from the purchase price. As part of
the transaction, the Company also agreed to transfer to the buyer 200,000 shares of its common stock with a market value on the
date of issuance of $640,000, for consideration of $50,000. The Company recorded a loss of $2.1 million related to the sale of
BioZone. The loss on the sale of BioZone primarily related to the subsidiary s pre-tax losses for 2016. Pre-tax loss for
BioZone for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1.5 million. 

Upon closing of the sale of BioZone, the Company entered
into a manufacturing and supply agreement whereby the Company is required to purchase a minimum of $3.0 million of products from
BioZone annually for an initial term of three years. The sale of BioZone did not qualify as discontinued operations as the disposal
of BioZone did not represent a strategic shift that had (or will have) a major effect on the Company s operations and financial
results. 

The following table summarizes the components of the
loss from the sale of BioZone (in thousands): 

In connection with the sale of BioZone, the Company and
BioZone entered into a transition services agreement to provide administrative support which concluded in August 2016, and a sub-lease
to the buyer for certain premises. The Company also entered into a product development and supply agreement with Flavor Producers,
Inc. ( FPI ), the parent company of the buyer, to develop certain products to be sold by the Company. If the product
development effort is successful, the minimum purchase commitment under the product development and supply agreement with FPI is
$3.0 million over the term of 12 months. Pursuant to the agreement, product pricing is fixed for one year, and was negotiated as
an arms-length transaction. As of September 30, 2016, the product development effort had not yet commenced.

Note 7. Balance Sheet Components  

Inventory   

Inventory consisted of the following as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (in thousands): 

The Company records charges for obsolete and slow moving
inventory based on the age of the product as determined by the expiration date. Products within one year of their expiration dates
are considered for write-off purposes. Historically, the Company has had minimal returns with established customers. Other than
write-off of inventory during restructuring activities, the Company incurred insignificant inventory write-offs during the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Inventory write-downs, once established, are not reversed as they establish
a new cost basis for the inventory. 

As disclosed further in Note 4, the Company executed
a restructuring plan in August 2015 and wrote off inventory related to discontinued products. For the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, discontinued inventory of $0.1 million and $2.3 million, respectively, was written off and included as
a component of  Cost of revenue  in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2015, discontinued inventory of $1.3 million, respectively, was written off and included as
a component of  Cost of revenue  in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

In May 2016, the Company completed the sale of BioZone,
which resulted in a reduction of inventory of $1.8 million. See additional information in Note 6. Additionally, $0.4 million of
inventory related to the Arnold Schwarzenegger product line was considered impaired, and included as a component of the  Impairment
of assets  in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

million and $1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which is included in  Selling,
general, and administrative  expense in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

Table of Contents

Note 9. Debt  

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
the Company s debt consisted of the following (in thousands): 

In September 2014, the Company entered into a line
of credit facility with ANB Bank for up to $8.0 million of borrowings. The line of credit originally matured in September 2017,
and accrued interest at the prime rate plus 2%. The line of credit was secured by inventory, accounts receivable, intangible assets
and equipment. As of December 31, 2015, the outstanding borrowings under the line of credit were $3.0 million. The Company
was not in compliance with certain financial covenants under the line of credit as of December 31, 2015, which limited further
borrowings. The Company repaid its outstanding principal and accrued interest under the line of credit in full in January 2016
in conjunction with the Company s secured borrowing arrangement as described below. This line is no longer available to the
Company. 

In February 2015, the Company entered into a $4.0
million term loan agreement with ANB Bank. The term loan carried a fixed interest rate of 5.25% per annum, was repayable in
36 equal monthly installments of principal and interest, and originally matured in February 2018. The term loan contained
various events of default, including cross default provisions related to the line of credit, which could have required repayments
of the term loan. The Company was not in compliance with certain financial covenants under the term loan as of December 31,
2015, and received various waivers from the lender during the year ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015,
the outstanding borrowings under the term loan were $2.9 million. The Company repaid its outstanding principal and accrued interest
under the term loan in full in January 2016 to retire the term loan in conjunction with the Company s secured borrowing arrangement
as described below. 

In October 2015, the Company entered into loan modification
agreements with ANB Bank under the line of credit and term loan to: (i) change the maturity date of the loans to January 15,
2016, (ii) prohibit the loans to be declared in default prior to December 10, 2015, except for defaults resulting from failure
to make timely payments, and (iii) delete certain financial covenants from the line of credit. In consideration for these modifications,
Ryan Drexler, Interim Chief Executive Officer, Interim President and Chairman of the Board, and a family member provided their
individual guaranty for the remaining balance of the term loan and line of credit of $6.2 million. In consideration for executing
his guaranty, the Company issued to Mr. Drexler 28,571 shares of the Company s common stock with a grant date fair value
of $80,000 (based upon the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of issuance). 

Table of Contents  

In December 2015, the Company entered into a convertible
secured promissory note agreement with Mr. Drexler, pursuant to which he loaned the Company $6.0 million. Proceeds from
the note were used to fund working capital requirements. The convertible note is secured by all assets and properties of the Company
and its subsidiaries whether tangible or intangible. The convertible note carries an interest at a rate of 8% per annum, or 10%
in the event of default. Both the principal and the interest under the convertible note are due in January 2017, unless converted
earlier. The holder can convert the outstanding principal and accrued interest into shares of common stock (2,608,695 shares) for
$2.30 per share at any time. The Company may prepay the convertible note at the aggregate principal amount therein plus accrued
interest by giving the holder between 15 and 60 day-notice, depending upon the specific circumstances, provided that the holder
may convert the note during the notice period. The Company recorded the convertible note of $6.0 million as a liability in the
balance sheet and also recorded a beneficial conversion feature of $52,000 as a debt discount upon issuance of the convertible
note, which is being amortized over the term of the convertible debt using the effective interest method. The beneficial conversion
feature was calculated based on the difference between the fair value of common stock and the effective conversion price of the
convertible note. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the convertible note had an outstanding principal balance
of $6.0 million. 

In January 2016, the Company entered into a Purchase
and Sale Agreement (the  Agreement ) with Prestige Capital Corporation ( Prestige ) pursuant to which the
Company agreed to sell and assign and Prestige agreed to buy and accept, certain accounts receivable owed to the Company ( Accounts ).
Under the terms of the Agreement, upon the receipt and acceptance of each assignment of Accounts, Prestige will pay the Company
80% of the net face amount of the assigned Accounts, up to a maximum total borrowings of $10.0 million subject to sufficient
amounts of accounts receivable to secure the loan. The remaining 20% will be paid to the Company upon collection of the assigned
Accounts, less any chargeback, disputes, or other amounts due to Prestige. Prestige s purchase of the assigned Accounts from
the Company will be at a discount fee which varies based on the number of days outstanding from the assignment of Accounts to collection
of the assigned Accounts. In addition, the Company granted Prestige a continuing security interest in and lien upon all accounts
receivable, inventory, fixed assets, general intangibles and other assets. The Agreement s initial term of six months has
been extended by the Company to March 31, 2017. Prestige may cancel the Agreement with 30-day notice. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the
Company had no new transactions with Prestige. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company sold to Prestige accounts
with an aggregate face amount of approximately $49.3 million, for which Prestige paid to the Company approximately $39.5 million
in cash. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, $8.7 million and $40.0 million was subsequently repaid
to Prestige, including fees and interest. The proceeds from the initial assignment to Prestige under this secured borrowing arrangement
were primarily utilized to pay off the balance of the existing line of credit and term loan with ANB Bank. 

Other   

Other debt primarily consists of debt in default, which
was immaterial, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and is included as a component of short-term debt. Debt in
default is related to convertible debt issued during the year ended December 31, 2012 and prior where the convertible debt
was never converted to common stock, nor was the principal repaid. The Company is in the process of contacting the remaining debt
holder and negotiating settlement of the debt.

Table of Contents  

As described in Note 6, the Company entered into a product
development and supply agreement with FPI, the parent company of the buyer of BioZone, to develop certain products to be sold by
the Company. If the product development effort is successful, the minimum purchase commitment under the product development and
supply agreement with FPI is $3.0 million over the term of 12 months. As of September 30, 2016, the product development effort
had not yet commenced. 

Contingencies   

In the normal course of business or otherwise, the Company
may become involved in legal proceedings. The Company will accrue a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability
has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable
amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the
minimum amount in the range is accrued. The accrual for a litigation loss contingency might include, for example, estimates of
potential damages, outside legal fees and other directly related costs expected to be incurred. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the Company was involved in the following material legal proceedings described below. 

Third-Party Manufacturer Dispute   

As of September 30, 2016, the Company was engaged
in a dispute with Capstone concerning amounts allegedly owed under the Manufacturing Agreement. See Note 5 and Note 18 for
further details. 

Supplier Complaint   

In January 2016, ThermoLife International LLC ( ThermoLife ),
a supplier of nitrates to MusclePharm, filed a complaint against the Company in Arizona state court. In its complaint, ThermoLife
alleges that the Company failed to meet minimum purchase requirements contained in the parties  supply agreement. In March
2016, the Company filed an answer to ThermoLife s complaint, denying the allegations contained in the complaint, and filed
a counterclaim alleging that ThermoLife breached its express warranty to MusclePharm because ThermoLife s products were defective
and could not be incorporated into the Company s products. Therefore, the Company believes that ThermoLife s complaint
is without merit. 

Former Executive Lawsuit   

In December 2015, the Company accepted notice by Mr. Richard
Estalella ( Estalella ) to terminate his employment as the Company s President. Although Estalella sought
to terminate his employment with the Company for  Good Reason,  as defined in Estalella s employment agreement
with the Company (the  Employment Agreement ), the Company advised Estalella that it deemed his resignation to be without
Good Reason. 

In February 2016, Estalella filed a complaint in
Colorado state court against the Company and Ryan Drexler, Interim Chief Executive Officer, Interim President and Chairman of
the Board, alleging, among other things, that the Company breached the Employment Agreement, and seeking certain equitable
relief and unspecified damages. The Company believes Estalella s claims are without merit. At the Company s 2016
Annual Meeting of Stockholders in June 2016, Estalella was not reelected to the Board and is no longer a member of the Board.
As of the date of this report, the Company has evaluated the potential outcome of this lawsuit and recorded the liability
consistent with its policy. 

Shareholder Derivative Complaint   

In October 2015, Brian D. Gartner, derivatively and on
behalf of MusclePharm Corporation, filed a verified shareholder derivative complaint in the 8th District Court, State of Nevada,
Clark County (No. A-15-726810-B) alleging, among other things, breaches of fiduciary duty as members of the Board and/or executive

J. Doron, Cory Gregory, L. Gary Davis, James J. Greenwell, John H. Bluher and Daniel J. McClory. Mr. Gartner alleges a series
of accounting and disclosure failures resulted in the filing of materially false and misleading filings with the SEC from 2010
through July 2014, resulting in settlement with the SEC requiring payment of $700,000 of civil penalties. Mr. Gartner seeks various
remedies, including interpretation of bylaws provisions, permanent injunctive relief, damages against the defendants for breaches
of their fiduciary duty, corporate governance changes to ensure the Company maintains proper internal controls and SEC reporting
procedures, as well as costs and reasonable attorneys  fees, accountants  and experts  fees, costs and expenses.
The individual defendants sought removal of the action to federal court, which was granted. The plaintiff moved to remand the case
back to state court, and the parties await decision on that motion.

Insurance Carrier Lawsuit   

The Company is engaged in litigation with insurance carrier
Liberty Insurance Underwriters, Inc. arising out of Liberty s denial of coverage. In 2014, the Company sought coverage under
an insurance policy with Liberty for claims against directors and officers of the Company arising out of an investigation
by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Liberty denied coverage, and, on February 12, 2015, the Company filed a complaint in
the District Court, City and County of Denver, Colorado against Liberty claiming wrongful and unreasonable denial of coverage for
the cost and expenses incurred in connection with the SEC investigation and related matters. Liberty removed the complaint to the

The Company has filed a motion for reconsideration that has not yet been decided. 

Arnold Schwarzenegger   

The Company is engaged in a dispute with Arnold
Schwarzenegger, Marine MP, LLC,   Fitness Publications, Inc. ( AS Parties ) concerning amounts allegedly owed
under the parties  Endorsement Licensing and Co-Branding Agreement. In May 2016, the contract was terminated, and the

Note 13. Net Loss per Share  

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net
loss for the period by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. There was no dilutive
effect for the outstanding potentially dilutive securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
as the Company reported a net loss for all periods. 

The following table sets forth the computation of the
Company s basic and diluted net loss per share for the periods presented (in thousands, except share and per share data): 

Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing
net income for the period by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive
securities outstanding during each period. The Company uses the treasury stock method to determine whether there is a dilutive
effect of outstanding potentially dilutive securities, and the if-converted method to assess the dilutive effect of the convertible
note. 

There was no dilutive effect for the outstanding awards
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as the Company reported a net loss for all periods.
However, if the Company had net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the potentially dilutive securities
included in the earnings per share computation would have been 2,608,695 for both periods. If the Company had net income for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the no dilutive securities would have been included in the diluted earnings per
share computation for either period. 

Total outstanding potentially dilutive securities were
comprised of the following: 

Note 14. Endorsement Agreements  

Arnold Schwarzenegger   

In July 2013, the Company entered into an Endorsement
Licensing and Co-Branding Agreement by and among the Company, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Marine MP, LLC, and Fitness Publications,
Inc. Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Schwarzenegger was co-developing a special Arnold Schwarzenegger product line being
co-marketed under Mr. Schwarzenegger s name and likeness. In connection with this agreement, the Company also issued to Marine
MP, LLC fully vested restricted shares of common stock with an aggregate market value of $8.5 million. The issuance was being amortized
over the original three-year term of the agreement to  Advertising and promotion  expense. 

Table of Contents  

In May 2016, the Company received written notice to
terminate the Endorsement Licensing and Co-Branding Agreement effective immediately. As a result, $2.1 million of intangible assets,
prepaid assets and inventory related to the Arnold Schwarzenegger product line was written off as an impairment expense. The agreement
to terminate the product line stipulates that no further use of his likeness or sales of the inventory were allowed and therefore,
the Company disposed all the remaining product in inventory and other related assets. The Company is engaged in a dispute with
Mr. Schwarzenegger concerning the termination of the Endorsement Licensing and Co-Branding Agreement. See Note 10 for further details. 

   ETW   

 In July 2014, the Company entered into an Endorsement
Agreement with ETW. Under the terms of the agreement, Tiger Woods agreed to endorse certain of the Company s products and

 In conjunction with this agreement, the Company issued
446,853 shares of the Company s restricted common stock to ETW, with an aggregate market value of $5.0 million. The shares
were amortized over the original four-year term of the agreement. The current and non-current portions of the unamortized stock
compensation were initially included as a component of  Prepaid stock compensation  in the Condensed Consolidated Balance
Sheets. The amount of unamortized stock compensation expense of $3.5 million related to this agreement was written off in connection
with the restructuring plan disclosed further in Note 4. 

 In May 2016, the Company entered into a settlement
agreement with ETW, which eliminates all costs and terminates all future commitments under the Endorsement Agreement. Pursuant
to the settlement agreement, the Company paid ETW $2.2 million to terminate the parties  obligations under Endorsement Agreement
and to resolve all disputes between the parties. As a result, the Company adjusted its restructuring accrual balance from $7.0
million to $2.2 million according to the settlement agreement and recorded an expense credit of $4.8 million during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. 

   Johnny Manziel   

 In July 2014, the Company entered into an Endorsement
Agreement for the services of Johnny Manziel. As part of this agreement, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 100,000 shares
of its common stock at an exercise price of $11.90 per share. The warrants vest monthly over a period of 24 months beginning August 15,
2014, and have a five-year contractual term. The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of $0 and $17,000 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $6,000 and $50,000 for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively, related to these warrants, which is included as a component of  Advertising and promotion 
expense in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company used the Black-Scholes model to determine
the estimated fair value of the warrants, with the following assumptions: contractual life of five years, risk free interest
rate of 1.7%, dividend yield of 0%, and expected volatility of 55%. In connection with the restructuring disclosed in Note 4, the
Company notified Johnny Manziel of its intention to terminate the endorsement agreement; however, Johnny Manziel has disputed the
termination notice. As of September 30, 2016, all shares were vested under the warrant. 

  Note 15. Income Taxes  

 The Company did not record an additional tax provision
for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The Company recorded an income tax provision $71,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015, and $138,000 and $104,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, related to foreign income
taxes and federal and state minimum taxes. 

 Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions
reported in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and consist of taxes currently due. Deferred taxes relate to differences
between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting which will be either taxable or deductible when
the assets or liabilities are recovered or settled. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers
whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate
realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which
those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities,
projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on consideration of these items,
management has established a full valuation allowance as it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will not be realized
as of September 30, 2016.

Note 18. Subsequent Events  

GAAP requires an entity to disclose events that occur
after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued ( subsequent events )
as well as the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events. There are two types of subsequent events. The first
type consists of events or transactions that provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the date of the balance
sheet, including the estimates inherent in the process of preparing financial statements, ( recognized subsequent events ).
The second type consists of events that provide evidence about conditions that did not exist at the date of the balance sheet
but arose subsequent to that date ( non-recognized subsequent events ). The following significant non-recognized subsequent
events occurred as of the date of this filing. 

As previously disclosed, the Company has been
engaged in a dispute with F.H.G. Corporation (d/b/a Capstone Nutrition), INI Parent, Inc., INI Buyer, Inc. and Medley Capital
Corporation (together,  Capstone ) arising out of a Manufacturing Agreement between the parties. On November 7,
2016, the parties executed a settlement agreement (the  Settlement Agreement ). Under the Settlement Agreement,
the Company has agreed to pay to Capstone cash in the amount of $11.0 million within five business days following the
execution of the Settlement Agreement. All pending litigation will be dismissed with prejudice. The Settlement Agreement
releases all parties from any and all claims, actions, causes of action, suits, controversies or counterclaims that the
parties have had, now have or thereafter can, shall or may have. The Company will also issue to INI Buyer, Inc. a warrant to
purchase an amount of the Company s common stock equal to 7.5% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the
Company on a fully diluted basis as of the date of execution of the warrant agreement, estimated to be approximately
1,289,378 shares of Company common stock (the  Warrant ). The exercise price of the Warrant will be $1.83 per share, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances provided for therein, with a term of four years.  The Company has valued
these warrants by utilizing the Black Scholes model at approximately $1.9 million based upon the best available information
as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The Warrant will be subject to adjustment upon certain events provided
for therein. 

The Company has approximately $21.9 million
in accounts payable and accrued liabilities associated with the Capstone liability. Based upon the amounts included herein,
the Company anticipates recording a gain of approximately $8.9 million based on the Capstone settlement. Due to the
nature of this gain contingency, the Company has not reflected these amounts in its third quarter Condensed Consolidated
Balance Sheet and Statement of Operations. The Company intends to record this transaction in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

In conjunction with the above transaction, on November 8, 2016, the Company entered into
a convertible secured promissory note agreement (the  2016 Convertible Note ) with Mr. Ryan Drexler, the Company s
Chairman of the Board, Interim Chief Executive Officer and Interim President, pursuant to which Mr. Drexler loaned the Company
$11.0 million. Proceeds from the note were used to fund the Settlement Agreement. The 2016 Convertible Note is secured by
all assets and properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, whether tangible or intangible. The 2016 Convertible Note carries
interest at a rate of 10% per annum, or 12% if there is an event of default. Both the principal and the interest under the 2016
Convertible Note are due in November 2017, unless converted earlier. Mr. Drexler may convert the outstanding principal and accrued
interest into shares of the Company s common stock for $1.83 per share at any time (estimated to be approximately 6,010,929
shares as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). The Company may prepay the 2016 Convertible Note at the aggregate
principal amount therein, plus accrued interest, by giving Mr. Drexler between 15 and 60 days  notice depending upon the
specific circumstances, provided that Mr. Drexler may convert the 2016 Convertible Note during the applicable notice period. The
Company intends to record this liability as a convertible note with a related party in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

The following discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related
notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the  Form 10-Q ), and with our audited consolidated
financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on March 17, 2016, or the 2015 Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve
risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute
to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section entitled  Risk
Factors  included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.  Except as otherwise indicated herein, the terms  Company, 
 we,   our  and  us  refer to MusclePharm Corporation and its subsidiaries.  

Overview  

We are a scientifically
driven, performance lifestyle company that develops, manufactures, markets and distributes branded nutritional supplements.
We offer a broad range of powders, capsules, tablets, gels and bars. Our portfolio of recognized brands, including MusclePharm        Sport
Series, and FitMiss       , are marketed and sold
in more than 120 countries and available in over 50,000 retail outlets globally. These clinically developed scientifically driven
nutritional supplements are developed through a six-stage research process that utilizes the expertise of leading nutritional scientists,
doctors and universities. We believe we are an innovator in the sports nutrition industry.  

Our primary growth strategy is to: 

drive innovation, serve the needs of all athletes and fuel the engine of sport through new products and brand extensions;   

increase our product distribution and sales through increased market penetrations both domestically and internationally;   

increase our margins by negotiating reductions in the cost of our products;   

continue to conduct additional testing of the safety and efficacy of our products and formulate new products to differentiate
our products from our competition; and   

increase awareness of our products through marketing and branding opportunities with cost effective brand partnerships and
grass roots marketing and advertising.   

Restructuring Plan  

On August 24, 2015, our Board of Directors, or the
Board, approved a restructuring plan for us. The approved restructuring plan was designed to reduce costs and to better align
our resources for profitable growth. Specifically, through September 30, 2016, the restructuring plan resulted in: 1) a reduction
in our workforce; 2) abandoning certain leased facilities; 3) renegotiating or terminating a number of contracts with endorsers
in a strategic shift away from such arrangements and towards more cost effective marketing and advertising efforts; 4) discontinuing
a number of product SKU s due to lower than expected revenue or margin performance and writing down inventory to net realizable
value; and 5) writing off certain assets. We completed additional reductions in workforce during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and closed two facilities. Management has completed the approved restructuring plan, and as such, we do not anticipate
any additional restructuring charges.  

Outlook  

As we continue to execute our growth strategy and
restructuring plan, we anticipate continued improvement in our operating margins and expense structure. The termination of the
Arnold Schwarzenegger product-line licensing agreement, discontinuance of unprofitable SKUs and product families, as well as the
migration to new product suppliers have impacted revenue growth for the short-term. However, we anticipate revenue and gross margin
to strengthen as we increase focus on our core products including our MusclePharm  Sport Series products. In addition, the
sale of our wholly-owned subsidiary, BioZone, in May 2016 enables us to further narrow our focus on core MusclePharm products and
further innovate to develop new products. We also anticipate continued savings in advertising and promotions expenses as we focus
on effective marketing and advertising strategies and move away from celebrity endorsements. 

 Although we may experience additional losses for the
near term, we believe that our restructuring plan, which includes a reduction in ongoing operating costs and expense controls,
may enable us to be profitable; however, we may need to continue to raise capital in order to execute our business plan. There
can be no assurance that such capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all.

following table presents our operating results as a percentage of revenue, net for the periods presented:  

Table of Contents  

Revenue, net   

We derive our revenue through the sales of our various
branded nutritional supplements. Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred,
the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery of the
products. We record sales incentives as a direct reduction of revenue for various discounts provided to our customers consisting
primarily of volume incentive rebates and advertising related credits. We accrue for sales discounts over the period they are earned. Sales
discounts are a significant part of our marketing plan to our customers as they help drive increased sales and brand awareness
with end users through promotions that we support through our distributors and re-sellers. 

Net revenue decreased $3.3 million, or 9.7%, to $30.7
million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $34.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Net
revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased primarily due to the termination of the Arnold Schwarzenegger product-line
licensing agreement, the sale of our BioZone subsidiary, and certain other products being discontinued and the migration of some
existing products to a new supplier. Revenue from our BioZone subsidiary was $2.4 million for the three months ended September
30, 2015. Discounts and sales allowances increased as a percentage of gross revenue to 26.1%, or $10.8 million, for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 from 14.7% of gross revenue, or $5.9 million, for the same period in 2015. The increase in discounts and
allowances as a percentage of revenue is primarily related to higher coupon promotions and discount rates on the current quarter s
product mix. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, our
largest customer, Costco Wholesale Corporation, or Costco, individually accounted for more than 10% of our net revenue, representing
21% of our net revenue. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, our two largest customers, Costco and GNC Holdings Inc.,
or GNC, each individually accounted for more than 10% of our net revenue, and in total represented 28% of our net revenue. 

Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin   

Cost of revenue for MusclePharm products is directly
related to the production, manufacturing and freight-in of the related products purchased from third party contract manufacturers.
We mainly ship customer orders from our distribution centers in Spring Hill, Tennessee and Pittsburg, California, the latter of
which was closed during the three months ended September 30, 2016. The facilities are operated with our equipment and employees,
and we own the related inventory. We also use contract manufacturers to drop ship products directly to our customers. 

In addition, BioZone manufactured products and, therefore,
derived costs of revenue through the costs of raw materials, direct labor, freight-in and other supply and equipment expenses.
We mainly shipped BioZone customer orders from our distribution center in Pittsburg, California. We completed the sale of BioZone
sold during the second quarter of 2016, and closed the distribution center during the third quarter of 2016. 

Our historical experience has been that, over the life
cycle of a particular product, the cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue has typically declined as a result of efficiencies
and resulting decreases in our product costs. The decrease in cost generally results from an increase in the volume purchased from
manufacturing suppliers, as well as yield improvements and test enhancements. 

Our gross profit fluctuates due to several factors, including
sales incentives, new product introductions and upgrades to existing product lines, changes in customer and product mixes, the
mix of product demand, shipment volumes, our product costs, pricing and inventory write-downs. Cost of revenue is expected to decrease
over time as a percentage of revenue due primarily to our focus on supply chain efficiency and negotiating better pricing with
our manufacturers. 

Cost of revenue decreased 12.8% to $20.5 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $23.5 million for the same period in 2015. Accordingly, gross profit for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 remained relatively flat, decreasing $0.3 million to $10.2 million compared to $10.5
million for the same period 2015. However, gross profit margin increased to 33.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2016
compared to 30.8% for the same period in 2015.

Operating Expenses   

 Operating expenses for the three months ended September
30, 2016 were $11.5 million, compared to $37.5 million for the same period in 2015. During the three months ended September
2015, we commenced our restructuring plan, which resulted in $16.7 million of expense compared to $1.7 million during the current
quarter. Additionally, our advertising and promotion expenses decreased $5.2 million due to our focus on lower cost advertising,
including social media. See additional discussion below. 

   Advertising and Promotion   

 Our advertising and promotions consists primarily
of athletic endorsements, and sponsorships which includes both cash and stock-based compensation, promotional giveaways, trade
show events, food, drug, and mass distribution costs, and digital, print, and media advertising. 

 Prior to our restructuring during the third quarter
of 2015, advertising and promotions were a large part of both our growth strategy and brand awareness. We built strategic partnerships
with sports athletes and fitness enthusiasts through endorsements, licensing, and co-branding agreements. Additionally, we co-developed
products with sports athletes and teams. We expect our advertising and promotion expenses to decrease in future periods as we seek
to leverage existing brand recognition and move towards lower cost advertising outlets including social media. 

 Advertising and promotion expenses decreased 73.1% to
$1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, or 6% of revenue, compared to $7.1 million, or 21% of revenue, for
the same period in 2015. Advertising and promotion expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 included expenses
related to strategic partnerships with athletes and sports teams. The expense associated with these partnerships decreased by $3.5
million as our agreement with the UFC expired during the fourth quarter of 2015 and we renegotiated or terminated a number of contracts
as part of our restructuring activities. Additionally, miscellaneous advertising expenses decreased by $0.8 million, fees paid
for athlete appearances decreased by $0.7 million, trade show expense decreased by $0.3 million and product giveaway costs decreased
by $0.4 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in partnership advertising of $0.5 million. 

Salaries and Benefits   

Salaries and benefits consist primarily of salaries,
bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation. Personnel costs are a significant component of our operating expenses. During the
third quarter of 2015, we executed a restructuring plan, resulting in a reduction in our workforce that concluded during the third
quarter of 2016. Salaries and benefits are anticipated to continue to decrease due to potential additional headcount reductions,
limited headcount additions, as well as a reduction of future restricted stock awards, and a reduction in amortization of existing
stock-based grants. 

 Salaries and benefits decreased 59.7% to $2.3 million,
or 8% of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $5.7 million, or 17% of revenue, for the same period
in 2015. Stock-based compensation expense decreased $2.2 million and other compensation expense decreased by $1.2 million related
to the reduction of headcount as part of the restructuring plan, and compensation paid to former CEO Brad Pyatt who resigned from
the Company in March 2016 (see Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). 

   Selling, General and Administrative   

 Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist
primarily of freight out, depreciation, amortization, IT equipment and network, facilities related expenses, insurance, director s
fees, which include both cash and stock-based compensation, rental expenses related to equipment leases, supplies, legal settlement
costs, and other corporate expenses. 

Table of Contents  

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased
15.3% to $3.9 million, or 13% of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $4.6 million, or 13% of revenue,
for the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower office expenses, including rent, of $0.4 million, and lower
depreciation and amortization of $0.3 million. 

Research and Development   

Research and development expenses consist primarily of
R D personnel salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation, product quality control, which includes third-party
testing, and research fees related to the development of new products. We expense research and development costs as incurred. Research
and development is not a primary driver of our operating expenses and we expect research and development to decrease in future
periods, as we have reduced the number of employees in this department. 

Research and development expenses decreased
81.2% to $0.3 million, or 1% of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.4 million, or 4% of
revenue for the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to sale of BioZone and a reduction in salaries and benefits and
research fees. 

Professional Fees   

Professional fees consist primarily of legal fees, accounting
and audit fees, consulting fees, which includes both cash and stock-based compensation, and investor relations costs. We expect
our professional fees to increase or remain flat as we utilize professional service providers to defend ongoing and new legal matters
and advise on corporate governance, internal controls, and process improvements. 

Professional fees decreased 33.6% to $1.3 million, or
4% of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2.0 million, or 6% of revenue for the same period in
2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in public relations fees of $0.7 million, offset by an increase in legal
fees of $0.2 million. 

Restructuring and Other Charges   

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, restructuring
and other charges were $1.7 million, compared to $16.7 million for the same period in 2015, when the restructuring plan commenced.
Restructuring expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily related to closing the accounting and administration
office in Denver, Colorado and the distribution center in Pittsburg, California. 

For the three months
ended September 30, 2015, we incurred a total restructuring and other charges of $17.9 million, of which $16.6 million was
recorded in operating expenses. The restructuring charges to be paid in cash totaled $8.2 million, which are comprised of: (i) severance
and termination benefit costs related to the terminated employees of $1.2 million; (ii) charge of $6.6 million related to
cancellation of certain contracts and sponsorship agreements; and (iii) costs associated with permanently vacating certain
facilities of $0.4 million. Other non-cash charges associated with the restructuring totaled $8.4 million, which are comprised
of: (i) stock-based compensation of terminated employees of $1.7 million; (ii) write-down of prepaid stock compensation
related to terminated endorsement agreements, discontinued products, and abandoned other agreements including related prepaid assets
of $6.4 million; and (iii) write-off of long-lived assets related to the abandonment of certain lease facilities of $0.4
million.  

Impairment of Assets   

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, $0.1
million of inventory related to the Arnold Schwarzenegger product line was written off. The agreement to terminate the product
line stipulates that no further use of his likeness or sales of the inventory were allowed and therefore, we disposed of all the
remaining product in inventory. 

Table of Contents  

Other Expense, net   

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, other expense, net consists of the following (in thousands): 

The decrease in other expense, net was primarily related
to foreign currency transaction gains and losses due to the U.S. Dollar remaining constant, compared to the same period in 2015. 

 We expect interest expense to increase in the near
term, related to interest on the convertible secured promissory note that we entered into in December 2015 and the secured borrowing
arrangement we entered into in January 2016. 

   Provision for Income Taxes   

Provision for income taxes consists primarily of federal
and state income taxes in the United States and income taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Due to uncertainty
as to the realization of benefits from our deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carry-forwards, research and development
and other tax credits, we have a full valuation allowance reserved against such assets. We expect to maintain this full valuation
allowance at least in the near term.

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September
30, 2016 to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  

(1)   Cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 included restructuring charges of $2.3 million and $1.3
million, respectively, related to write-down of inventory for discontinued products.   

The
following table presents our operating results as a percentage of revenue, net for the periods presented:  

Table of Contents  

Revenue, net   

Net revenue decreased $19.3 million, or 15.3%, to $106.5
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $125.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net
revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased primarily due to the termination of the Arnold Schwarzenegger product-line
licensing agreement, the sale of our BioZone subsidiary, certain other products being discontinued and the migration of some existing
products to a new supplier. Revenue from our BioZone subsidiary decreased $5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Discounts and sales allowances increased to 20.8% of gross revenue, or $27.9 million,
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 13.7% of gross revenue, or $19.9 million for the same period in 2015. The increase
in discounts and allowances is primarily related to promotions of new product introductions and discounts and allowances on existing
products with key customers. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our
two largest customers, Costco and GNC, each individually accounted for more than 10% of our net revenue, and in total represented
30% of our net revenue. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, our three largest customers, Costco, GNC, and Bodybuilding.com,
each individually accounted for more than 10% of our net revenue, and in total represented 42% of our net revenue. 

Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit   

Costs of revenue decreased 15.6% to $70.4 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $83.4 million for the same period in 2015. Accordingly, gross profit for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $6.3 million to $36.1 million compared to $42.4 million for the same period
2015. Gross profit margin increased to 33.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 33.7% for the same period
in 2015, remaining relatively flat. 

Operating Expenses   

Operating expenses for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 were $44.7 million, compared to $83.3 million for the same period in 2015. During the three months ended September
2015, we commenced our restructuring plan, which resulted in $16.7 million of expense compared to a credit of $2.6 million during
the current year. Additionally, our advertising and promotion expenses decreased $13.7 million due to our focus on lower cost advertising,
including social media and our salaries and benefits decreased by $5.3 million. See additional discussion below. 

   Advertising and Promotion   

Advertising and promotion expenses decreased 60.7% to
$8.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, or 8% of revenue, compared to $22.6 million, or 18% of revenue, for
the same period in 2015. Advertising and promotion expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 included expenses
related to strategic partnerships with athletes and sports teams. The expense associated with these partnerships decreased by $9.7
million as our agreement with the UFC expired during the fourth quarter of 2015 and we renegotiated or terminated a number of contracts
as part of our restructuring activities. Additionally, miscellaneous advertising expenses decreased by $1.9 million, product giveaway
costs decreased by $1.3 million, fees paid for athlete appearances decreased by $1.2 million, and trade show expense decreased
by $0.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in partnership advertising of $1.3 million.

Salaries and Benefits   

Salaries and benefits decreased 25.9% to $15.2 million,
or 14% of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $20.5 million, or 16% of revenue, for the same period
in 2015. Stock-based compensation expense decreased $3.3 million and other compensation expense decreased by $2.0 million related
to the reduction of headcount as part of the restructuring plan. These cost reductions were offset by compensation paid to former
CEO Brad Pyatt who resigned from the Company in March 2016 (see Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements) and
accounts for $5.9 million of the $15.2 million of salaries and benefits. Without this isolated event, salaries and benefits for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 would have been $9.3 million, which would have been a 54.6% reduction compared to the
same period in 2015. 

Selling, General and Administrative   

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased
14.4% to $12.6 million, or 12% of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $14.7 million, or 12% of revenue,
for the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower office expenses, including rent, of $0.6 million, lower fees
of $0.5 million, which included a one-time restricted share grant to a financial institution of $0.3 million in 2015 and other
bank fees, lower depreciation and amortization $0.4 million, a decrease in customer non-compliance fees of $0.3 million and other
miscellaneous cost savings, offset by a $0.3 million increase related to information technology. 

   Research and Development   

 Research and development expenses decreased
49.9% to $1.7 million, or 2% or revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $3.3 million, or 3% of
revenue, for the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the sale of BioZone and a reduction in salaries
and benefits and research fees. 

   Professional Fees   

Professional fees decreased 19.2% to $4.4 million, or
4% of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $5.5 million for the same period in 2015. The decrease
was primarily due to a decrease in public relations fees of $1.3 million, fees related to the SEC investigation of $0.5 million,
and lower consulting fees of $0.3 million. These decreases were offset by an increase in legal fees of $1.2 million. 

Restructuring and Other Charges   

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
recorded a credit in  Restructuring and other charges  of $2.6 million comprised of: (i) an expense credit of
$4.8 million related to the release of a restructuring accrual of $7.0 million, offset by the cash payment of $2.2 million related
to the settlement agreement which terminated all future commitments between ETW Corporation, or ETW, and the Company (see Note
14 to the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements); (ii) $1.3 million related to write-off of long-lived assets
related to the abandonment of certain lease facilities; and (iii) $0.9 million related to severance and other employee compensation
costs. With the restructuring plan substantially complete, the Company does not anticipate incurring any additional restructuring
charges for the remainder of 2016. 

For the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, we incurred a total restructuring and other charges of $17.9 million, of which $16.6 million was
recorded in operating expenses. The restructuring charges to be paid in cash totaled $8.2 million, which are comprised of: (i) severance
and termination benefit costs related to the terminated employees of $1.2 million; (ii) charge of $6.6 million related to
cancellation of certain contracts and sponsorship agreements; and (iii) costs associated with permanently vacating certain
facilities of $0.4 million. Other non-cash charges associated with the restructuring totaled $8.4 million, which are comprised

Impairment of Assets   

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
we determined that certain prepaid manufacturing costs and our investment in a warrant to purchase Capstone s parent
company, which totaled $2.4 million, were impaired due to Capstone s sale of their primary powder manufacturing
facility in June 2016, the termination of our manufacturing relationship with them and the ongoing litigation. See additional
information in Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, $2.1 million of intangible assets, prepaid assets and inventory related to the Arnold Schwarzenegger
product line was written off. Per the agreement to terminate the product line, no further use of his likeness or sales of the
inventory were allowed and therefore, we disposed of all the remaining product in inventory. 

Other Expense, net   

During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, other expense, net consists of the following (in thousands): 

Net other expense for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 increased 30.8%, or $0.3 million, compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in net other expense was primarily
related to financing and factoring fees and other miscellaneous expenses, offset by $0.9 million gain related to foreign currency
translation rates. 

Loss on Sale of Subsidiary   

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we sold
a wholly-owned subsidiary, BioZone, for a loss of $2.1 million. See additional information in Note 6 to the accompanying Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements. The loss on the sale of BioZone primarily related to the subsidiary s pre-tax losses for
2016. Pre-tax loss for BioZone for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1.5 million, which represented the operations
through the disposition date in May 2016.

Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA  

In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance
with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, this Form 10-Q discloses Adjusted EBITDA, which is net loss adjusted
for income taxes, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, amortization of intangible assets, provision for doubtful
accounts, amortization of prepaid stock compensation, amortization of prepaid sponsorship fees, stock-based compensation, issuance
of common stock warrants, other expense, net, loss on sale of subsidiary, restructuring and asset impairment charges. Management
believes that these non-GAAP measures provide investors with important additional perspectives into our ongoing business performance. 

The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA is
net loss. The non GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net loss. Adjusted
EBITDA is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP and has important limitations as an analytical tool and should not be
considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA excludes
some, but not all, items that affect net loss and is defined differently by different companies, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA
may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. 

Set forth below are reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to our reported
GAAP net loss (in thousands):

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Since the inception of MusclePharm, other than cash from
product sales, our primary source of cash has been from the sale of equity, issuance of convertible secured promissory notes and
other short-term debt as discussed below. In January 2016, we entered into a factoring facility agreement with Prestige Capital
Corporation. The maximum total advances outstanding at any time under this agreement is $10.0 million. 

As of September 30, 2016, our cash balance was approximately
$5.9 million, which consists primarily of cash on deposit with banks. Our principal use of cash is to purchase inventory, pay for
operating expenses, acquire capital assets and historically to repurchase outstanding shares of our capital stock. As of September
30, 2016, we had a deficit in working capital of $21.0 million, an accumulated deficit of $159.8 million and a total stockholders 
deficit of $16.4 million. As of September 30, 2016, we had outstanding borrowings of $6.0 million under our convertible note
with a related party. 

Our management believes that the recently completed restructuring,
which includes a reduction in ongoing operating costs and enhanced expense controls, will enable us ultimately to be profitable;
however, we may need to continue to raise capital in order to execute its business plan. There can be no assurance that such capital
will be available on acceptable terms or at all. 

Our net consolidated cash flows are as follows (in thousands): 

Operating Activities   

Our cash (used in) provided by operating activities is
driven primarily by sales of our products and vendor provided credit. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been
for inventory purchases, advertising and promotion expenses, personnel-related expenditures, manufacturing costs, professional
fees, costs related to our facilities and legal related fees. Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected
principally by the results of operations and the extent to which we increase spending on personnel expenditures, sales and marketing
activities, and our working capital requirements. 

Our operating cash flows were $8.2 million lower for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The variance primarily relates to the net change
in net operating assets and liabilities which resulted in a use of cash of $0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 compared to a source of cash of $20.5 million for the same period in 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the decrease in liabilities related to the restructuring accrual and accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulted in a $4.9
million and a $2.2 million decrease in working capital, respectively. These decreases were offset by a reduction in our accounts
receivable balance, which provided a source of working capital. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, increases in accounts
payable and accrued liabilities provided $18.8 million in working capital. This source was offset by an increase in prepaid sponsorship
and endorsement fees and other prepaid expenses which used $6.5 million and $1.8 million, respectively. These changes in working
capital were offset by net loss adjusted for non-cash charges, which resulted in a source of cash of $0.4 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a use of cash of $12.8 million for the same period in 2015.

Investing Activities   

Cash provided by investing activities was $5.4 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to the cash proceeds from sale of BioZone of $5.9 million, offset by
cash purchases of property and equipment of $0.4 million. 

Cash used in investing
activities of $2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, was primarily due to a cash payment of $0.9 million
related to MusclePharm apparel rights acquisition, investment in contract manufacturer of $1.0 million related to our opportunity
to acquire Capstone and purchase of property and equipment of $1.3 million, partially offset by proceeds from disposal of property
and equipment of $0.4 million.  

Financing Activities   

Cash  used in  financing
activities was $6.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to the repayment on our line of credit
of $3.0 million and repayment of a term loan of $2.9 million. 

Cash used in financing
activities of $2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, was primarily due to repayment on our line of credit
of $5.4 million, partially offset by proceeds from issuance of our term loan of $4.0 million.  

Indebtedness Agreements   

In September 2014, we entered into a line of credit
facility with ANB Bank for up to $8.0 million of borrowings. The line of credit originally matured in September 2017, and
accrued interest at the prime rate plus 2%. The line of credit was secured by inventory, accounts receivable, intangible assets
and equipment. As of December 31, 2015, the outstanding borrowings under the line of credit were $3.0 million. We were not
in compliance with certain financial covenants under the line of credit as of December 31, 2015, which limited further borrowings.
We repaid our outstanding principal and accrued interest under the line of credit in full in January 2016 in conjunction with our
secured borrowing arrangement as described below. This line is no longer available to us. 

In February 2015, we entered into a $4.0 million
term loan agreement with ANB Bank. The term loan carried a fixed interest rate of 5.25% per annum, was repayable in 36 equal
monthly installments of principal and interest, and originally matured in February 2018. The term loan contained various events
of default, including cross default provisions related to the line of credit, which could have required repayments of the term
loan. We were not in compliance with certain financial covenants under the term loan as of December 31, 2015, and received
various waivers from the lender during the year ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the outstanding borrowings
under the term loan were $2.9 million. We repaid our outstanding principal and accrued interest under the term loan in full in
January 2016 to retire the term loan in conjunction with our secured borrowing arrangement as described below. 

In October 2015, we entered into loan modification agreements
with ANB Bank under the line of credit and term loan to: (i) change the maturity date of the loans to January 15, 2016, (ii)
prohibit the loans to be declared in default prior to December 10, 2015, except for defaults resulting from failure to make
timely payments, and (iii) delete certain financial covenants from the line of credit. In consideration for these modifications,
Ryan Drexler, Interim Chief Executive Officer, Interim President and Chairman of the Board, and a family member provided their
individual guaranty for the remaining balance of the term loan and line of credit of $6.2 million. In consideration for executing
his guaranty, we issued to Mr. Drexler 28,571 shares of our common stock with a grant date fair value of $80,000 (based upon
the closing price of our common stock on the date of issuance).

In December 2015, we entered into a convertible secured
promissory note agreement with Mr. Drexler, Interim Chief Executive Officer, Interim President and Chairman of the Board,
pursuant to which he loaned us $6.0 million. Proceeds from the note were used to fund working capital requirements. The convertible
note is secured by all assets and properties of the Company and its subsidiaries whether tangible or intangible. The convertible
note carries an interest at a rate of 8% per annum, or 10% in the event of default. Both the principal and the interest under the
convertible note are due in January 2017, unless converted earlier. The holder can convert the outstanding principal and accrued
interest into shares of common stock (2,608,695 shares) for $2.30 per share at any time. We may prepay the convertible note at
the aggregate principal amount therein plus accrued interest by giving the holder between 15 and 60 day-notice, depending upon
the specific circumstances, provided that the holder may convert the note during the notice period. We recorded the convertible
note of $6.0 million as a liability in the balance sheet and also recorded a beneficial conversion feature of $52,000 as a debt
discount upon issuance of the convertible note, which is being amortized over the term of the convertible debt using the effective
interest method. The beneficial conversion feature was calculated based on the difference between the fair value of common stock
and the effective conversion price of the convertible note. As of September 30, 2016, the convertible note had an outstanding principal
balance of $6.0 million. 

In January 2016, we entered into a Purchase and Sale
Agreement (the  Agreement ) with Prestige Capital Corporation ( Prestige ) pursuant to which we agreed
to sell and assign and Prestige agreed to buy and accept, certain accounts receivable owed to us ( Accounts ). Under
the terms of the Agreement, upon the receipt and acceptance of each assignment of Accounts, Prestige will pay us 80% of the net
face amount of the assigned Accounts, up to a maximum total borrowings of $10.0 million subject to sufficient amounts of accounts
receivable to secure the loan. The remaining 20% will be paid to us upon collection of the assigned Accounts, less any chargeback,
disputes, or other amounts due to Prestige. Prestige s purchase of the assigned Accounts from us will be at a discount fee
which varies based on the number of days outstanding from the assignment of Accounts to collection of the assigned Accounts. In
addition, we granted Prestige a continuing security interest in and lien upon all accounts receivable, inventory, fixed assets,
general intangibles and other assets. The Agreement s initial term of six months has been extended by the Company to March
31, 2017. Prestige may cancel the Agreement with 30-day notice. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we
had no new transactions with Prestige. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we sold to Prestige accounts with an aggregate
face amount of approximately $49.3 million, for which Prestige paid to us approximately $39.5 million in cash. During the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016, $8.7 million and $40.0 million was subsequently repaid to Prestige, including
fees and interest. The proceeds from the initial assignment to Prestige under this secured borrowing arrangement were primarily
utilized to pay off the balance of the existing line of credit and term loan with ANB Bank. 

Contractual Obligations  

Our principal commitments consist of obligations under
operating leases for office and warehouse facilities, capital leases for manufacturing and warehouse equipment, debt, restructuring
liability and non-cancelable endorsement and sponsorship agreements. 

We presented our contractual obligations in our 2015
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. There have been no other material changes outside of the ordinary course
of business in those obligations during the current quarter. 

Going Concern Opinion  

Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion in their
report on our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. We have not established an ongoing source of revenue
sufficient to cover our operating costs and are dependent on obtaining adequate capital to continue operations, which raises substantial
doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. See  Item 1A. Risk Factors Because our auditors have issued
a going concern opinion, there is a substantial uncertainty that we will continue operations, in which case you could lose your
investment  in our 2015 Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and Note 1 to our accompanying Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as
of September 30, 2016. 

Table of Contents  

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

The preparation of accompanying Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and our discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and operating results require our management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in these
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and
on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences
may be material. 

Note 2,  Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies  in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of
the 2015 Form 10-K, and  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  in Part I, Item 7 of the 2015 Form 10-K describe
the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. There
have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since the 2015 Form 10-K. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk  

We are exposed to market risks related to changes to
foreign currency exchange rates. 

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk  

We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue
and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, primarily the Canadian Dollar and more recently the
Euro and the Australian Dollar. In general, we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Accordingly, changes
in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. Dollar, will negatively affect our non-dollar denominated revenue
and other operating results as expressed in U.S. Dollars. 

 We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations
in our net loss as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain current asset and current liability balances
that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time,
we have not entered into, but in the future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge
our foreign currency exchange risk. It is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations.
We recognized foreign currency gain of $19,000 and $0.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

Our management, with the participation of our interim chief executive officer ("CEO") who is our interim principal executive officer and is temporarily performing the function of our principal financial officer while there is a vacancy in that position, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act")), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our interim CEO has concluded that as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control  

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the third
quarter of 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures  

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and
procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures
must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits
of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION  

    Item 1. Legal Proceedings  

   Contingencies   

In the normal course of business or otherwise, the Company
may become involved in legal proceedings. The Company will accrue a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability
has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable
amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the
minimum amount in the range is accrued. The accrual for a litigation loss contingency might include, for example, estimates of
potential damages, outside legal fees and other directly related costs expected to be incurred. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the Company was involved in the several material legal proceedings described in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Legal proceedings that became reportable events, or had material developments in the current quarter, are described below. 

Arnold Schwarzenegger   

The Company is engaged in a dispute with Arnold
Schwarzenegger, Marine MP, LLC,   Fitness Publications, Inc. ( AS Parties ) concerning amounts allegedly owed
under the parties  Endorsement Licensing and Co-Branding Agreement. In May 2016, the contract was terminated, and the
AS Parties commenced arbitration, alleging that the Company breached the parties  agreement and misappropriated
Schwarzenegger s likeness. They seek more than $13.0 million for royalties, purported misuse of Schwarzenegger s
likeness, and attorney fees. The Company filed its response and counterclaimed for breach of contract and breach of the
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The parties are engaged in discovery. 

Manchester City Football Group   

The Company is engaged in a dispute with City Football
Group Limited ( CFG ), the owner of Manchester City Football Group, concerning amounts allegedly owed by the Company
under a Sponsorship Agreement with CFG. In August 2016, CFG commenced arbitration in the United Kingdom against the Company, seeking
approximately $8.3 million for the Company s purported breach of the Agreement. The Company answered on October 7, 2016.
An arbitrator has not yet been appointed and discovery has not yet begun. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors  

There have been no material changes to the Risk Factors
as disclosed in our 2015 Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on March 17, 2016.

 See Part I above. 

  Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures  

 None. 

    Item 5. Other Information.  

As previously disclosed, the Company has been engaged
in a dispute with F.H.G. Corporation (d/b/a Capstone Nutrition), INI Parent, Inc., INI Buyer, Inc. and Medley Capital Corporation
(together,  Capstone ) arising out of a Manufacturing Agreement between the parties. On November 7, 2016, the parties
executed a settlement agreement (the  Settlement Agreement ). Under the Settlement Agreement, the Company has agreed
to pay to Capstone cash in the amount of $11.0 million within five business days following the execution of the Settlement Agreement.
All pending litigation will be dismissed with prejudice. The Settlement Agreement releases all parties from any and all claims,
actions, causes of action, suits, controversies or counterclaims that the parties have had, now have or thereafter can, shall or
may have. The Company will also issue to INI Buyer, Inc. a warrant to purchase an amount of the Company s common stock equal
to 7.5% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company on a fully diluted basis as of the date of execution of the
warrant agreement, estimated to be approximately 1,289,378 shares of Company common stock (the  Warrant ). The exercise price of the Warrant will be $1.83 per share, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances provided for therein, with a term of four years.
The Company has valued these warrants by utilizing the Black Scholes model at approximately $1.9 million based upon the best available
information as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The Warrant will be subject to adjustment upon certain events
provided for therein. 

The Company has approximately $21.9 million
in accounts payable and accrued liabilities associated with the Capstone liability. Based upon the amounts included herein,
the Company anticipates recording a gain of approximately $8.9 million  based on the Capstone settlement. Due to the
nature of this gain contingency, the Company has not reflected these amounts in its third quarter Condensed Consolidated
Balance Sheet and Statement of Operations. The Company intends to record this transaction in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

In conjunction with the above transaction, on November 8, 2016, the Company entered into
a convertible secured promissory note agreement (the  2016 Convertible Note ) with Mr. Ryan Drexler, the Company s
Chairman of the Board, Interim Chief Executive Officer and Interim President, pursuant to which Mr. Drexler loaned the Company
$11.0 million. Proceeds from the note were used to fund the Settlement Agreement. The 2016 Convertible Note is secured by
all assets and properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, whether tangible or intangible. The 2016 Convertible Note carries
interest at a rate of 10% per annum, or 12% if there is an event of default. Both the principal and the interest under the 2016
Convertible Note are due in November 2017, unless converted earlier. Mr. Drexler may convert the outstanding principal and accrued
interest into shares of the Company s common stock for $1.83 per share at any time (estimated to be approximately 6,010,929
shares as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). The Company may prepay the 2016 Convertible Note at the aggregate
principal amount therein, plus accrued interest, by giving Mr. Drexler between 15 and 60 days  notice depending upon the
specific circumstances, provided that Mr. Drexler may convert the 2016 Convertible Note during the applicable notice period. The
Company intends to record this liability as a convertible note with a related party in the fourth quarter of 2016.

 (d)               
  Fractional Shares . The Company shall not be required to issue a fractional Warrant Share upon exercise of any Warrant.
As to any fraction of a Warrant Share that the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such exercise, the Company shall
pay to such Holder an amount in cash (by delivery of a certified or official bank check or by wire transfer of immediately available
funds) equal to the product of (i) such fraction multiplied by (ii) the Fair Market Value of one Warrant Share on the Exercise
Date. 
 
        5  

(e)               
  Delivery of New Warrant . Unless the purchase rights represented by this Warrant shall have expired or shall have
been fully exercised, the Company shall, at the time of delivery of the certificate or certificates representing the Warrant Shares
being issued in accordance with  Section 3(c)  hereof, deliver to the Holder a new Warrant (with the same terms) evidencing
the rights of the Holder to purchase the unexpired and unexercised Warrant Shares called for by this Warrant. Such new Warrant
shall in all other respects be identical to this Warrant. 

 (f)                
  Valid Issuance of Warrant and Warrant Shares; Payment of Expenses . With respect to the exercise of this warrant,
the Company hereby represents, covenants and agrees:

 This Warrant is, and any Warrant issued in substitution for or replacement of this Warrant shall be, upon issuance, duly
authorized and validly issued. 

 (ii)              
 All Warrant Shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant pursuant to the terms hereof shall be, upon issuance, validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and free and clear of all taxes, liens and charges. 

 (iii)            
 The Company shall take all reasonable actions as may be necessary to ensure that all such Warrant Shares are issued without
violation by the Company of any applicable law or governmental regulation or any requirements of any domestic securities exchange
upon which shares of Common Stock or other securities constituting Warrant Shares may be listed at the time of such exercise. 

 (iv)             
 The Company shall pay all of its expenses in connection with, and all taxes and other governmental charges that may be imposed
on the Company with respect to, the issuance or delivery of Warrant Shares upon exercise of this Warrant other than taxes or other
governmental charges that may be due from the Holder. 

 (g)               
  Conditional Exercise . Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if an exercise of any portion of this Warrant is
to be made in connection with a public offering or a sale of the Company (pursuant to a merger, sale of stock, or otherwise), such
exercise may at the election of the Holder be conditioned upon the consummation of such transaction, in which case such exercise
shall not be deemed to be effective until immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction. 
 
        6  

(h)               
  Reservation of Shares . During the Exercise Period, the Company shall at all times reserve and keep available out
of its authorized but unissued Common Stock or other securities constituting Warrant Shares, solely for the purpose of issuance
upon the exercise of this Warrant, the maximum number of Warrant Shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant, and the par
value per Warrant Share shall at all times be less than or equal to the applicable Exercise Price. The Company shall not increase
the par value of any Warrant Shares receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant above the Exercise Price then in effect. 

 (i)                 
  No Redemption . This Warrant is not redeemable by the Company, and neither the Company nor any successor thereto will
redeem this Warrant. 

 4.                  
  Capitalization.   

 (a)               
 As of the date of this Warrant, the authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 100,000,000 shares of Common Stock,
par value $0.001 per share, of which 14,803,315 shares are issued,13,927,694 shares are outstanding, but excludes 875,621 shares
of Common Stock held in treasury. 

 (b)               
  Schedule 1  sets forth, as of the date of this Agreement, all outstanding or authorized (i) stock or other options,
warrants, convertible securities or other rights (including, without limitation, purchase, sell or exchange rights), agreements,
arrangements or commitments of any character relating to the capital stock of the Company or obligating the Company to, directly
or indirectly, issue, sell, purchase or redeem any shares of capital stock of, or any other interest in, the Company. There are
no outstanding options, warrants, rights (including conversion or preemptive rights and rights of first refusal or similar rights)
or agreements, orally or in writing, to purchase or acquire from the Company any shares of Common Stock, or any securities convertible
into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock. 

 5.                  
  Adjustment to Number of Warrant Shares . In order to prevent dilution in certain circumstances set forth herein of
the purchase rights granted under this Warrant, the number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be subject
to adjustment from time to time as provided in this  Section 5  (in each case, after taking into consideration any prior adjustments
pursuant to this  Section 5 ). 

 (a)               
  Adjustment to Number of Warrant Shares Upon Issuance of Common Stock . If the Company shall, at any time during the
Exercise Period, issue or sell, or in accordance with  Section 5(b)  is deemed to have issued or sold, any shares of Common
Stock without consideration or for consideration per share of Common Stock that is less than the Fair Market Value per share of
the Common Stock immediately prior to such issuance or sale, then immediately upon such issuance or sale (or deemed issuance or
sale), the number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant immediately prior to any such issuance or sale (or deemed
issuance or sale) shall be increased to a number of Warrant Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying the number of Warrant
Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant immediately prior to such issuance or sale (or deemed issuance or sale) by a fraction
(which shall in no event be less than one): 
 
        7  

(i)                 
 the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock Deemed Outstanding immediately after such issuance
or sale (or deemed issuance or sale); and 

 (ii)              
 the denominator of which shall be the sum of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock Deemed Outstanding immediately prior
to such issuance or sale (or deemed issuance or sale) plus (B) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate
amount of consideration, if any, received by the Company upon such issuance or sale (or deemed issuance or sale) would purchase
at the Fair Market Value per share of the Common Stock immediately prior to such issuance or sale (or deemed issuance or sale). 

 Whenever during the Exercise Period
the Company issues or sells, or is deemed to have issued or sold, in one transaction or in a series of transactions, more than
an additional 250,000 shares of Common Stock within a 12-month period, the Company shall prepare a certificate signed by an executive
officer setting forth, in reasonable detail, the number of shares issued or sold, or deemed issued or sold, the amount and the
form of the consideration received by the Company and the method of computation of such amount and, as promptly as practicable
(but in any event not later than ten (10) Business Days thereafter), shall cause copies of such certificate to be mailed to the
Holder at the address specified in  Section 12  hereof or at such other address as may be provided to the Company in writing
by the Holder. 

 (b)               
  Effect of Certain Events on Adjustment to Number of Warrant Shares . 

 (i)                 
  Issuance of Options . If the Company shall, at any time or from time to time during Exercise Period, grant or sell
any Options, whether or not such Options or the right to convert or exchange any Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise
of such Options are immediately exercisable, and the price per share (determined as provided in this paragraph and in  Section
5(b)(v) ) for which Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of such Options or upon the conversion or exchange of Convertible
Securities issuable upon the exercise of such Options is less than the Fair Market Value per share of the Common Stock immediately
prior to such issuance or sale, then the total maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options
or upon conversion or exchange of the total maximum amount of Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise of such Options
shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date of granting or sale of such Options (and thereafter shall be 

8  

deemed to be outstanding
for purposes of adjusting the number of Warrant Shares under  Section 5(a) ), at a price per share equal to the quotient obtained
by dividing (A) the sum (which sum shall constitute the applicable consideration received for purposes of  Section 5(a) )
of (x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Company as consideration for the granting or sale of all such Options,
plus (y) the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration payable to the Company upon the exercise of all such Options,
plus (z), in the case of such Options which relate to Convertible Securities, the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration,
if any, payable to the Company upon the issuance or sale of all such Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of all
such Convertible Securities, by (B) the total maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of all such Options
or upon the conversion or exchange of all Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise of all such Options. Except as otherwise
provided in  Section 5(b)(iii) , no further adjustment of the number of Warrant Shares shall be made upon the issuance of
Common Stock or of Convertible Securities upon exercise of such Options or upon the issuance of Common Stock upon conversion or
exchange of Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of such Options. 

 (ii)              
  Issuance of Convertible Securities . If the Company shall, at any time or from time to time during the Exercise Period,
in any manner grant or sell (whether directly or by assumption in a merger or otherwise) any Convertible Securities, whether or
not the right to convert or exchange any such Convertible Securities is immediately exercisable, and the price per share (determined
as provided in this paragraph and in  Section 5(b)(v) ) for which Common Stock is issuable upon the conversion or exchange
of such Convertible Securities is less than the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock immediately prior to such issuance
or sale, then the total maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exchange of the total maximum amount
of such Convertible Securities shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date of granting or sale of such Convertible Securities
(and thereafter shall be deemed to be outstanding for purposes of adjusting the number of Warrant Shares pursuant to  Section
5(a) ), at a price per share equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the sum (which sum shall constitute the applicable
consideration received for purposes of  Section 5(a) ) of (x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Company
as consideration for the granting or sale of such Convertible Securities, plus (y) the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration,
if any, payable to the Company upon the conversion or exchange of all such Convertible Securities, by (B) the total maximum number
of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all such Convertible Securities. Except as otherwise provided
in  Section 5(b)(iii) , (A) no further adjustment of the number of Warrant Shares shall be made upon the issuance of Common
Stock upon conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities and (B) no further adjustment of the number of Warrant Shares
shall be made by reason of the issue or sale of Convertible Securities upon exercise of any Options to 

9  

purchase any such Convertible
Securities for which adjustments of the number of Warrant Shares have been made pursuant to the other provisions of this  Section
5(b) . 

 (iii)            
  Change in Terms of Options or Convertible Securities . Upon any change in any of (A) the total amount received or
receivable by the Company as consideration for the granting or sale of any Options or Convertible Securities referred to in  Section
5(b)(i)  or  Section 5(b)(ii)  hereof, (B) the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to
the Company upon the exercise of any Options or upon the issuance, conversion or exchange of any Convertible Securities referred
to in  Section 5(b)(i)  or  Section 5(b)(ii)  hereof, (C) the rate at which Convertible Securities referred to in  Section
5(b)(i)  or  Section 5(b)(ii)  hereof are convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock, or (D) the maximum number
of shares of Common Stock issuable in connection with any Options referred to in  Section 5(b)(i)  hereof or any Convertible
Securities referred to in  Section 5(b)(ii)  hereof, then (whether or not the original issuance or sale of such Options or
Convertible Securities resulted in an adjustment to the number of Warrant Shares pursuant to this  Section 5 ) the number
of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant at the time of such change shall be adjusted or readjusted, as applicable,
to the number of Warrant Shares which would have been in effect at such time pursuant to the provisions of this  Section 5 
had such Options or Convertible Securities still outstanding provided for such changed consideration, conversion rate or maximum
number of shares, as the case may be, at the time initially granted, issued or sold. 

 (iv)             
 Upon the expiration or termination of any unexercised Option or unconverted or unexchanged Convertible Security (or portion
thereof) which resulted (either upon its original issuance or upon a revision of its terms) in an adjustment to the number of Warrant
Shares pursuant to the terms of this  Section 5 , the number of Warrant Shares shall be readjusted to the number of Warrant
Shares as would have obtained had such Option or Convertible Security (or portion thereof) never been issued. In addition, if at
the time of the consummation of the sale of the Company, Options or Convertible Securities which were included in calculating the
number of Warrant Shares are not exercised or converted, as the case may, at the consummation of the sale of the Company, the number
of Warrant Shares shall be readjusted to the number of Warrant Shares as would have obtained had such Option or Convertible Security
(or portion thereof) never been issued. Any adjustments made to number of Warrant Shares pursuant to Section 5(e) shall be readjusted
in a manner consistent with the terms of this  Section 5(b)(iv) . 

 (v)               
  Calculation of Consideration Received . If the Company shall, at any time or from time to time during the Exercise
Period, issue or sell, or is deemed to have issued or sold in accordance with  Section 5(b) , any shares of Common Stock,
Options or Convertible Securities: (A) for cash, the consideration received therefor shall be deemed to be the net amount received
by the Company therefor; (B) for consideration 

10  

other than cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash received by the
Company shall be the fair value of such consideration, except where such consideration consists of marketable securities, in which
case the amount of consideration received by the Company shall be the market price (as reflected on any securities exchange, quotation
system or association or similar pricing system covering such security) for such securities as of the end of business on the date
of receipt of such securities; (C) for no specifically allocated consideration in connection with an issuance or sale of other
securities of the Company, together comprising one integrated transaction, the amount of the consideration therefor shall be deemed
to be the fair value of such portion of the aggregate consideration received by the Company in such transaction as is attributable
to such shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, as the case may be, issued in such transaction; or (D) to the
owners of the non-surviving entity in connection with any merger in which the Company is the surviving corporation, the amount
of consideration therefor shall be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the net assets and business of the non-surviving
entity as is attributable to such shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, as the case may be, issued to such
owners. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Warrant, the net amount of any cash
consideration and the fair value of any consideration other than cash or marketable securities shall be determined in good faith
jointly by the Board and the Holder;  provided , that if the Board and the Holder are unable to agree on the net amount of
any cash consideration or the fair value of any consideration other than cash or marketable securities within a reasonable period
of time (not to exceed twenty (20) days from the Holder's receipt of a certificate of adjustment pursuant to  Section 5(f)(i) 
relating to the applicable issuance), such net amount of cash or fair value, as applicable, shall be determined by a nationally
recognized investment banking, accounting or valuation firm jointly selected by the Board and the Holder. The determination of
such firm shall be final and conclusive, and the fees and expenses of such valuation firm shall be borne by the Company. 

 (vi)             
  Record Date . For purposes of any adjustment to the number of Warrant Shares in accordance with this  Section 5 ,
in case the Company shall take a record of the holders of its Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them (A) to receive a dividend
or other distribution payable in Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities or (B) to subscribe for or purchase Common Stock,
Options or Convertible Securities, then such record date shall be deemed to be the date of the issue or sale of the shares of Common
Stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such other distribution or the
date of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase, as the case may be. 
 
        11  

(c)               
  Adjustment to Number of Warrant Shares Upon Dividend, Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock . If the Company
shall, at any time or from time to time during the Exercise Period, (i) makes or declares, or fixes a record date for, any dividend
or any other distribution upon the Common Stock or any other capital stock of the Company payable in shares of Common Stock or
in Options or Convertible Securities, or (ii) subdivides (by any stock split, recapitalization or otherwise) its outstanding shares
of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, then in each such case the number of Warrant Shares issuable upon the exercise
of this Warrant immediately prior to any such dividend, distribution or subdivision shall be proportionately increased. If the
Company at any time combines (by combination, reverse stock split or otherwise) its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller
number of shares, the number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant immediately prior to such combination shall
be proportionately decreased. Any adjustment under this  Section 5(c)  shall become effective at the close of business on
the date the dividend, subdivision or combination becomes effective. 

 (d)               
  Adjustment to Number of Warrant Shares Upon Reorganization, Reclassification, Consolidation or Merger . In the event
of any (i) capital reorganization of the Company or (ii) reclassification of the stock of the Company (other than a change in par
value or from par value to no par value or from no par value to par value or as a result of a stock dividend or subdivision, split-up
or combination of shares), (iii) consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another Person, (iv) sale of all or substantially
all of the Company's assets to another Person or (v) other similar transaction (other than any such transaction covered by  Section
5(c)  hereof), in each case which entitles the holders of Common Stock to receive (either directly or upon subsequent liquidation)
stock, securities or assets with respect to or in exchange for Common Stock, each Warrant shall, immediately after such reorganization,
reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale or similar transaction, remain outstanding and shall thereafter, in lieu of or in
addition to (as the case may be) the number of Warrant Shares then exercisable under this Warrant, be exercisable for the kind
and number of shares of stock or other securities or assets of the Company or of the successor Person resulting from such transaction
to which the Holder would have been entitled upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale or similar
transaction if the Holder had exercised this Warrant in full immediately prior to the time of such reorganization, reclassification,
consolidation, merger, sale or similar transaction and acquired the applicable number of Warrant Shares then issuable hereunder
as a result of such exercise (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the exercisability of this Warrant);
and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (in form and substance satisfactory to the Holder and the Board;  provided , that
if the Board and the Holder are unable to agree on such adjustment within a reasonable period of time (not to exceed twenty (20)
days from the Holder's receipt of a certificate of adjustment pursuant to Section 5(f)(i)), such adjustment shall be determined
by a nationally recognized investment banking, accounting or valuation firm jointly selected by the Board and the Holder, the determination
of such firm shall be final and conclusive, and the fees and expenses of such valuation firm shall be borne by the 

12  

Company) shall
be made with respect to the Holder's rights under this Warrant to insure that the provisions of this  Section 5  hereof shall
thereafter be applicable, as nearly as possible, to this Warrant in relation to any shares of stock, securities or assets thereafter
acquirable upon exercise of this Warrant (including, in the case of any consolidation, merger, sale or similar transaction in which
the successor or purchasing Person is a Person other than the Company, an immediate adjustment in the Exercise Price reflected
by the terms of such consolidation, merger, sale or similar transaction, and a corresponding immediate adjustment to the number
of Warrant Shares acquirable upon exercise of this Warrant without regard to any limitations or restrictions on exercise, if the
value so reflected is less than the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such consolidation, merger, sale or similar transaction).
The provisions of this  Section 5(d)  shall similarly apply to successive reorganizations, reclassifications, consolidations,
mergers, sales or similar transactions. The Company shall not effect any such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation,
merger, sale or similar transaction unless, prior to the consummation thereof, the successor Person (if other than the Company)
resulting from such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale or similar transaction, shall assume, by written
instrument substantially similar in form and substance to this Warrant and satisfactory to the Holder, the obligation to deliver
to the Holder such shares of stock, securities or assets which, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, such Holder shall
be entitled to receive upon exercise of this Warrant. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, with respect to
any corporate event or other transaction contemplated by the provisions of this  Section 5(d) , the Holder shall have the
right to elect prior to the consummation of such event or transaction, to give effect to the exercise or sale rights contained
in this Warrant instead of giving effect to the provisions contained in this  Section 5(d)  with respect to this Warrant. 

 (e)               
  Certain Events . If any event of the type contemplated by the provisions of this  Section 5  but not expressly
provided for by such provisions (including, without limitation, the granting of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock rights
or other rights with equity features) occurs, then the Board and the Holder shall jointly make an appropriate adjustment in the
number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant so as to protect the rights of the Holder in a manner consistent
with the provisions of this  Section 5 ;  provided ,  further , that if the Board and the Holder are unable to agree
on such adjustment within a reasonable period of time (not to exceed twenty (20) days from the Holder s receipt of a certificate
of adjustment pursuant to  Section 5(f)(i) ) such adjustment shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking,
accounting or valuation firm jointly selected by the Board and the Holder. The determination of such firm shall be final and conclusive,
and the fees and expenses of such valuation firm shall be borne jointly by the Holder and the Company. 
 
        13  

(f)                
  Certificate as to Adjustment . 

 (i)                 
 As promptly as reasonably practicable following any adjustment of the number of Warrant Shares pursuant to the provisions
of this  Section 5 , but in any event not later than ten (10) Business Days thereafter, the Company shall furnish to the Holder
a certificate of an executive officer setting forth in reasonable detail such adjustment and the facts upon which it is based and
certifying the calculation thereof. 

 (ii)              
 As promptly as reasonably practicable following the receipt by the Company of a written request by the Holder, but in any
event not later than ten (10) Business Days thereafter and no more often than twice in any twelve-month period, the Company shall
furnish to the Holder a certificate of an executive officer certifying the number of Warrant Shares or the amount, if any, of other
shares of stock, securities or assets then issuable upon exercise of the Warrant. 

 (g)               
  Notices . In the event: 

 (i)                 
 that the Company shall take a record of the holders of its Common Stock (or other capital stock or securities at the time
issuable upon exercise of the Warrant) for the purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any dividend or other distribution,
to vote at a meeting (or by written consent), to receive any right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock of
any class or any other securities, or to receive any other security; or 

 (ii)              
 of any capital reorganization of the Company, any reclassification of the Common Stock of the Company, any consolidation
or merger of the Company with or into another Person, or sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets to another Person;
or 

 (iii)            
 of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company; 

 then, and in each such case, the Company shall send
or cause to be sent to the Holder at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the applicable record date or the applicable expected
effective date, as the case may be, for the event, a written notice specifying, as the case may be, (A) the record date for such
dividend, distribution, meeting or consent or other right or action, and a description of such dividend, distribution or other
right or action to be taken at such meeting or by written consent, or (B) the effective date on which such reorganization, reclassification,
consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is proposed to take place, and the date, if any is to be fixed,
as of which the books of the Company shall close or a record shall be taken with respect to which the holders of record of Common
Stock (or such other capital stock or securities at the time issuable upon exercise of the Warrant) shall be entitled to exchange
their shares of  

14  

Common Stock (or such other capital stock or securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such
reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, and the amount per share
and character of such exchange applicable to the Warrant and the Warrant Shares. 

  6.                  
   Transfer of Warrant . This Warrant and the rights hereunder may not be transferred by the Holder without the consent
of the Board, except that this Warrant and all rights hereunder are transferable, in whole or in part, by the Holder to its affiliates,
Persons, such as Medley Capital Corporation and Business Development Corporation of America, listed on  Schedule 6  or any
direct or indirect equityholder or lender of the Holder or their respective affiliates (collectively, the   Permitted Transferees  );
 provided , however, that such Permitted Transferees may not transfer this Warrant to any Person that is not a Permitted Transferee
without Board approval. Any transfer made in violation of the terms hereof shall be void ab initio .  

 7.                  
  Holder Not Deemed a Stockholder . Prior to the issuance to the Holder of the Warrant Shares to which the Holder is
then entitled to receive upon the due exercise of this Warrant, the Holder shall not be entitled to vote or receive dividends or
be deemed the holder of shares of capital stock of the Company for any purpose, nor shall anything contained in this Warrant be
construed to confer upon the Holder, as such, any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company or any right to vote, give or withhold
consent to any corporate action (whether any reorganization, issue of stock, reclassification of stock, consolidation, merger,
conveyance or otherwise), receive notice of meetings, receive dividends or subscription rights, or otherwise. In addition, nothing
contained in this Warrant shall be construed as imposing any liabilities on the Holder to purchase any securities (upon exercise
of this Warrant or otherwise) or as a stockholder of the Company, whether such liabilities are asserted by the Company or by creditors
of the Company. Notwithstanding this  Section 7 , the Company shall provide the Holder with copies of the same notices and
other information given to the stockholders of the Company generally, contemporaneously with the giving thereof to the stockholders;
provided, that the failure to provide such notice shall not effect any action taken by the stockholders of the Company. 

 8.                  
  Replacement on Loss . 

 (a)               
  Replacement of Warrant on Loss . Upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft,
destruction or mutilation of this Warrant and upon delivery of an indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it (it being understood
that a written indemnification agreement or affidavit of loss of the Holder shall be a sufficient indemnity) and, in case of mutilation,
upon surrender of such Warrant for cancellation to the Company, the Company at its own expense shall execute and deliver to the
Holder, in lieu hereof, a new Warrant (with the same terms) of like tenor and exercisable for an  

15

 THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED
HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AND HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT AND NOT WITH A VIEW TO,
OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE SALE OR DISTRIBUTION THEREOF. NO SUCH SALE OR DISTRIBUTION MAY BE EFFECTED WITHOUT AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION
STATEMENT RELATED THERETO OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL IN A FORM SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED

 Convertible Secured Promissory
Note 

For value received,
 MusclePharm Corporation  ,  a Nevada corporation (the   Company  )
promises to pay to  Ryan Drexler  or his assigns (the   Holder  ) the principal sum of  Eleven Million
Dollars  ($ 11,000,000.00) , together with interest on the outstanding principal amount at the rate of ten percent (10%)
per annum,   provided   that, upon and during the continuance of any Event of Default (as defined below), the rate of
interest shall increase to twelve percent (12%) per annum. Interest shall commence on the Issue Date (as defined below) and shall
continue and accrue daily at the applicable rate on the outstanding principal amount until paid in full or converted in accordance
with this note (the   Note  ). Interest shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days for the actual number
of days elapsed. Accrued and unpaid interest shall be paid by the Company to the Holder in cash on the Maturity Date,   provided  
that any interest not paid when due shall be capitalized and added to the principal amount of this Note and begin to bear interest
on the Maturity Date along with all other unpaid principal, capitalized interest and other capitalized obligations hereunder. The
 Issue Date  shall be the date on which the Holder remits to the Company or its designees the initial principal amount
of this Note. 

 This Note is secured
by a lien on and security interest in all of the assets and properties of the Company, as described in the Amended and Restated
Security Agreement of even date herewith by and between the Company and the Holder (the   Security Agreement  ). 

 WHEREAS, the Board
of Directors of the Company (the   Board  ) has considered the Settlement (as defined below) to address a significant,
outstanding contingent liability of the Company; and 

 WHEREAS, after considering
the terms of the Settlement and available alternatives to finance the Settlement, the Board has determined that the Settlement,
and the issuance and sale of this Note to fund the Settlement, are necessary and advisable to ensure the Company s ability
to operate as a going concern and thereby protect the interests of the Company and its stockholders; 
 
        1  

This Note is subject
to the following terms and conditions: 

 1.                  
  Maturity . 

 (a)               
  Repayment . Unless earlier converted or repaid (as applicable) as provided in Sections 1(b), 2 or 3, all
outstanding principal and any accrued but unpaid interest under this Note (whether or not that interest has been capitalized) (the
  Conversion Amount  ) shall be due and payable on November 8, 2017 (as such date may be accelerated, the   Maturity
Date  ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the option and upon the declaration of the Holder and upon written notice to
the Company, the entire Conversion Amount shall become due and payable upon an Event of Default. An   Event of Default  
shall occur if (i) the Company fails to pay any and all unpaid principal, accrued and unpaid interest and all other amounts owing
under the Note when due and payable pursuant to the terms of the Note,   provided, however  , that an Event of Default
shall not be deemed to have occurred on account of a failure to pay due solely to an administrative or operational error of any
depositary institution that is crediting by ACH or wiring such payment if the Company had the funds to make the payment when due
and payment is received by the Holder within two (2) business days following the Company s knowledge of such failure to pay;
(ii) the Company or any of its subsidiaries files any petition or action for relief under any bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency
or moratorium law or any other law for the relief of, or relating to, debtors, now or hereafter in effect, or makes any general
assignment for the benefit of creditors; (iii) an involuntary petition is filed against the Company or any of its subsidiaries
(unless such petition is dismissed or discharged within forty-five (45) days) under any bankruptcy statute or similar law now or
hereafter in effect, or a custodian, receiver, trustee, assignee for the benefit of creditors (or other similar official) is appointed
to take possession, custody or control of any property of the Company; or (iv) the Company breaches any other material term of
this Note or the Security Agreement (unless, in the case of any curable material breach, such material breach is cured within thirty
(30) days of the earlier of the date on which (x) the Holder has given notice of such breach to the Company and (y) the Company
has actual knowledge of such breach);   provided, however  , that all obligations under this Note, including without
limitation all principal and all accrued and unpaid interest, shall be accelerated, and shall be immediately and automatically
due and payable without any notice to the Company or other action, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default described in clause
(ii) or (iii) of this sentence. 

 (b)               
  Conversion . The Holder may at any time, and from time to time, in the sole discretion of the Holder, upon written
notice to the Company, elect to convert all or a portion of the Conversion Amount into shares of the Company s Common Stock,
$0.001 per share (  Common Stock  ), at a price per share equal to one dollar and eighty-three cents ($1.83),
rounded down to the nearest whole share. 

 (c)               
  Change of Control . The Company shall not enter into any agreement that would effect, and shall not effect, any Change
of Control (as defined below) unless the Company has provided the Holder with at least fifteen (15) days  advance written
notice of such Change of Control, including the anticipated consideration to be received by the holders of the Company s
Common Stock, and has otherwise provided the Holder with a meaningful opportunity to  

2  

exercise its conversion rights hereunder prior
to the consummation of such Change of Control; provided, that, the Holder shall maintain the confidentiality of any information
provided to it pursuant to this paragraph. The term   Change of Control   means (i) a sale of all or substantially
all of the Company s assets other than to an Excluded Entity (as defined below), (ii) a merger, consolidation or other capital
reorganization or business combination transaction of the Company with or into another corporation, limited liability company or
other entity other than an Excluded Entity, in each case pursuant to which the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to
such merger, consolidation or other capital reorganization or business combination transaction own less than fifty percent (50%)
of the voting interests in the surviving or resulting entity, or (iii) the consummation of a transaction, or series of related
transactions, in which any  person  (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the   Exchange Act  )) becomes the  beneficial owner  (as defined in Rule 13d-3
of the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of all of the Company s then outstanding voting capital stock. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, a transaction shall not constitute a Change of Control if its purpose is to (A) change the jurisdiction of the Company s
incorporation or (B) create a holding company that will be owned in substantially the same proportions by the persons who hold
the Company s voting capital stock immediately before such transaction. An   Excluded Entity   means a corporation
or other entity of which the holders of voting capital stock of the Company outstanding immediately prior to such transaction directly
or indirectly beneficially own voting capital stock representing at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by all of
such corporation s or other entity s voting securities outstanding immediately after such transaction. 

 2.                  
  Mechanics and Effect of Conversion.   

 (a)               
  Effectiveness of Conversion . Upon conversion of this Note, the Company will be forever released from all of its obligations
and liabilities under this Note with respect to that portion of the Conversion Amount being converted, including without limitation
the obligation to repay such portion of the principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest. Any interest accrued on the applicable
portion of the principal amount of this Note that is not simultaneously converted into Common Stock by reason of such conversion
shall be repaid upon demand by the Holder. Upon conversion of this Note, the Company shall take all such actions as are necessary
in order to ensure that the Common Stock issuable with respect to such conversion shall be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. 

 (b)               
  Issuance of Certificates . Upon conversion of this Note, the Holder shall surrender this Note, duly endorsed, at the
principal offices of the Company or any transfer agent of the Company. At its expense, the Company shall, as soon as practicable
thereafter, issue and deliver to such Holder, at such principal office, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares
of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled upon such conversion, together with any other securities and property to which
the Holder is entitled upon such conversion under the terms of this Note, including a check payable to the Holder for any cash
amounts payable as described herein. Upon any partial conversion of this Note, a new Note containing the same date and provisions
of this Note shall, at the request of the Holder, be issued by the Company to the Holder for the principal balance of this Note
and interest which shall not have been converted or paid. 
 
        3  

(c)               
  Fractional Shares . No fractional shares of the Company s Common Stock will be issued upon conversion of this
Note. If any fractional share of Common Stock would, except for the provisions hereof, be deliverable upon conversion of this Note,
the Company, in lieu of delivering such fractional share, shall pay an amount in cash equal to the value of such fractional share,
as determined by the per share conversion price used to effect such conversion. 

 3.                  
  Payment; Prepayment.  All payments shall be made in lawful money of the United States of America at such place as
the Holder hereof may from time to time designate in writing to the Company. Payment shall be credited first to any fees and expenses
due and payable hereunder, then to accrued and unpaid interest, and then the remainder shall be applied to principal. The Company
may prepay this Note in whole or in part at any time following at least fifteen (15) and no more than sixty (60) days  advance
written notice to the Holder,   provided   that the Holder shall retain all rights of conversion until the date of repayment,
notwithstanding the pendency of any prepayment notice. 

 4.                  
  Adjustment Provisions.  If after the Issue Date the Company shall make or issue, or shall fix a record date for the
determination of eligible holders of its capital stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable with respect
to the Common Stock that is payable in securities of the Company, assets (including cash), or rights or warrants to purchase shares
of Common Stock or securities convertible into shares of Common Stock (each, a   Dividend Event  ), and such dividend
or other distribution is actually made, then, and in each such case, the Holder, upon conversion of all or a portion of the Conversion
Amount into shares of Common Stock at any time after such Dividend Event, shall receive, in addition to the Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion of the Note, the securities or other assets, rights or warrants that would have been issuable to the Holder
had the Holder, immediately prior to such Dividend Event, converted such Conversion Amount into Common Stock. 

 5.                  
  Covenants.  

 (a)               
  Restrictions on Additional Indebtedness and Liens and Subordination . The Company may not incur or suffer to exist

Secured Promissory Note dated December 7, 2015, issued by the Company in favor of the Holder (the   Prior Note  );
(b) Indebtedness in respect of taxes, fees, assessments or other governmental charges or levies, either not delinquent or being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings;   provided  , that Company maintains adequate reserves therefor;
(c) Indebtedness existing as of the date hereof and set forth on the schedule of Permitted Indebtedness attached hereto, or pursuant

(i) are not past due or (ii) are being properly contested and for which the Company has established adequate reserves; (d) liens
consisting of deposits or pledges made in the ordinary course of business in connection with workers  compensation, unemployment
insurance, social security and similar laws; (e) liens on equipment (including capital leases) to secure purchase money Indebtedness
existing as of the date hereof, or any permitted refinancing thereof, so long as such security interests do not apply to any property
of the Company other than the equipment so acquired, and the Indebtedness secured thereby does not exceed the cost of such equipment,
and   provided   that any extension, renewal or replacement Lien shall be limited to the property encumbered by the existing
Lien and the principal amount of the Indebtedness being extended, renewed, or refinanced (as may have been reduced by any payment
thereon) does not increase; and (f) liens on accounts, inventory, machinery, equipment, instruments, documents, chattel paper,

 7.                  
  Governing Law.  This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York
(without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that would require application of the laws of another jurisdiction other

  Amendments and Waivers.  Any term of this Note may be amended only with the written consent of the Company and the

of this Note.

12.              
  Entire Agreement.  This Note, together with the Security Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between the Company
and the Holder pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and any and all other written or oral agreements existing between the Company
and the Holder are expressly canceled.

and all of which together will constitute a single agreement. 

 14.              
  Action to Collect on Note.  The Company promises to pay all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney s
fees, incurred in connection with the collection or enforcement of this Note or any obligation hereunder, including without limitation
during or in the context of any bankruptcy, receivership, trusteeship, reorganization or insolvency proceeding or other proceeding
under any other law for the relief of, or relating to, debtors, now or hereafter in effect, and all such amounts shall be payable
on demand (or, if the Holder is prevented by applicable law from making demand, as and when incurred by the Holder) and, if not
paid when due, shall be capitalized and become part of the principal amount of this Note, and interest shall accrue thereon as
set forth for other principal amounts under this Note.

Rate  ). If the Holder shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be
applied to the principal amount remaining owed under this Note or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal amount, refunded to the
Company. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Holder exceeds the Maximum Rate, the Holder
may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (i) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium
rather than interest, (ii) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (iii) amortize, prorate, allocate and spread
in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of this Note. 

 17.

fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the Holder in connection with any claim, action, suit
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, before or by any court or any administrative or legislative
body or authority, in which the Holder is involved, as a party or otherwise, or with which the Holder may be threatened, arising
in connection with this Note, the Prior Note or the Security Agreement (each, an   Action  ), except to the extent
the same has been 

7  

finally adjudicated to constitute fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Holder or a breach by
the Holder of this Note, the Prior Note or the Security Agreement. Promptly after receipt by the Holder of notice of the commencement
or threatened commencement against it of any third party Action, the Holder will notify the Company. The Company will be entitled
to assume the defense of the Action unless the Holder shall have reasonably concluded that a conflict may exist between the Company
and the Holder in conducting the defense of the Action. If the Company assumes the defense of any Action in accordance with the
provisions of this Section, it will not be liable to the Holder for any legal or other expenses subsequently separately incurred
by the Holder in connection with the defense of such Action. The Company shall not be liable for any settlement of a third-party
Action effected without its written consent, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld.

  Severability . In the event that any provision of this Note is invalid or unenforceable under any applicable statute
or rule of law, then such provision shall be deemed inoperative to the extent that it may conflict therewith and shall be deemed
modified to conform with such statute or rule of law. Any such provision which may prove invalid or unenforceable under any law
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Note.

Security Agreement 

 This  Amended and Restated Security Agreement  (this
  Agreement  ), dated as of November 8, 2016, is entered into between  Ryan Drexler , an individual (  Grantee  ),
and  MusclePharm Corporation,  a Nevada corporation, as grantor (  Grantor  ). 

 Background 

 WHEREAS, Grantor and Grantee have entered into (i) a Convertible
Secured Promissory Note dated as of December 3, 2015 (as amended, restated, or otherwise modified from time to time, the   2015
Note  ) and (ii) a Convertible Secured Promissory Note dated as of November 8, 2016 (as amended, restated, or otherwise
modified from time to time, the   2016 Note  , and together with the 2015 Note, the   Notes  ); 

 WHEREAS, as a condition precedent to the advancement of
funds to Grantor under the 2015 Note, on December 3, 2015, Grantor entered into a Security Agreement with Grantee pursuant to which
Grantor granted the security interests contemplated by this Agreement as security for the Secured Obligations (as defined therein)
(the   Existing Security Agreement  ); 

 WHEREAS, as a condition precedent to the advancement of
funds to Grantor under the 2016 Note, the parties now desire to amend and restate the Existing Security Agreement to grant a further
security interest in respect of the obligations under the 2016 Note; 

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Grantor (the   Board  )
has considered the Settlement (as defined in the 2016 Note) to address a significant, outstanding contingent liability of Grantor;
and 

 WHEREAS, after considering the terms of the Settlement
and available alternatives to finance the Settlement, the Board has determined that the Settlement, the issuance and sale of the
2016 Note to fund the Settlement and the entry into this Agreement to secure the 2016 Note are necessary and advisable to ensure
Grantor s ability to operate as a going concern and thereby protect the interests of Grantor and its stockholders.

or a breach by Grantee of the Notes or this Agreement.  Promptly after receipt by  Grantee
 of notice of the commencement or threatened commencement against it of any third party Action,

to Grantee for any legal or other expenses subsequently separately incurred by Grantee in connection with the defense of such Action.
Grantor shall not be liable for any settlement of a third-party Action effected without its written consent, which consent may
not be unreasonably withheld.

internal control over financial reporting.
