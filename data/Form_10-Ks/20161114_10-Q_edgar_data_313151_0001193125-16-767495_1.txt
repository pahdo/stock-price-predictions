    SADDLEBROOK RESORTS, INC.  
 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
 (Unaudited)    Note 1. Basis of Presentation  
 Saddlebrook Resorts, Inc. (the  Company ) developed and operates Saddlebrook Resort, which is a condominium hotel and resort located in Wesley
Chapel, Florida.    The Company s accompanying balance sheet for September 30, 2016, and its statements of operations and accumulated earnings and cash
flows for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, are unaudited but reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for the fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented.
All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited financial statements as of that date.  
 The Company s business is seasonal. Therefore, the results of operations for the interim periods shown in this report are not necessarily indicative of
results to be expected for future interim periods or the full fiscal year.    These financial statements and related notes are presented for interim periods
in accordance with the requirements of Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X, and, consequently, do not include all disclosures normally required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Accordingly, these financial
statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
 Note 2. Accounts Receivable      
   Note 3. Property, Buildings and Equipment      
   The Company s property, buildings and equipment are pledged as security for its long-term debt (see Note 4).

  Note 4. Long-term debt and Capital Lease Obligation  
 On December 6, 2015, the Company s financing agreement with a third party lender was modified to include renewal for the existing principal balance of
$4,875,000, along with an advance of an additional $2,000,000. The new term note expires December 6, 2020. At September 30, 2016, $6,610,576 was outstanding under the note. The term note requires monthly principle payments of $29,380 plus interest
of 3% over the one month Libor index (3.52% at September 30, 2016). The term note is collateralized by all current and subsequently acquired real and personal property. The term note requires the Company to maintain a Debt Ratio, as defined, of
1.25%.    In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs , which requires debt issuance costs
related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. ASU 2015-03 required retrospective adoption and became effective with
respect to the Company s financial statements on January 1, 2016. Prior to the effective date, such issuance costs were classified as assets and included as deferred charges, net, in the Company s balance sheet. Under the provisions of ASU
2015-03, such issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt in the accompanying September 30, 2016 balance sheet, and have been reclassified in the December 31, 2015 balance sheet to conform to the
2016 presentation.   On December 13, 2012, the Company entered into a capital lease obligation for equipment in the amount of $80,479. The capital lease is
secured by the equipment purchased, matures in November 2017 and requires monthly payments of $1,426, including interest at 2.44%. At September 30, 2016, the amount due on this capital lease obligation was $19,663.  
 On December 2, 2012, the Company entered into a capital lease obligation for equipment in the amount of $255,874. The assets associated with this lease cost
$294,724, of which $38,850 was reduced through the Company s trade-in of existing equipment. This capital lease is secured by the equipment purchased, matures in December 2017 and requires monthly payments of $4,995, including interest at
6.41%, beginning in January 2013. At September 30, 2016, the amount due on this capital lease obligation was $71,824.    On January 15, 2014, the Company
entered into a capital lease obligation for equipment in the amount of $150,000. The capital lease is secured by equipment purchased, matures in December 2018 and requires monthly payments of $3,024 including interest of 7.75%. At September 30,
2016, the amount due on this capital lease obligation was $72,153.    On January 15, 2014, the Company entered into a capital lease obligation for equipment
in the amount of $102,000. The capital lease is secured by equipment purchased, matures in December 2018 and requires monthly payments of $2,233, including interest an 11.30%. At September 30, 2016, the amount due on this capital lease obligation
was $53,023.

    SADDLEBROOK RENTAL POOL OPERATION  
 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
 (Unaudited)    Note 1. Rental Pool Operations and
Rental Pool Agreement    Condominium units are provided as rental (hotel) accommodations by their owners under the Rental Pool and Agency Appointment
Agreement (the  Agreement ) with Saddlebrook Resorts, Inc. (collectively, the  Rental Pool ). Saddlebrook Resorts, Inc. ( Saddlebrook ) acts as operator of the Rental Pool which provides for the distribution of a
percentage of net rental income, as defined, to the owners.    The Saddlebrook Rental Pool Operation consists of two funds: the Rental Pool Income
Distribution Fund ( Distribution Fund ) and the Maintenance and Furniture Replacement Escrow Fund ( Maintenance Escrow Fund ). The operations of the Distribution Fund reflect the earnings of the Rental Pool. The Distribution Fund
balance sheets reflect amounts due from Saddlebrook for the rental pool distribution payable to participants and amounts due to the Maintenance Escrow fund. The amounts due from Saddlebrook are required to be distributed no later than forty-five
days following the end of each calendar quarter. The Maintenance Escrow Fund reflects the accounting for escrowed assets used to maintain unit interiors and replace furniture as it becomes necessary.  
 Rental pool participants and Saddlebrook share rental revenues according to the provisions of the Agreement. Net Rental Income shared consists of rentals
received less a marketing surcharge of 7.5%, a 12.5% management fee, travel agent commissions, credit card expenses and provision for bad debts, if warranted. Saddlebrook receives 45% of Net Rental Income as operator of the Rental Pool. The
remaining 55% of Net Rental Income, after adjustments for complimentary room revenues (ten percent of the normal unit rental price paid by Saddlebrook for promotional use of the unit) and certain minor repair and maintenance charges, is available
for distribution to the participants and Maintenance Escrow Fund based upon each participant s respective participation factor (computed using the value of a furnished unit and the number of days it was available to the pool). Quarterly, 45% of
Net Rental Income is distributed to participants and 10%, as adjusted for complimentary room revenues and minor interior maintenance and replacement charges, is deposited in an escrow account until a maximum of 20% of the set value of the individual
owner s furniture package has been accumulated. Excess escrow balances are refunded to participants.    Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies    Basis of Accounting    The accounting records of the
funds are maintained on the accrual basis of accounting.    Income Taxes  
 No federal or state taxes have been reflected in the accompanying financial statements as the tax effect of fund activities accrues to the rental pool
participants and Saddlebrook.

    Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations    General    The Company operates
Saddlebrook Resort (the  Resort ) in Wesley Chapel, Florida, which contains condominium units that have been sold to third parties or to affiliates of the Company. The majority of the condominium units are hotel accommodations that
participate in a rental-pooling program that provides its owners with a percentage distribution of related room revenues minus certain fees and expenses. The remainder of the condominium units participate in a non-pooling rental program, are
owner-occupied or are designated as hospitality suites or housing for young athletes independent of the rental programs. Other resort property owned by the Company and its affiliates include golf courses, tennis courts, a spa, restaurants and
conference center facilities.    Results of Operations  
 Third quarter 2016 compared to third quarter 2015    The
Company s total revenues increased approximately $963,000, or about 28%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. Total revenues for the Rental Pool increased approximately $235,000, or about
34%. Revenue increase is due to an increase in group occupancy over the same period last year of 1,492 unit nights, or about 63%. The Company is seeing increased spending by groups in food and beverage, golf and other revenue areas. Contributing to
the profit for the 3rd quarter ended September 30, 2016 was a payment to the Company of $397,488 for a claim related to the BP oil spill. This amount was recorded as Other Income during the period.  
 Total costs and expenses increased approximately $611,000, or about 11%, for the Company, and $109,000, or about 60%, for the Rental Pool
Operation. These increases are directly related to the increase in group occupancy.    The Company experienced a net loss for the quarter in the amount
of approximately $1,578,000, compared to a net loss of approximately $2,308,000 in the prior comparable quarter, and improvement of about 32%. Amounts available for distribution for the Rental Pool Operation increased approximately $79,000, or about
36%, from the comparable period last year.    First nine months 2016 compared to first nine months 2015  
 The Company s total revenues decreased approximately $30,000, less and 1%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the
prior year. The total revenues for the Rental Pool decreased approximately $320,000, or about 5%.    Total costs and expenses for the Company increased
approximately $1,002,000 or 4%. Total costs and expenses for the Rental Pool Operation decreased by about $80,000, about 4%.    The Company had a net income
for the period of approximately $108,000, compared with net income of approximately $843,000 in the comparable period last year. Amounts available for distribution for the Rental Pool Operation decreased approximately $113,000, or about 4%, over the
same period in the prior year.

  Impact of Current Economic Conditions  
 The Company expects to see a strong increase in occupancy for the balance of 2016. The Company believes that businesses have begun to alter their spending
patterns and that this is a result of a turnaround in the economy.    The Company has increased its sales force to focus more in the area of corporate
meetings. The Company continues its marketing efforts toward the social clientele by developing packages designed to target more social guests, including families. These social packages are being promoted through the Company s website as well
as through travel wholesalers and with emphasis on e-commerce sites. Management has implemented programs and measures to help the Company get back to positive operating income. These programs and measures include cost control programs, consolidation
of restaurant operations and efforts to increase brand awareness and recognition of the Resort.    Liquidity and Capital Resources  
 Net income for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was $108,000. Excluding non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization of $1,454,000,
the Company s actual operating cash flow was $1,158,000.    Future operating costs and planned expenditures for minor capital additions and
improvements are expected to be adequately funded by the Company and its affiliates  current cash reserves and cash generated by the Resort s operations.  
 On December 6, 2015, the Company s financing agreement with a third party lender was modified to include renewal for the existing principal balance of
$4,875,000, along with an advance of an additional $2,000,000. The new term note expires December 6, 2020. At September 30, 2016, $6,610,576 was outstanding under the note. The term note requires monthly principle payments of $29,380 plus interest
of 3% over the one month Libor index (3.52% at September 30, 2016). The term note is collateralized by all current and subsequently acquired real and personal property. The term note requires the Company to maintain a Debt Ratio, as defined, of
1.25%.    The Company s ultimate shareholder has the financial ability and intent to continue to fund operations through affiliated companies that are
100% owned by the Company s ultimate shareholder to the extent required to support the Company s operations. The    Company has loans outstanding
to the affiliated companies of approximately $10.1 million at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. In addition to the shareholders  financial ability these affiliated Companies are expected to continue to generate positive cash
flows from operations during fiscal year 2016 should additional funding be required to support the Company s operations.    The Company s
operation of the Resort is not considered to be dependent on any individual or small group of customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the Company s business or financial condition.  
 Seasonality    The Company s operations are
seasonal with the highest volume of revenue generally occurring in the first quarter of each calendar year.    Due to the seasonal business of the Company,
the results of operations for the interim period shown in this report are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full fiscal year.

    Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  
 The Company s invested cash is subject to changes in market interest rates. Otherwise, the Company does not have significant market risk with respect to
foreign currency exchanges or other market rates.    The Company s term note bears interest at 3.0% over the one month LIBOR index and matures in
December 2020.      Item 4. Controls and Procedures  
 The Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016, pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 15d-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the
Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016 in timely alerting them to material information required to be included in the Company s periodic SEC filings.  
 The Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures
over internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of
a control system must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitation in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues within the Company have been detected.  
 There were no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 that materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting.     
 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION      Item 1. Legal Proceedings  
 The Company is from time to time involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of the Company s management, insurance or
indemnification from other third parties adequately covers these matters. Accordingly, the effect, if any, of these claims is considered immaterial to the Company s financial condition and results of operations.
