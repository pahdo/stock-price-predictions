  Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements

1.  
      Nature of Business and Continuance of Operations   

Longbau Group, Inc. (the  Company ) was
incorporated in the State of Delaware on December 23, 2013. The Company owns 100% of Longbau Group Limited, which was incorporated
in Hong Kong on February 14, 2014. The Company is focusing its business on consultancy for deferred preneed funeral and cemetery
receipts held in trust, preneed cemetery activities, preneed funeral activities, preneed funeral and cemetery, burial vaults,
cemetery property, and cemetery property revenue. 

In September 2014, the Company established Longbau
Management Consulting LLC ( Longbau Taiwan ) in Taiwan to provide end-of-life consulting service and sell end-of-life
products in Taiwan. Longbau Taiwan is 100% owned by Longbau Group Limited. In 2015, the Company started to sell supplies for funerals
and plans to add additional funeral services for the Taiwanese market. 

2. 
      Going Concern   

The Company had suffered recurring losses from operations
and has limited recurring source of revenues that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The
Company s management is planning to obtain financing either through the issuance of equity or debt instruments. To the extent
that funds generated from any private placements, public offerings, and/or bank financings are insufficient, the Company will
have to raise additional working capital through other sources. The financial statements are presented on a going concern basis,
which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of the recorded assets or the classification of liabilities that
may be necessary should it be determined that we are unable to continue as a going concern. 

3.  
      Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

a)  
      Basis of Presentation   

The accompanying interim unaudited consolidated financial
statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information, and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) with respect to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include
all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The interim unaudited consolidated
financial statements furnished reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) which are, in the opinion
of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. Interim results are not necessarily
indicative of the results for the full year. These interim unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2015 and notes thereto contained elsewhere
in the Registration Statement on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 14, 2016. 

b)  
      Use of Estimates   

The preparation of consolidated financial statements
in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions
related to deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical
experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are
not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from
the Company s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future
results of operations will be affected. 

c)  
      Principles of Consolidation   

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Longbau Group, Inc and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Longbau Group Limited and Longbau Taiwan. All significant
intercompany transactions and balances were eliminated in consolidation. 

d)  
      Foreign Currency   

Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies
are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange
prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are charged or credited to other comprehensive
loss. 

e)  
      Cash and Cash Equivalent   

The Company considers all highly liquid short-term
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. These investments are carried
at cost, which approximates fair value. 

f)  
      Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   

The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our
best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. The Company determines the allowance based on known
troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. 

g)  
      Property and Equipment   

Property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated
using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the lease term, ranging from 3 to 5 years.
Computer software developed or obtained for internal use is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
life of the software, generally 3 years. Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. 

h)  
      Income Taxes   

An asset and liability approach is used for financial
accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between income tax and financial
reporting and principally relate to recognition of revenue and expenses in different periods for financial and tax accounting
purposes and are measured using currently enacted tax rates and laws. In addition, a deferred tax asset can be generated by net
operating loss carry forwards. If it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized,
a valuation allowance is recognized. 

i)  
      Revenue Recognition   

Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of
an arrangement exists, service has provided or good has been delivered, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is
probable. 

j)  
      Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share ( EPS )   

Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income available
to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted
EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible
preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing Diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining
the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive
potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. There were no potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

k)  
      Subsequent Events   

The Company s management reviewed all material
events from September 30, 2016 through the issuance date of these financial statements for disclosure consideration. 

l)  
      New Accounting Pronouncements   

In February 2016, a pronouncement was issued that
creates new accounting and reporting guidelines for leasing arrangements. The new guidance requires organizations that lease assets
to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet related to the rights and obligations created by those leases, regardless
of whether they are classified as finance or operating leases. Consistent with current guidance, the recognition, measurement,
and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating
lease. The guidance also requires new disclosures to help financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and
uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, with early application permitted. The new standard is to be
applied using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on its
consolidated financial statements. 

The Company does not believe that any other recently
issued effective pronouncements, or pronouncements issued but not yet effective, if adopted, would have a material effect on the
accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

In January 2016, the board of directors agreed to
pursue a merger with two Taiwanese companies related to the Company s Chief Executive Officer and the Company paid approximately
$62,000 (NT$2,000,000) as earnest money for the merger. Because the parties couldn t reach an agreement on the terms, the
deposit was refunded to the Company in April 2016. As the date of this report, the Company is still negotiating with these two
companies. 

5.  
      Related Party Transactions   

Salary  

The Company entered into employment agreements with
certain shareholders on February 15, 2014 and agreed to pay these shareholders a total compensation of $6,000 per month. The agreements
ended on February 15, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded salary expense of $0 and
$9,000, respectively, to these shareholders. 

Office Leases  

In September 2014, the Company entered into a one-year
lease agreement with its Chief Executive Officer for leasing an office in Taiwan. The Company agreed to pay approximately $30
(NT$1,000) per month to the officer. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded rent expense of $194.
As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had accrued rent expense of $254 and $244, respectively. 

In July 2015, the Company entered into three lease
agreements with its officers for leasing offices in Taiwan. The agreements will expire in July 2018 and the Company agreed to
pay a deposit of approximately $6,600 (NT$207,500) and rent of approximately $3,100 (NT$103,750) per month to the officers. For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded and paid rent expenses of approximately $28,820 (NT$933,750)
and $9,900 (NT$311,250), respectively. 

Future minimum lease payments, converted to U.S.
dollars using foreign exchange rate at September 30, 2016, for operating leases as of September 30, 2016 are as follows: 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Overview  

We are a start-up company actively pursuing a business plan.
We do not have significant revenue. We have some minimal assets and have incurred losses since inception. We sell death care management
consultant services through Longbau Hong Kong, our operating company in Hong Kong, to public consumers across Taiwan. In
September 2014, we established another subsidiary in Taiwan, Longbau Taiwan, to provide end-of-life consulting service and sell
end-of-life products across Taiwan. Longbau Taiwan is 100% owned by Longbau Hong Kong. 

We will be providing a variety of end-of-life management consultancy
services. We consult on the purchase of cemetery property and funeral and cemetery merchandise and services at the time of need
and on a preneed basis. In addition, the Company specializes in the consultancy for deferred preneed funeral and cemetery receipts
held in trust, preneed cemetery activities, preneed funeral activities, preneed funeral and cemetery, burial vaults, cemetery
property, and cemetery property revenue. 

In March 2014, we entered into two end-of-life consulting agreements
which provided monthly revenues of approximately $8,000. The obligations under these agreements concluded in March 2015. 

In July 2015, the Company added two new offices in Kaohsiung
city and Changhua city and expanded its office by taking more space in Taichung office. The Company also added a total of 14 employees
(including managers and staff) during the month of July. The Company has started to sell supplies for funerals and plans to add
additional funeral services for the Taiwanese market in 2015. 

Other than the organic growth, we are also looking to acquire
businesses in the death care service industry and other related areas. 

In January 2016, the board of directors agreed to pursue a
merger with two Taiwanese companies related to the Company s Chief Executive Officer. As the date of this report, the Company
is still negotiating with these two companies. 

Going Concern  

As of September 30, 2016, the Company has limited recurring
sources of revenue and has an accumulated loss of $376,065 since inception. Our operation is dependent on funding from our shareholders
and officers. The Company expects to incur additional losses in the immediate future due to the start-up nature. These factors
raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

You should read this Management s Discussion and Analysis
in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Related Notes. This discussion contains forward-looking statements
that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking
statements. 

Results of Operations   

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenues   For the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, we had revenues of $0 and $114,528, respectively. In March 2014, we entered into two end-of-life consulting
agreements which provided monthly revenues of approximately $8,000. The agreements ended in March 2015. In addition, we sold end-of-life
products of approximately $90,000 in August 2015. We had no revenue in 2016. 

Cost of revenues   For the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, we had cost of revenues of $0 and $24,338, respectively. The cost was for the death products sold in August
2015. 

General and administrative expenses   For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had general and administrative expenses of $135,296 and $186,600, respectively. The
decrease mainly due to the decrease of professional fees and office equipment of approximately $16,000 and $51,000, respectively,
partially offset by the increase in rent expense of approximately $18,000. 

Net loss   For the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, our net loss was $136,137 and $97,209, respectively. The increase was mainly due to the decrease in revenues. 

4   

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenues   For the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, we had revenues of $0 and $97,028, respectively. We sold end-of-life products of approximately $90,000 in August
2015. We had no revenue in 2016.     

Cost of revenues  
For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had cost of revenues of $0 and $24,338, respectively. The cost was
related to   end-of-life products we sold in August 2015.  

General and administrative expenses   For the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had general and administrative expenses of $50,290 and $45,669, respectively. 

Net loss   For the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, our net loss was $50,563 and $25,991, respectively. The increase was mainly due to the decrease in revenues. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

As of September 30, 2016, we had cash on hand of $16,672. 

We used $65,271 and $33,264 net cash in our operations for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We used cash in general and administrative activities to expand
our business. 

In January 2016, the board of directors agreed to pursue an
merger with two Taiwanese companies related to the Company s Chief Executive Officer and the Company paid approximately
$62,000 (NT$2,000,000) as earnest money for the merger. Because the parties couldn t reach an agreement on the terms, the
deposit was refunded to the Company in April 2016. 

We plan to fund our operations from loans from our major shareholders
and we also plan to raise equity capital by offering shares of our common stock to investors. If financing is needed and
we are not able to raise the capital necessary to fund our business expansion objectives, we may have to delay the implementation
of our business plan. 

The estimated budget of our operating expenses for the next
twelve months is as follows: 

We do not currently have any arrangements for financing. Obtaining
additional funding will be subject to a number of factors, including general market conditions, investor acceptance of our business
plan and initial results from our business operations. These factors may impact the timing, amount, terms or conditions of additional
financing available to us. The most likely source of future funds available to us is through the sale of additional shares of
common stock or advances from our major shareholders or directors and, if we are able to obtain equity financing, it will likely
result in significant additional dilution to the interests of our current stockholders and may include liquidation or other preferences
that adversely affect your right as a stockholder. The Company may obtain financing by issuing debt which may involve agreements
that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making
capital expenditures or declaring dividends. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such additional financing
is needed and if we cannot receive such financing we may be forced to suspend or cease operations.

Critical Accounting Policies   

Our financial statements and related public financial information
are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( US GAAP ). US GAAP requires
the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained
in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our use of
estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates
on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results
may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates
made during the preparation of our financial statements. 

We believe the following is among the most critical accounting
policies that impact our consolidated financial statements. We suggest that our significant accounting policies, as described
in our financial statements in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, be read in conjunction with this Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions
related to deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical
experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are
not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from
the Company s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future
results of operations will be affected. 

Revenue Recognition  

Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, service has provided or good has been delivered, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is probable.    

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

The Company does not expect adoption of the new accounting
pronouncements will have a material effect on the Company s financial statements. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

None.

ITEM 4. INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act of 1934 are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the
reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have reviewed the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016 and, based on their evaluation, have concluded that the disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective. 

Management s assessment identified several material weaknesses
in our internal control over financial reporting. A  material weakness  is defined under SEC rules as a deficiency,
or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that
a material misstatement of a company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis by the company s internal controls. Our management concluded that we had material weaknesses in our control environment
and financial reporting process consisting of the following as of the evaluation date: 

1)  
      lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority
    of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board of Directors, resulting in ineffective oversight
    in the establishment and monitoring of required internal control and procedures; and   

2)  
      ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and
    reporting processes.   

Changes in internal control over financial reporting   

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, there were
no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation performed during the
fiscal quarter covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal
control over financial reporting.
