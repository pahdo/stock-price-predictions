        S  PECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  
   
 When included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or in other documents that Investar Holding Corporation (the  Company ) files with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) or in statements made by or on behalf of the Company, words like  may,   should,   could,   predict,   potential,   believe,   think,   will likely result,   expect,   continue,   will,   anticipate,   seek,   estimate,   intend,   plan,   projection,   would,   outlook  and similar expressions or the negative version of those words are intended to identify forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described therein. The Company s forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and estimates that management believes to be reasonable in light of the information available at the time such statements are made. However, many of the matters addressed by these statements are inherently uncertain and could be affected by many factors beyond management s control. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. These   factors   include,   but   are   not   limi t ed   to,   the   fol l ow i ng,   any   one   or   more of which   co u  l d mater i ally affect t h e   o u t c ome of future   events:

 Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, you should not rely on any forward-looking statement as a prediction of future events.

        NO  TE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
 Basis of Presentation  
 The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Investar Holding Corporation (the  Company ) have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include information or footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with GAAP. However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the financial statements have been included. The results of operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year. These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, including the notes thereto, which were included as part of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 11, 2016.  
 Nature of Operations  
 Investar Holding Corporation, headquartered in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, provides full banking services, excluding trust services, through its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Investar Bank (the  Bank ), a Louisiana-chartered bank. The Company s primary market is South Louisiana. The Company currently operates 10 full service banking offices located throughout its market and had 155 employees at September 30, 2016.  
 Principles of Consolidation  
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  
 Use of Estimates  
 The preparation of statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences could be material.  
 Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses. While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in local economic conditions. In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company s allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Because of these factors, it is reasonably possible that the allowance for loan losses may change materially in the near term. However, the amount of the change that is reasonably possible cannot be estimated.  
 Other estimates that are susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of other-than-temporary impairments of securities and the fair value of financial instruments.  
 Reclassifications 
 Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2015 financial statements to be consistent with the 2016 presentation.  
 Concentrations of Credit Risk  
 The Company s loan portfolio consists of the various types of loans described in Note 4, Loans. Real estate or other assets secure most loans. The majority of loans have been made to individuals and businesses in the Company s market of South Louisiana. Customers are dependent on the condition of the local economy for their livelihoods and servicing their loan obligations. The Company does not have any significant concentrations in any one industry or individual customer.

    Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
   
 FASB ASC Topic 230  Statement of Cash Flows   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  Update No. 2016-15.  The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-15 in August 2016. The amendments in the Update address eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice, as the issues are either unclear or do not have specific guidance under current GAAP. ASU 2016-15 will be effective on January 1, 2018. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position.  
   
 FASB ASC Topic 326  Financial Instruments   Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  Update No. 2016-13.  The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-13 in June 2016. The revised accounting guidance requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts and requires enhanced disclosures related to the significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an organization s portfolio. In addition, ASU 2016-13 amends the accounting for credit losses of available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. ASU 2016-13 will be effective on January 1, 2020. Management is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-13 on the consolidated financial statements.  
   
 FASB ASC Topic 718  Compensation   Stock Compensation  Update No. 2016-09.   The Financial Accounting and Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Update No. 2016-09 in March 2016 as part of its simplification initiative. The areas for simplification in this Update involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments in the Update are effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position.   
   
 FASB ASC Topic 323  Investments   Equity Method and Joint Ventures  Update No. 2016-07.   The FASB issued Update No. 2016-07 in March 2016 as part of its simplification initiative. The amendments in the Update eliminate the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The amendments require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. In addition, the amendments in this Update require that an entity that has an equity security classified as available for sale that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting recognize through earnings the unrealized holding gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for use of the equity method. The amendments in the Update are effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position.  
   
 FASB ASC Topic 825  Financial Instruments - Overall  Update No. 2016-01.   The FASB issued Update No. 2016-01 in January 2016 to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The main provisions require investments in equity securities to be measured at fair value through net income, unless they qualify for a practicability exception, and require fair value changes arising from changes in instrument-specific credit risk for financial liabilities that are measured under the fair value option to be recognized in other comprehensive income. The amendments in the Update are effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position.

    The amortized cost and approximate fair value of investment securities classified as held to maturity are summarized below as of the dates presented (dollars in t  housands).   

Securities are classified in the consolidated balance sheets according to management s intent. The Company had no securities classified as trading as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.  
 The aggregate fair values and aggregate unrealized losses on securities whose fair values are below book values are summarized in the tables below. Due to the nature of the investment and current market prices, these unrealized losses are considered a temporary impairment of the securities.  
 The following table presents, by type and number of securities, the age of gross unrealized losses and approximate fair value by investment category for securities available for sale as of the dates presented (dollars in thousands).

 (Unaudited) 
   
    The following table presents, by type and number of securities, the age of gross unrealized losses and approximate fair value by investment category for securities held to maturity as of December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands). There were no held to matur  ity securities with gross unrealized losses at September 30, 2016.  

The unrealized losses in the Company s investment portfolio, caused by interest rate increases, are not credit issues and the Company does not intend to sell the securities. Furthermore, it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities before recovery of their amortized cost bases. The Company does not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.  
 The weighted average tax equivalent yield, amortized cost and approximate fair value of debt securities, by contractual maturity (including mortgage-backed securities), are shown below as of the dates presented. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties (dollars in thousands).

    NOTE 4. LOANS   
 The Company s loan portfolio, excluding loans held for sale, consists of the following categories of loans as of the dates presented (dollars in thousands).  

The table below provides an analysis of the aging of loans as of the dates presented (dollars in thousands). 

The balance of total loans at September 30, 2016 in the table above includes approximately $30.9 million of loans acquired in acquisitions ( acquired loans ) that were recorded at fair value as of the acquisition dates. Included in the acquired loan balances as of September 30, 2016 were approximately $0.6 million in nonaccrual loans.          
 The total December 31, 2015 balance in the table above includes approximately $37.0 million of acquired loans that were recorded at fair value as of the acquisition dates. Included in the acquired loan balances as of December 31, 2015 were approximately $0.2 million in loans 30-59 days past due and $1.1 million in nonaccrual loans.

 INVESTAR HOLDING CORPORATION 
     NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

    Credit Quality Indicators   
 Loans are categorized into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt, such as current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The following definitions are utilized for risk ratings, which are consistent with the definitions used in supervisory guidance:  
 Pass    Loans not meeting the criteria below are considered pass. These loans have the highest credit characteristics and financial strength. Borrowers possess characteristics that are highly profitable, with low to negligible leverage, and demonstrate significant net worth and liquidity.   
 Special Mention    Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the Company s credit position at some future date.   
 Substandard    Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.   
 Doubtful    Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.   
 Loss    Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as recorded assets is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the assets have absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off these assets.    
 The table below presents the Company s loan portfolio by category and credit quality indicator as of the dates presented (dollars in thousands).

 INVESTAR HOLDING CORPORATION 
     NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (Unaudited) 

The Company had no loans that were classified as doubtful or loss as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.  
 Loan participations and whole loans sold to and serviced for others are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The balances of the participations and whole loans sold were $298.5 million and $383.7 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The unpaid principal balances of these loans were approximately $340.6 million and $426.9 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
 In the ordinary course of business, the Company makes loans to its executive officers, principal stockholders, directors and to companies in which these individuals are principal owners. Loans outstanding to such borrowers (including companies in which they are principal owners) amounted to approximately $20.0 million and $18.0 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These loans are all current and performing according to the original terms. These loans were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not related to the Company or the Bank and did not involve more than normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features.  
 The table below shows the aggregate amount of loans to such related parties as of the dates presented (dollars in thousands). 

Loans Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality 
 The Company elected to account for certain loans acquired as acquired impaired loans under ASC 310-30 due to evidence of credit deterioration at acquisition and the probability that the Company will be unable to collect all contractually required payments.  
 The following table presents changes in the carrying value, net of allowance for loan losses, of acquired impaired loans, or loans accounted for under ASC 310-30, for the periods presented (dollars in thousands).

    Impaired Loans   
 The Company considers a loan to be impaired when, based on current information and events, the Company determines that it will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the loan agreement, including scheduled interest payments. Generally, those loans rated special mention or lower are evaluated for impairment each quarter. Determination of impairment is treated the same across all classes of loans. When the Company identifies a loan as impaired, it measures the impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, except when the sole (remaining) source of repayment for the loans is the operation or liquidation of the collateral. In these cases when foreclosure is probable, the Company uses the current fair value of the collateral, less selling costs, instead of discounted cash flows. If the Company determines that the value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan (net of previous charge-offs, deferred loan fees or costs and unamortized premium or discount), the Company recognizes impairment through an allowance estimate or a charge-off to the allowance for loan losses.  
 When the ultimate collectability of the total principal of an impaired loan is in doubt and the loan is on nonaccrual, all payments are applied to principal, under the cost recovery method. When the ultimate collectability of the total principal of an impaired loan is not in doubt and the loan is on nonaccrual, contractual interest is credited to interest income when received, under the cash basis method.  
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company was not committed to lend additional funds to any customer whose loan was classified as impaired. 
 The following tables include the recorded investment and unpaid principal balances for impaired loans with the associated allowance amount, if applicable, as of the dates indicated. The Company determined the specific allowance based on the present values of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, except when the remaining source of repayment for the loan is the operation or liquidation of the collateral. In those cases, the current fair value of the collateral, less estimated selling cost, was used to determine the specific allowance recorded (dollars in thousands).

Troubled Debt Restructurings  
 In situations where, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower s financial difficulties, the Company grants a concession for other than an insignificant period of time to the borrower that the Company would not otherwise consider, the related loan is classified as a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR ). The Company strives to identify borrowers in financial difficulty early and work with them to modify their loans to more affordable terms before such loans reach nonaccrual status. These modified terms may include rate reductions, principal forgiveness, payment forbearance and other actions intended to minimize the economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral. In cases in which the Company grants the borrower new terms that provide for a reduction of either interest or principal, the Company measures any impairment on the restructuring as previously noted for impaired loans.  
 Loans classified as TDRs, consisting of twenty credits, totaled approximately $2.7 million at September 30, 2016 compared to eleven credits totaling approximately $2.2 million at December 31, 2015. Eighteen of the twenty TDRs were acquired. Nine of the restructured loans were considered TDRs due to modification of terms through adjustments to maturity, nine restructured loans were considered TDRs due to a reduction in the interest rate to a rate lower than the current market rate, one restructured loan was considered a TDR due to modification of terms through principal payment forbearance, paying interest only for a specified period of time, as well as adjustments to maturity, and one restructured loan was considered a TDR due to modification of terms through principal payment forbearance only for a specified period of time. At September 30, 2016, one of the TDRs was in default of its modified terms and is included in nonaccrual loans. The Company individually evaluates each TDR for allowance purposes, primarily based on collateral value, and excludes these loans from the loan population that is evaluated by applying qualitative factors.  
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company was not committed to lend additional funds to any customer whose loan was classified as a TDR.

NOTE 6. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
 Equity Incentive Plan.  The Company s 2014 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan (the  Plan ) authorizes the grant of various types of equity grants and awards, such as restricted stock, stock options and stock appreciation rights to eligible participants, which include all of the Company s employees and non-employee directors. The Plan has reserved 600,000 shares of common stock for grant, award or issuance to directors and employees, including shares underlying granted options. The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors, which determines, within the provisions of the Plan, those eligible employees to whom, and the times at which, grants and awards will be made. The Compensation Committee, in its discretion, may delegate its authority and duties under the Plan to specified officers; however, only the Compensation Committee may approve the terms of grants and awards to the Company s executive officers.    
 Stock Options 
 The Company uses a Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of share-based awards. The Black-Scholes option pricing model incorporates various and highly subjective assumptions, including expected term and expected volatility. Stock option expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $48,000 and $0.1 million, respectively, and $42,000 and $0.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 
 The assumptions presented below were used for the options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

At September 30, 2016, there was $0.8 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.8 years.

    The table below summarizes stock option activity for the   periods presented.  

At September 30, 2016, the shares underlying outstanding stock options and exercisable stock options had aggregate intrinsic values of $0.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively. 
 Time Vested Restricted Stock Awards 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company issued shares of time vested restricted stock with vesting terms ranging from two to five years. The total share-based compensation expense to be recognized for these awards is determined based on the market price of the Company s common stock at the grant date applied to the total number of shares awarded and is amortized over the vesting period.  
 The table below summarizes the time vested restricted stock award activity for the periods presented. 

At September 30, 2016, there was $1.2 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to time vested restricted stock awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.5 years. 

NOTE 7. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
 The Company currently holds interest rate swap contracts to manage exposure against the variability in the expected future cash flows (future interest payments) attributable to changes in the 1-month LIBOR associated with the forecasted issuances of 1-month fixed rate debt arising from a rollover strategy. An interest rate swap is an agreement whereby one party agrees to pay a fixed rate of interest on a notional principal amount in exchange for receiving a floating rate of interest on the same notional amount, for a predetermined period of time, from a second party. The amounts relating to the notional principal amount are not actually exchanged. The maximum length of time over which the Company is currently hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions is approximately 3.9 years. The total notional amount of the derivative contracts is $50.0 million.

     NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (Unaudited) 
   
    For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, a gain of $0.3 million and a loss of $0.4 million, respecti  vely, have been recognized in other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the change in fair value of the interest rate swaps. The swap contracts had an aggregate negative fair value of $1.2 million as   of September 30, 2016 and have been recorded in accrued taxes and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The total accumulated loss of $0.7 million included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidat  ed balance sheet would be reclassified to current earnings if the hedge transactions become probable of not occurring. The Company expects the hedges to remain fully effective during the remaining term of the swap contracts.  
   
 NOTE 8. FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  
 In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure  ( ASC 820 ), disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, is required. The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. Fair value is best determined based upon quoted market prices. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows, and the fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instruments. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the Company.  
 If there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability, a change in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate. In such instances, determining the price at which willing market participants would transact at the measurement date under current market conditions depends on the facts and circumstances and requires use of significant judgment. The fair value is a reasonable point within the range that is most representative of fair value under current market conditions.     
 Fair Value Hierarchy  
 In accordance with ASC 820, the Company groups its financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value.  
  Level 1    Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets. 
  Level 2    Valuation is based upon observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
  Level 3    Valuation is based upon unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs. 
 A financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  
 The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating fair value disclosures for financial instruments:  
 Cash and Due from Banks    For these short-term instruments, fair value is the carrying value. Cash and due from banks is classified in level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.  
 Federal Funds Sold    The fair value is the carrying value. The Company classifies these assets in level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.   
 Investment Securities and Other Equity Securities    Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the Company classifies the securities within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Securities are defined as both long and short positions. Level 1 securities include highly liquid government bonds and exchange-traded equities.   
 25 
 
 INVESTAR HOLDING CORPORATION 
     NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (Unaudited) 
   
    If quoted market prices are not available, the Company estimates fair values using pricing models and discounted cash flows that consider standard in  put factors such as observable market data, benchmark yields, interest rate volatilities, broker/dealer quotes, and credit spreads. Examples of such instruments, which would generally be classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy, include Governm  ent Sponsored Enterprise obligations, corporate bonds and other securities. Mortgage-backed securities are included in level 2 if observable inputs are available. In certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to the va  luation, the Company classifies those securities in level 3. Equity securities are valued based on market quoted prices and are classified in level 1 as they are actively traded.   
 Loans    For variable-rate loans that re-price frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values. Fair values for certain mortgage loans (for example, one-to-four family residential), credit card loans, and other consumer loans are based on quoted market prices of similar instruments sold in conjunction with securitization transactions, adjusted for differences in loan characteristics. Fair values for other loans (for example, commercial real estate and investment property mortgage loans, commercial and industrial loans) are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using market interest rates for comparable loans. Fair values for nonperforming loans, which are loans for which the accrual of interest has stopped or loans that are contractually 90 past due on which interest continues to accrue, are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses or underlying collateral values, where applicable. The Company classifies loans in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  
 Loans held for sale are measured using quoted market prices when available. If quoted market prices are not available, comparable market values or discounted cash flow analyses may be utilized. The Company classifies these assets in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  
 Deposit Liabilities    The fair values disclosed for noninterest-bearing demand deposits are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (that is, their carrying amounts). These noninterest-bearing deposits are classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The carrying amounts of variable-rate (for example interest-bearing checking, savings, and money market accounts), fixed-term money market accounts and certificates of deposit approximate their fair values at the reporting date. Fair values for fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies market interest rates on comparable instruments to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits. All interest-bearing deposits are classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  
 Short-Term Borrowings    The carrying amounts of federal funds purchased, borrowings under repurchase agreements, and other short-term borrowings maturing within 90 days approximate their fair values.  The Company classifies these borrowings in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.   
 Long-Term Borrowings    The fair values of long-term borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flows analyses based on the Company s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The fair value of the Company s long-term debt is therefore classified in level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.   
 Commitments    The fair value of commitments to extend credit was not significant.  
 Derivative Instruments    The fair value for interest rate swap agreements are based upon the amounts required to settle the contracts. These derivative instruments are classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

 The expense for income taxes and the effective tax rate included in the consolidated statements of operations are shown in the table below for the periods presented (dollars in thousands).  

The effective tax rates differ from the statutory tax rate of 35% largely due to tax exempt interest income earned on certain investment securities.  
   
 NOTE 10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  
 The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk entered into in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit consisting of loan commitments and standby letters of credit, which are not included in the accompanying financial statements.  
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend money with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses. The Company applies the same credit standards used in the lending process when extending these commitments, and periodically reassesses the customer s creditworthiness through ongoing credit reviews. Since some commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Collateral is obtained based on the Company s assessment of the transaction. Essentially all standby letters of credit issued have expiration dates within one year. 
 The table below shows the approximate amounts of the Company s commitments to extend credit as of the dates presented (dollars in thousands). 

Additionally, at September 30, 2016, the Company had unfunded commitments of $0.9 million for its investment in Small Business Investment Company qualified funds.

I  TEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   
 This section presents management s perspective on the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Investar Holding Corporation (the  Company,   we,   our,  or  us ) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Investar Bank (the  Bank ). The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included herein, and the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, including the notes thereto, and the related Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Annual Report on Form 10-K that the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on March 11, 2016.  
 Overview  
 Through our wholly-owned subsidiary Investar Bank, we provide full banking services, excluding trust services, tailored primarily to meet the needs of individuals and small to medium-sized businesses in our primary areas of operation in South Louisiana: Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Lafayette, Hammond and their surrounding metropolitan areas. Our Bank commenced operations in 2006 and we completed our initial public offering in July 2014. Our strategy includes organic growth through high quality loans, and growth through acquisitions. We currently operate 10 full service branches. We have completed construction of one new branch in Gonzales, Louisiana in our Baton Rouge market area, expected to open in 2017, and in September 2015, acquired land and a building for an additional branch in our New Orleans market area. We continue to focus on growing our deposit base in our markets. We completed acquisitions in 2011 and 2013 and regularly review acquisition opportunities. 
 Our principal business is lending to and accepting deposits from individuals and small to medium-sized businesses in our areas of operation. We generate our income principally from interest on loans and, to a lesser extent, our securities investments, as well as from fees charged in connection with our various loan and deposit services and gains on the sale of securities. Our principal expenses are interest expense on interest-bearing customer deposits and borrowings, salaries, employee benefits, occupancy costs, data processing and other operating expenses. We measure our performance through our net interest margin, return on average assets, and return on average equity, among other metrics, while seeking to maintain appropriate regulatory leverage and risk-based capital ratios.  
 Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, net income was $2.0 million, or $0.29 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $1.8 million, or $0.26 per basic and diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, our net interest margin was 3.23%, return on average assets was 0.71%, and return on average equity was 7.15%. From December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016, total loans increased $101.4 million, or 13.6%, and total deposits increased $169.4 million, or 23.0%. As of September 30, 2016, the Company and Bank each were in compliance with all regulatory capital requirements, and the Bank was considered  well-capitalized  under the FDIC s prompt corrective action regulations.  
 Loans  
 General . Loans, excluding loans held for sale, or total loans, constitute our most significant asset, comprising 73.4% and 72.3% of our total assets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Total loans increased $101.4 million, or 13.6%, to $846.8 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $745.4 million at December 31, 2015 as a result of organic growth in our business.   
 30 

The table below sets forth the composition of the Company s loan portfolio as of the dates indicated (dollars in thousands).   

The following table sets forth loans outstanding at September 30, 2016, which, based on remaining scheduled repayments of principal, are due in the periods indicated. Loans with balloon payments and longer amortizations are often repriced and extended beyond the initial maturity when credit conditions remain satisfactory. Demand loans, loans having no stated schedule of repayments and no stated maturity and overdrafts are reported below as due in one year or less.  

Loans Held for Sale . Loans held for sale consist of consumer loans and decreased $39.9 million, or 49.6%, to $40.6 million at September 30, 2016 from $80.5 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease in loans held for sale is mainly attributable to the sale of approximately $22.0 million of consumer loans held for sale during the first quarter of 2016 and principal payments on consumer loan balances.   Since the Bank discontinued accepting indirect auto loan applications at the end of 2015, which was the primary source of its consumer loan portfolio and loans held for sale, the consumer loan portfolio and loans held for sale are expected to decrease over time. There were no gains on the sale of consumer loans recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.   For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized gains from the sale of consumer loans of $0.3 million, compared to $2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Bank currently has the intent and ability to sell the balance of the consumer loans classified as held for sale at September 30, 2016; however, if this classification were to change, the loans would be transferred to the consumer loan portfolio. To a lesser extent, the decreases in gains on sale of loans is also due to our decision to significantly reduce our mortgage operations. Originations of mortgage loans in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $0.6 million, compared to $40.7 million in the same period in 2015.  
 Loan Concentrations . Loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to multiple borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had no concentrations of loans exceeding 10% of total loans other than loans in the categories listed in the table above.   
 31 

We continue to monitor our loan portfolio for exposure to potential negative impacts of low oil and gas prices. We   consider our exposure to the energy sector not to be significant, at less than one percent of the total loan portfolio at September 30, 2016. However, should the price of oil and gas decline further and/or remain at the current low price for an extended p  eriod, the general economic conditions in our South Louisiana markets could be negatively affected and could negatively impact borrowers  ability to service their debt.  
 Investment Securities  
 We purchase investment securities primarily to provide a source for meeting liquidity needs, with return on investment a secondary consideration. We also use investment securities as collateral for certain deposits and other types of borrowing. Investment securities represented 14.8% of our total assets and totaled $170.4 million at September 30, 2016, an increase of $30.6 million, or 21.9%, from $139.8 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in investment securities at September 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 resulted from purchases of various investment types in our current portfolio to manage liquidity. 
 The following table shows the carrying value of our investment securities portfolio by investment type and the percentage that such investment type comprises of our entire portfolio as of the dates indicated (dollars in thousands). 

The investment portfolio consists of available for sale and held to maturity securities. We classify debt securities as held to maturity if management has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Held to maturity securities are stated at amortized cost. Securities not classified as held to maturity or trading are classified as available for sale. The carrying values of the Company s available for sale securities are adjusted for unrealized gains or losses as valuation allowances, and any gains or losses are reported on an after-tax basis as a component of other comprehensive income. Any expected credit loss due to the inability to collect all amounts due according to the security s contractual terms is recognized as a charge against earnings. Any remaining unrealized loss related to other factors would be recognized in other comprehensive income, net of taxes. 
 The following table sets forth the stated maturities and weighted average yields of our investment debt securities based on the amortized cost of our investment portfolio as of September 30, 2016 (dollars in thousands).  

32 

The maturity of mortgage-backed securities reflects scheduled repayments based upon the contractual maturities of the securities. Weighted average yields on tax-exempt obligations have been computed on a fully tax   equivalent basis assuming a federal tax rate of 35%.  
 Deposits  
 The following table sets forth the composition of our deposits and the percentage of each deposit type to total deposits at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands).  

Total deposits were $907.0 million at September 30, 2016, an increase of $169.6 million, or 23.0%, compared to December 31, 2015. The increase in total deposits was driven by an increase in noninterest-bearing deposits of $22.0 million, or 24.3%, an increase in money market accounts of $27.4 million, or 28.5%, and an increase in time deposits of $112.7 million, or 31.6%, compared to December 31, 2015. The increase in deposits at September 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 resulted from organic growth in all of our markets, and the Company s focus on relationship banking which continues to positively impact noninterest-bearing demand deposit growth. Growth in time deposits also reflected an increase in time deposit rates, particularly on deposits greater than $100,000, which we began lowering during and after the third quarter of 2016. See  Results of Operations   Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin.  
 The following table shows the contractual maturities of certificates of deposit and other time deposits greater than $100,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands).  

Borrowings  
 Total borrowings include securities sold under agreements to repurchase, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ), unsecured lines of credit with First National Bankers Bank ( FNBB ) and The Independent Bankers Bank ( TIB ), and junior subordinated debentures. In addition, in June 2016, we entered into a loan agreement with TIB providing for a $20 million secured revolving line of credit maturing June 27, 2018, as further described under the heading  Liquidity and Capital Resources . There was no outstanding balance on this line of credit at September 30, 2016. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased $15.5 million to $23.6 million at September 30, 2016 from $39.1 million at December 31, 2015. Our advances from the FHLB were $88.9 million at September 30, 2016, a decrease of $38.6 million, or 30.2%, from FHLB advances of $127.5 million at December 31, 2015. We had no funds drawn on the lines of credit at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. The $3.6 million in junior subordinated debt at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 represents the junior subordinated debentures that we assumed through acquisition.

 Performance Summary  
 Three months ended September 30, 2016 vs. three months ended September 30, 2015 . For the three months ended September 30, 2016, net income was $2.0 million, or $0.29 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $1.8 million, or $0.26 per basic and diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Return on average assets decreased to 0.71% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 0.78% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to a $190.4 million increase in average assets. Return on average equity was 7.15% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 6.83% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.   
 Nine months ended September 30, 2016 vs. nine months ended September 30, 2015 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net income was $6.0 million, or $0.85 per basic share and $0.84 per diluted share, compared to net income of $5.6 million, or $0.78 per basic and diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Return on average assets decreased to 0.74% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 0.83% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to a $187.0 million increase in average assets. Return on average equity was 7.17% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 7.06% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   
 Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin  
 Net interest income, which is the largest component of our earnings, is the difference between interest earned on assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The primary factors affecting net interest income are the volume, yield and mix of our rate-sensitive assets and liabilities, as well as the amount of our nonperforming loans and the interest rate environment.  
 The primary factors affecting net interest margin are changes in interest rates, competition and the shape of the interest rate yield curve. The decline in interest rates since 2008 has put significant downward pressure on net interest margin over the past few years. Each rate reduction in interest rate indices (and, in particular, the prime rate, rates paid on U.S. Treasury securities and the London Interbank Offering Rate) resulted in a reduction in the yield on our variable rate loans indexed to one of these indices. However, rates on our deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities did not decline proportionally. To offset the effects on our net interest income and net interest margin from the prevailing interest rate environment, we have attempted to focus our interest-earning assets in loans and shift our interest-bearing liabilities from higher-costing deposits, like certificates of deposit, to noninterest-bearing and other lower cost deposits.  
   
 Three months ended September 30, 2016 vs. three months ended September 30, 2015 . Net interest income increased 10.1% to $8.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $8.0 million for the same period in 2015. This increase is due primarily to the $97.2 million and $67.1 million increases in average loans and average investment securities, respectively, when compared to the same period in 2015, resulting in a $1.5 million increase in interest income, discussed in more detail below. Average interest-bearing deposits and short- and long-term borrowings increased approximately $150.4 million and $16.6 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, resulting in a $0.7 million increase in interest expense, also discussed in more detail below. The increases in both average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are a result of organic growth of the Company.   
   
   Interest income was $11.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $9.5 million for the same period in 2015. Loan interest income made up substantially all of our interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Increases in interest income can be attributed to an increase in the volume of interest-earning assets. The overall yield on interest-earning assets decreased 14 basis points to 4.06% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 4.20% for the same period in 2015. The reduction in yield on interest-earning assets is the result of a prolonged low interest rate environment, as well as an increase in nonaccrual loans. The loan portfolio yielded 4.54% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 4.55%  
 34 

for the three months ended September 30, 2015, while the yield on the investment portf  olio was 2.19% for both the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.   
 Interest expense was $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $0.7 million compared to interest expense of $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, as a result of an increase of $0.3 million attributed to volume and $0.4 million attributed to the increase in the rate of interest-bearing liabilities. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased approximately $166.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 mainly as a result of our organic deposit growth and an increase in short-term borrowings to fund increased lending activity. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 16 basis points to 0.98% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 0.82% for the same period in 2015, primarily as a result of an increase in rates offered to our customers for time deposits. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company began lowering its rates on time deposits in an effort to begin reducing the cost of funds. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, time deposit rates have been lowered further as we attempt to improve our funding costs. 
 Net interest margin was 3.23% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, down 29 basis points from 3.52% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in net interest margin is attributable to the decrease in the overall yield on interest-earning assets, partially due to the increase in nonaccrual loans discussed in  Risk Management  below, and the increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities discussed above.

 Nine months ended September 30, 2016 vs. nine months ended September 30, 2015 . Net interest income increased 11.7% to $26.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $23.2 million for the same period in 2015. This increase is due primarily to the $112.5 million and $57.5 million increases in average loans and average investment securities, respectively, when compared to the same period in 2015, resulting in a $4.6 million increase in interest income, discussed in more detail below. Average interest-bearing deposits and short- and long-term borrowings increased approximately $121.6 million and $43.4 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, resulting in a $1.9 million increase in interest expense, also discussed in more detail below. The increases in both average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are a result of organic growth of the Company.   
 Interest income was $32.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $27.5 million for the same period in 2015. Loan interest income made up substantially all of our interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The increase in interest income was a direct result of continued growth of the Company s loan and investment portfolios with an increase in interest income of $4.9 million due to an increase in volume offset by a $0.3 million decrease related to a reduction in yield. The overall yield on interest-earning assets decreased 16 basis points to 4.15% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 4.31% for the same period in 2015. The loan portfolio yielded 4.57% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 4.67% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The reduction in yield on the loan portfolio is the result of a prolonged interest rate environment, as well as an increase in nonaccrual loans. The yield on the investment portfolio was 2.34% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2.21% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
 Interest expense was $6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $1.9 million compared to interest expense of $4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, as a result of increases in both the volume and cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased approximately $165.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 as a result of our organic deposit growth and an increase in short-term borrowings to fund increased lending activity. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 14 basis points to 0.94% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 0.80% for the same period in 2015, primarily as a result of the cost of short-term borrowings and an increase in rates offered to our customers for time deposits, as discussed above.

Net interest margin was 3.3  6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, down 28 basis points from 3.64% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in net interest margin is attributable to the decrease in the overall yield on interest-earning assets and the incre  ase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities discussed above.

 Noninterest Income  
 Noninterest income includes, among other things, fees generated from our deposit services and loans held for sale, servicing fees, and gain on sale of investment securities, fixed assets, other real estate owned and loans. We expect to continue to develop new products that generate noninterest income, and enhance our existing products, in order to diversify our revenue sources. 
 Three months ended September 30, 2016 vs. three months ended September 30, 2015 . Total noninterest income decreased $1.2 million, or 52.5%, to $1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in noninterest income is mainly attributable to the $1.0 million decrease in the gain on sale of loans. As discussed in  Loans  above, the gain on sale of loans decreased due to the Bank s decision to exit the indirect auto loan origination business at the end of 2015.   
 Fee income on loans held for sale decreased to $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0.3 million for the same period in 2015 due to the decrease in originations of loans held for sale, as discussed in  Loans  above. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2016 vs. nine months ended September 30, 2015 . Total noninterest income decreased $2.2 million, or 32.5%, to $4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $6.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in noninterest income is mainly attributable to the $3.5 million decrease in gain on sale of loans when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in the gain on sale of loans was offset by a $1.2 million increase in the gain on sale of fixed assets recognized for the sale of the land and building of one of the Bank s branch locations to a healthcare company when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   
 Fee income on loans held for sale decreased to $0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $0.8 million for the same period in 2015 due to the decrease in originations of consumer loans held for sale, as discussed in  Loans  above. 
 38 

Servicing fees, which are fees collected for servicing loans which have been sold and are held in our servicing portfolio, increased $0.2 million, or 19.  3%, to $1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is directly related to the increase in the size of our servicing portfolio, which is comprised of indirect auto loans, since   September 30, 2015. Since the Company exited the indirect auto loan origination business at the end of 2015, we expect our servicing portfolio to decrease as borrowers make principal payments on their loans. As a result, our servicing fees will also decre  ase over time.  
 Other operating income primarily consists of interchange fees, credit card fees, ATM surcharge income, and the net change in the value of bank owned life insurance, among other items. Other operating income was $0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0.5 million for the same period in 2015. The increase is mainly a result of a $138,000 increase in the value of bank owned life insurance and a $35,000 increase in credit card fees. 
 Noninterest Expense  
 Three months ended September 30, 2016 vs. three months ended September 30, 2015 . Total noninterest expense was $6.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $0.5 million, or 6.6%, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease is primarily due to a $0.2 million decrease in salaries and benefits and a $0.4 million decrease in other operating expenses. Along with its normal operating expenses, during the third quarter of 2016, the Company recorded additional expense in other operating expenses of approximately $31,000 related to employee and community assistance as a result of the August flooding.  
 Nine months ended September 30, 2016 vs. nine months ended September 30, 2015 . Total noninterest expense was $20.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 0.4%, compared to the same period in 2015. Decreases in salaries and benefits and in other operating expenses were offset by increases in professional fees, marketing and $0.6 million in customer reimbursements paid to certain borrowers during the second quarter of 2016.  
 Although we are focused on growth, both organically and through acquisition, we are committed to managing our costs within the framework of our operating strategy. 
 Income Tax Expense  
 Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $0.7 million, a decrease of $0.1 million, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 26.8% and 31.4%, respectively. The Company recorded a $0.1 million tax benefit during the quarter related to the filing of its 2015 tax return which contributed to the lower effective tax rate during the third quarter of 2016. Management expects the effective income tax rate to approximate 32.5% for the fourth quarter of 2016. 
 Income tax expense for both the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $2.8 million. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 31.4 % and 33.0%, respectively.  
 Risk Management  
 The primary risks associated with our operations are credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Credit and interest rate risk are discussed below, while liquidity risk is discussed in this section under the heading  Liquidity and Capital Resources  below.  
 Credit Risk and the Allowance for Loan Losses  
 General.  The risk of loss should a borrower default on a loan is inherent in any lending activity. Our portfolio and related credit risk are monitored and managed on an ongoing basis by our risk management department, the board of directors  loan committee and the full board of directors. We utilize a ten point risk-rating system, which assigns a risk grade to each borrower based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors associated with a loan transaction. The risk grade categorizes the loan into one of five risk categories, based on information about the ability of borrowers to service the debt. The information includes, among other factors, current financial information about the borrower, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information and current economic trends. These categories assist management in monitoring our credit quality. The following describes each of the risk categories, which are consistent with the definitions used in guidance promulgated by federal banking regulators:  

Pass (grades 1-6)     Loans not meeting the criteria below are considered pass. These loans have high credit characteristics and financial strength. The borrowers at least generate profits and cash flow that are in line with peer and industry standards and have debt service coverage ratios above loan covenants and our policy guidelines. For some of these loans,      

 39 

a guaranty from a financially capable party mitigates chara  cteristics of the borrower that might otherwise result in a lower grade.      

Special Mention (grade 7)     Loans classified as special mention possess some credit deficiencies that need to be corrected to avoid a greater risk of default in the future. For example, financial ratios relating to the borrower may have deteriorated. Often, a special mention categorization is temporary while certain factors are analyzed or matters addressed before the loan is re-categorized as either pass or substandard.      

Substandard (grade 8)     Loans rated as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the liquidation value of any collateral. If deficiencies are not addressed, it is likely that this category of loan will result in the Bank incurring a loss. Where a borrower has been unable to adjust to industry or general economic conditions, the borrower s loan is often categorized as substandard.      

Doubtful (grade 9)     Doubtful loans are substandard loans with one or more additional negative factors that makes full collection of amounts outstanding, either through repayment or liquidation of collateral, highly questionable and improbable.      

Loss (grade 10)     Loans classified as loss have deteriorated to such a point that it is not practicable to defer writing off the loan. For these loans, all efforts to remediate the loan s negative characteristics have failed and the value of the collateral, if any, has severely deteriorated relative to the amount outstanding. Although some value may be recovered on such a loan, it is not significant in relation to the amount borrowed.      

 At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no loans classified as doubtful or loss, while there were $10.2 million and $6.7 million, respectively, of loans classified as substandard. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $2.6 million and $1.4 million, respectively, of loans were classified as special mention. Of our substandard and special mention loans at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $1.3 million and $1.6 million, respectively, were acquired and marked to fair value at the time of their acquisition. 
 An external loan review consultant is engaged annually by the risk management department to review approximately 40% of commercial loans, utilizing a risk-based approach designed to maximize the effectiveness of the review. In addition, credit analysts periodically review smaller dollar commercial loans to identify negative financial trends related to any one borrower, any related groups of borrowers or an industry. All loans not categorized as pass are put on an internal watch list, with quarterly reports to the board of directors. In addition, a written status report is maintained by our special assets division for all commercial loans categorized as substandard or worse. We use this information in connection with our collection efforts. 
 If our collection efforts are unsuccessful, collateral securing loans may be repossessed and sold or, for loans secured by real estate, foreclosure proceedings initiated. The collateral is sold at public auction for fair market value, with fees associated with the foreclosure being deducted from the sales price. The purchase price is applied to the outstanding loan balance. If the loan balance is greater than the sales proceeds, the deficient balance is charged-off. 
 Allowance for Loan Losses . The allowance for loan losses is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the entire loan portfolio. The appropriate level of the allowance is based on an ongoing analysis of the loan portfolio and represents an amount that management deems adequate to provide for inherent losses, including collective impairment as recognized under ASC 450,  Contingencies . Collective impairment is calculated based on loans grouped by grade. Another component of the allowance is losses on loans assessed as impaired under ASC 310,  Receivables . The balance of these loans and their related allowance is included in management s estimation and analysis of the allowance for loan losses. Other considerations in establishing the allowance for loan losses include the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, historical loan loss, review of specific problem loans and current economic conditions that may affect our borrowers  ability to pay, as well as trends within each of these factors. The allowance for loan losses is established after input from management as well as our risk management department and our special assets committee. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. The allowance for loan losses was $7.4 million at September 30, 2016, up from $6.1 million at December 31, 2015, as we increased our loan loss provisioning to reflect our nonperforming and organic loan growth.

A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal   and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Determination of impairment is treated the same across all classes of loans. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for, among others, all loans of $500,000 or greater  , nonaccrual loans and a sample of loans between $250,000 and $500,000. When we identify a loan as impaired, we measure the extent of the impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan s effective interest rate,   except when the sole (remaining) source of repayment for the loans is the operation or liquidation of the collateral. In these cases when foreclosure is probable, we use the current fair value of the collateral, less selling costs, instead of discounted c  ash flows. For real estate collateral, the fair value of the collateral is based upon a recent appraisal by a qualified and licensed appraiser. If we determine that the value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan (net of pre  vious charge-offs, deferred loan fees or costs and unamortized premium or discount), we recognize impairment through an allowance estimate or a charge-off recorded against the allowance. When the ultimate collectability of the total principal of an impaire  d loan is in doubt and the loan is on nonaccrual, all payments are applied to principal, under the cost recovery method. When the ultimate collectability of the total principal of an impaired loan is not in doubt and the loan is on nonaccrual, contractual   interest is credited to interest income when received, under the cash basis method.  
 Impaired loans at September 30, 2016 were $11.6 million, including impaired loans acquired through acquisition in the amount of $2.0 million, compared to $4.0 million, including impaired loans acquired through acquisition in the amount of $1.5 million, at December 31, 2015. The increase in impaired loans, driven by an increase in nonaccrual loans, is mainly due to a $4.7 million owner-occupied commercial real estate loan relationship and a $2.6 million commercial and industrial loan relationship not related to the oil and gas industry that were placed on nonaccrual during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Management has recorded a specific reserve against the $4.7 million loan of $0.5 million in the allowance for loan losses. The Company has determined that a specific reserve is no longer required on the $2.6 million loan as it believes sufficient collateral exists after receiving additional cash collateral from the borrower. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, the Company received a $0.5 million principal pay-down on this loan relationship. A bankruptcy plan was accepted by the borrower s creditors and the Company does not expect a loss on this loan at this time. As a result of the loan remaining currently throughout the bankruptcy process and the additional cash collateral, the Company anticipates the loan to be placed back on accrual during the fourth quarter. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $0.7 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of the allowance for loan losses was specifically allocated to impaired loans.  
 The provision for loan losses is a charge to expense in an amount that management believes is necessary to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses. The provision is based on management s regular evaluation of current economic conditions in our specific markets as well as regionally and nationally, changes in the character and size of the loan portfolio, underlying collateral values securing loans, and other factors which deserve recognition in estimating loan losses. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the provision for loan losses was $0.5 million and $0.4 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the provision for loan losses was $1.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively. The increase over the three-month comparative period can be attributed to the overall growth of the loan portfolio. The increase over the nine-month comparative period is primarily due to the increase in impaired loans mentioned above. 
 Acquired loans that are accounted for under ASC 310-30,  Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality  ( ASC 310-30 ), were marked to market on the date we acquired the loans to values which, in management s opinion, reflected the estimated future cash flows, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each respective loan at the date of acquisition. We continually monitor these loans as part of our normal credit review and monitoring procedures for changes in the estimated future cash flows. Because ASC 310-30 does not permit carry over or recognition of an allowance for loan losses, we may be required to reserve for these loans in the allowance for loan losses through future provision for loan losses if future cash flows deteriorate below initial projections. 
 The following table presents the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category as of the dates indicated (dollars in thousands). 

41 

As discussed above, the balance in the allowance for loan losses is principally influenced by the provision for loan losses and by net loan loss experience. Additions to the allowance are charged to the provision for loan losses. Losses are charged to the   allowance as incurred and recoveries on losses previously charged to the allowance are credited to the allowance at the time recovery is collected. The table below reflects the activity in the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated (dollars in   thousands).   

The allowance for loan losses to total loans ratio increased to 0.87% at September 30, 2016 compared to 0.83% at September 30, 2015. The allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans ratio decreased to 82.44% at September 30, 2016 from 226.43% at September 30, 2015. The decrease in the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans ratio is due to a $6.3 million increase in nonperforming loans. Nonperforming loans were $9.0 million, or 1.06% of total loans, at September 30, 2016, compared to $2.4 million, or 0.32% of total loans at December 31, 2015. The increase in nonperforming loans is mainly due to the $4.7 million owner-occupied commercial real estate loan relationship and the $2.6 million commercial and industrial loan relationship mentioned above.  
 Charge-offs reflect the realization of losses in the portfolio that were recognized previously through the provision for loan losses. Net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $0.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively, equal to 0.02% and 0.06%, respectively, of our average loan balance as of that date. Net charge-offs for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were $0.2 million, equal to 0.03% of our average loan balance as of that date. 
   
 The Company has instituted a 90-day loan deferral program for customers who were impacted by the flood and has allocated a portion of its general reserves to the potential impact as a result of the flood. The Company placed approximately $23.5 million, or 2.8% of the total loan portfolio on a 90-day deferral plan. The Company continues to assess the impact the flooding may have on the region and its loan portfolio to determine the need for specific or additional general reserves. 
   
 Management believes the allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2016 is sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses in our portfolio. Although the allowance for loan losses is considered adequate by management, there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover ultimate losses in connection with our loans. This allowance may prove to be inadequate due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or discrete events adversely affecting specific customers or industries. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected to the extent that the allowance is insufficient to cover such changes or events.

Nonperforming Assets and Restructured Loans  . Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and oth  er real estate owned. Nonperforming loans are those on which the accrual of interest has stopped or loans which are contractually 90 days past due on which interest continues to accrue. Loans are ordinarily placed on nonaccrual when a loan is specifically   determined to be impaired or when principal and interest is delinquent for 90 days or more. However, management may elect to continue the accrual when the estimated net available value of collateral is sufficient to cover the principal balance and accrued   interest. It is our policy to discontinue the accrual of interest income on any loan for which we have reasonable doubt as to the payment of interest or principal. Nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when the financial position of the borrower   indicates there is no longer any reasonable doubt as to the payment of principal or interest.   
 Another category of assets which contributes to our credit risk is troubled debt restructurings ( TDR ), or restructured loans. A restructured loan is a loan for which a concession that is not insignificant has been granted to the borrower due to a deterioration of the borrower s financial condition and which is performing in accordance with the new terms. Such concessions may include reduction in interest rates, deferral of interest or principal payments, principal forgiveness and other actions intended to minimize the economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral. We strive to identify borrowers in financial difficulty early and work with them to modify their loans to more affordable terms before such loan reaches nonaccrual status. In evaluating whether to restructure a loan, management analyzes the long-term financial condition of the borrower, including guarantor and collateral support, to determine whether the proposed concessions will increase the likelihood of repayment of principal and interest. Restructured loans that are not performing in accordance with their restructured terms that are either contractually 90 days past due or placed on nonaccrual status are reported as nonperforming loans. 
 There were twenty loans classified as TDRs at September 30, 2016 that totaled approximately $2.7 million, compared to eleven loans totaling approximately $2.2 million at December 31, 2015. Eighteen of the twenty TDRs were acquired through acquisition. Nine restructured loans were considered TDRs due to a modification of terms through adjustments to maturity, nine restructured loans were considered TDRs due to a reduction in the interest rate to a rate lower than the current market rate, one restructured loan was considered a TDR due to modification of terms through principal payment forbearance, paying interest only for a specified period of time, as well as adjustments to maturity, and one restructured loan was considered a TDR due to modification of terms through principal payment forbearance only for a specified period of time. As of September 30, 2016, one of the restructured loans with a balance of $0.1 million was in default of its modified terms and had been placed on nonaccrual. At December 31, 2015, three of the restructured loans with a balance of $0.5 million were in default of their modified terms and had been placed on nonaccrual.  
 The following table shows the principal amounts of nonperforming and restructured loans as of the dates indicated. All loans where information exists about possible credit problems that would cause us to have serious doubts about the borrower s ability to comply with the current repayment terms of the loan have been reflected in the table below (dollars in thousands). 

Of the total nonaccrual loans at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $0.6 million and $1.1 million, respectively, were acquired through acquisition. Nonperforming loans are comprised of accruing loans past due 90 days or more and nonaccrual loans. Nonperforming loans outstanding represented 1.06% and 0.32% of total loans at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Nonperforming loans, other than those acquired through an acquisition and nonperforming acquired loans represented 0.98% and 0.08%, respectively, of total loans at September 30, 2016.  
 Other Real Estate Owned.  Other real estate owned consists of properties acquired through foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. These properties are carried at the lower of cost or fair market value based on appraised value less estimated selling costs. Losses arising at the time of foreclosure of properties are charged to the allowance for loan losses. Other real estate owned with a cost basis of $0.5 million was sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, resulting in a net gain of $11,000 for the period. There were no sales of other real estate owned during the three months ended September 30, 2016. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, other real estate owned with a cost basis $1.3 million and $1.9 million, respectively, was sold resulting in a net loss of $0.1 million for both periods. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $0.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively of our other real estate owned was related to loans acquired through acquisition.

The following table provides details of our other real estate owned as of the dates indicated (dollars in thousands).   

Changes in our other real estate owned are summarized in the table below for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands). 

Interest Rate Risk  
 Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates. Since the majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature, our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in our lending and deposit activities. A sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact our earnings and profitability because the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed, to the same extent or on the same basis. Accordingly, our ability to proactively structure the volume and mix of our assets and liabilities to address anticipated changes in interest rates, as well as to react quickly to such fluctuations, can significantly impact our financial results. To that end, management actively monitors and manages our interest rate risk exposure.  
 The Asset Liability Committee ( ALCO ) has been authorized by the board of directors to implement our asset/liability management policy, which establishes guidelines with respect to our exposure to interest rate fluctuations, liquidity, loan limits as a percentage of funding sources, exposure to correspondent banks and brokers and reliance on non-core deposits. The goal of the policy is to enable us to maximize our interest income and maintain our net interest margin without exposing the Bank to excessive interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Within that framework, the ALCO monitors our interest rate sensitivity and makes decisions relating to our asset/liability composition.  
 We monitor the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income using gap analysis. The gap represents the net position of our assets and liabilities subject to repricing in specified time periods. During any given time period, if the amount of rate-sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of rate-sensitive assets, a financial institution would generally be considered to have a negative gap position and would benefit from falling rates over that period of time. Conversely, a financial institution with a positive gap position would generally benefit from rising rates.  
 Within the gap position that management directs, we attempt to structure our assets and liabilities to minimize the risk of either a rising or falling interest rate environment. We manage our gap position for time horizons of one month, two months, three months, 4-6 months, 7-12 months, 13-24 months, 25-36 months, 37-60 months and more than 60 months. The goal of our asset/liability management is for the Bank to maintain a net interest income at risk in an up or down 100 basis point environment at less than (5)%. At September 30, 2016, the Bank was within the policy guidelines for asset/liability management. 
 44 

The table below depicts the estimated impact on net interest income of immediate c  hanges in interest rates at the specified levels.   

(1)    
 
   The percentage change in this column represents the projected net interest income for 12 months on a flat balance sheet in a stable interest rate environment versus the projected net interest income in the various rate scenarios.    

 The computation of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes requires numerous assumptions regarding characteristics of new business and the behavior of existing positions. These business assumptions are based upon our experience, business plans and published industry experience. Key assumptions include asset prepayment speeds, competitive factors, the relative price sensitivity of certain assets and liabilities and the expected life of non-maturity deposits. However, there are a number of factors that influence the effect of interest rate fluctuations on us which are difficult to measure and predict. For example, a rapid drop in interest rates might cause our loans to repay at a more rapid pace and certain mortgage-related investments to prepay more quickly than projected. This could mitigate some of the benefits of falling rates as are expected when we are in a negatively-gapped position. Conversely, a rapid rise in rates could give us an opportunity to increase our margins and stifle the rate of repayment on our mortgage-related loans which would increase our returns. As a result, because these assumptions are inherently uncertain, actual results will differ from simulated results.  
 Liquidity and Capital Resources  
 Liquidity.  Liquidity is a measure of the ability to fund loan commitments and meet deposit maturities and withdrawals in a timely and cost-effective way. Cash flow requirements can be met by generating net income, attracting new deposits, converting assets to cash or borrowing funds. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit outflows, loan prepayments, loan sales and borrowings are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and the competitive environment in which we operate. To minimize funding risks, we closely monitor our liquidity position through periodic reviews of maturity profiles, yield and rate behaviors, and loan and deposit forecasts. Excess short-term liquidity is usually invested in overnight federal funds sold.   
 Our core deposits, which are deposits excluding time deposits greater than $250,000 and deposits of municipalities and other political entities, are our most stable source of liquidity to meet our cash flow needs due to the nature of the long-term relationships generally established with our customers. Maintaining the ability to acquire these funds as needed in a variety of markets, and within ALCO compliance targets, is essential to ensuring our liquidity. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, 76% and 69% of our total assets, respectively, were funded by core deposits.  
 Our investment portfolio is another alternative for meeting our cash flow requirements. Investment securities generate cash flow through principal payments and maturities, and they generally have readily available markets that allow for their conversion to cash. Some securities are pledged to secure certain deposit types or short-term borrowings, such as FHLB advances, which impacts their liquidity. At September 30, 2016, securities with a carrying value of $59.9 million were pledged to secure certain deposits, borrowings, and other liabilities, compared to $58.8 million in pledged securities as of December 31, 2015.  
 45 

Other sources available for meeting liquidity needs include advances from the FHLB, repurchase agreements and other borrowings. FHLB advances   are primarily used to match-fund fixed rate loans in order to minimize interest rate risk and also may be used to meet day to day liquidity needs, particularly if the prevailing interest rate on an FHLB advance compares favorably to the rates that we would   be required to pay to attract deposits. At September 30, 2016, the balance of our outstanding advances with the FHLB was $88.9 million, a decrease from $127.5 million at December 31, 2015. The total amount of the remaining credit available to us from the   FHLB at September 30, 2016 was $355.2 million. Repurchase agreements are contracts for the sale of securities which we own with a corresponding agreement to repurchase those securities at an agreed upon price and date. Our policies limit the use of repurch  ase agreements to those collateralized by U.S. Treasury and agency securities. We had $23.6 million of repurchase agreements outstanding as of September 30, 2016, compared to $39.1 million of outstanding repurchase agreements as of December 31, 2015.  We m  aintain unsecured lines of credit with other commercial banks totaling $55.0 million. The lines of credit mature at various times within the next nine months. There were no amounts outstanding under these lines of credit at September 30, 2016 or December 3  1, 2015.  
 In addition, on June 27, 2016, we entered into a loan agreement ( Agreement ) with TIB providing for a $20 million revolving line of credit maturing June 27, 2018. Borrowings bear interest, payable quarterly, at a fixed rate per annum equal to the U.S. prime rate on June 27, 2016 (3.5%); provided, however, that on June 27, 2017, the rate will be adjusted to a fixed rate of interest equal to the prime rate on such date. The revolving line of credit is secured by a first priority security interest in all of the capital stock of Investar Bank and a security interest in all property of Investar Bank held by the lender. There were no amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit at September 30, 2016. 
 The loan agreement for the revolving line of credit contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default, and also contains a number of negative covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on mergers and similar transactions, restrictions on liens, and a prohibition on the payment of dividends or repurchase of stock during an event of default. The agreement also contains financial covenants, including requiring that Investar Bank maintain (i) a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio and a Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio not less than 7.5% at all times, (ii) a Tier 1 Capital Ratio and a Total Capital Ratio not less than 9.5% at all times, (iii) a return on average assets of no less than 0.70% as of the end of each fiscal quarter, annualized on a year-to-date basis, (iv) Classified Assets (as defined in the Agreement) at no more than 35% of Investar Bank s Tier 1 Capital plus allowance for loan and lease losses, and (v) a total loans to total assets ratio of no more than 85% at all times. 
 Our liquidity strategy is focused on using the least costly funds available to us in the context of our balance sheet composition and interest rate risk position. Accordingly, we target growth of noninterest-bearing deposits. Although we cannot directly control the types of deposit instruments our customers choose, we can influence those choices with the interest rates and deposit specials we offer. We do not hold any brokered deposits, as defined for federal regulatory purposes, although we do hold QwikRate      deposits, included in our time deposit balances, which we obtain via the internet to address liquidity needs when rates on such deposits compare favorably with deposit rates in our markets. At September 30, 2016, we held $131.4 million of QwikRate      deposits, up from $79.3 million at December 31, 2015.  
 The following table presents, by type, our funding sources, which consist of total average deposits and borrowed funds, as a percentage of total funds and the total cost of each funding source for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

46 

Capital Management  . Our primary sources of capital include retained earnings, capital obtained through acquisitions and proceeds from the sale of our capital stock. We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC wh  ich specify capital tiers, including the following classifications.

The  Company and the Bank each were in compliance with all regulatory capital requirements as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The Bank also was considered  well-capitalized  under the FDIC s prompt corrective action regulations as of these dates. The following table presents the actual capital amounts and regulatory capital ratios for the Company and the Bank as of the dates presented  (dollars in thousands).     

Off-Balance Sheet Transactions  
 The Bank entered into interest rate swap contracts to manage exposure against the variability in the expected future cash flows (future interest payments) attributable to changes in the 1-month LIBOR associated with the forecasted issuances of 1-month fixed rate debt arising from a rollover strategy. An interest rate swap is an agreement whereby one party agrees to pay a fixed rate of interest on a notional principal amount in exchange for receiving a floating rate of interest on the same notional amount for a predetermined period of time, from a second party. The maximum length of time over which the Bank is currently hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions is approximately 4 years. The total notional amount of the derivative contracts is $50.0 million. 
 47 

The Bank enters into loan commitments and standby letters of credit in the normal course of its business. Loan commitments are ma  de to meet the financing needs of our customers, while standby letters of credit commit the Bank to make payments on behalf of customers when certain specified future events occur. The credit risks associated with loan commitments and standby letters of cr  edit are essentially the same as those involved in making loans to our customers. Accordingly, our normal credit policies apply to these arrangements. Collateral (e.g., securities, receivables, inventory, equipment, etc.) is obtained based on management s   credit assessment of the customer.  
 Loan commitments and standby letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, in that while the customer typically has the ability to draw upon these commitments at any time, these commitments often expire without being drawn upon in full or at all. Virtually all of our standby letters of credit expire within one year. Our unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit outstanding are summarized below as of the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):  

The Company closely monitors the amount of remaining future commitments to borrowers in light of prevailing economic conditions and adjusts these commitments as necessary. The Company intends to continue this process as new commitments are entered into or existing commitments are renewed.  
 Additionally, at September 30, 2016, the Company had unfunded commitments of $0.9 million for its investment in Small Business Investment Company qualified funds. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2015, except as disclosed herein and in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, we engaged in no off-balance sheet transactions that we believe are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  
 Contractual Obligations  
 There have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in the contractual obligations set forth in the table of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

I  tem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   
 Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of December 31, 2015 are set forth in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 11, 2016 in the section captioned  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Risk Management.  There have been no material changes in the Company s market risk since December 31, 2015. Please refer to the information in Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, under the heading  Risk Management  in this report for additional information about the Company s market risk for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
   
     Item 4. Controls and Procedures  
 Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, the Company s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are effective for ensuring that information the Company is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter covered by this quarterly report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.  

49 

P  ART II. OTHER INFORMATION   
   
     Item 1A. Risk Factors  
 There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed by Investar Holding Corporation (the  Company ) with the SEC on March 11, 2016.  

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds  
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 None.  
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities  
 The table below provides the information with respect to purchases made by the Company of shares of its common stock during each of the months during the three month period ended September 30, 2016.  

(1)    
 
   Includes 2,465 shares surrendered to cover the payroll taxes due upon the vesting of restricted stock.    

(2)    
 
   On February 19, 2015, the Company announced that its board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to 250,000 shares of the Company s common stock in open market transactions from time to time or through privately negotiated transactions in accordance with federal securities laws. In addition, on October 19, 2016, the Company announced that its board of directors authorized an additional 250,000 shares for repurchase.    

 The Company s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders may be limited on account of the junior subordinated debentures that the Company assumed in connection with its acquisition of First Community Bank, which are senior to shares of the Company s common stock. The Company must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures before any dividends can be paid on its common stock.  
 In addition, the Company s status as a bank holding company affects its ability to pay dividends, in two ways:  

As a holding company with no material business activities, the Company s ability to pay dividends is substantially dependent upon the ability of Investar Bank to transfer funds to the Company in the form of dividends, loans and advances. Investar Bank s ability to pay dividends and make other distributions and payments is itself subject to various legal, regulatory and other restrictions.      

As a holding company of a bank, the Company s payment of dividends must comply with the policies and enforcement powers of the Federal Reserve. Under Federal Reserve policies, in general a bank holding company should pay dividends only when (1) its net income available to shareholders over the last four quarters (net of dividends paid) has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends, (2) the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition of the bank holding company and its subsidiaries, and (3) the bank holding company will continue to meet minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.
