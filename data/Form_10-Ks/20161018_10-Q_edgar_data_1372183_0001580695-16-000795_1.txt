Note 1 - Summary of Business Operations and Significant
Accounting Policies  

Nature of Operations and Business Organization   

Monaker Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries
( Monaker ,  we ,  our ,  us , or  Company ) operate an online marketplace
for the alternative lodging rental industry. Alternative lodging rentals (ALRs) are whole unit vacation homes or timeshare resort
units that are fully furnished, privately owned residential properties, including homes, condominiums, villas and cabins, that
property owners and managers rent to the public on a nightly, weekly or monthly basis. Our marketplace, NextTrip.com, unites millions
of travelers seeking ALR online with property owners and managers of over one million vacation rental properties located in over
120 countries around the world. As of August 31, 2016, we operated our online marketplace through 115 websites in 16 languages,
with leading websites in Europe, Asia, South America and the United States. As of August 31, 2016, our global marketplace included
approximately 100,000 paid listings on subscriptions and contracted with over 1.1 million listings under the performance based
listing arrangement ALRs (described in greater detail below). As an added feature to our ALR offering, we also provide activities
and tours at the destinations that are catered to the traveler through our Maupintour products. 

 Our vacation rental platform includes
auxiliary services so travelers can purchase vacations through one site; NextTrip.com (or through other online distributors sourced
by NextTrip.com), and provides qualified inquiries and bookings to property owners and managers. NextTrip serves three major constituents:
property owners and managers, travelers and other distributors. Property owners and managers pay to provide detailed listings of
their properties on our websites with the goal of reaching a broad audience of travelers seeking ALRs. Listing fees paid by property
owners and managers are paid either in the form of subscriptions that are generally for an annual period, or in the form of performance-based
fees that allow for owners and managers to list their properties for free and pay us a commission for successful bookings; this
allows owners and managers to list their property on NextTrip and pay a commission per booking in lieu of a pre-paid subscription
fee. Currently we are working to convert owners and managers away from the subscription format into the performance-based format.
This is transparent to the traveler yet more beneficial to the owners and managers as they accept a larger performance-based fee
in return for relief from the up-front subscription fee and lower booking fee. Travelers visit NextTrip and are able to search
and compare our large and detailed inventory of listings to find ALRs meeting their needs. 

 Monaker is a technology driven travel
and logistics company with ALR inventory. Monaker s inventory consists of ALRs owned and leased by third parties which are
available to rent through Monaker s websites. Core to the Company s services are key elements including technology,
an extensive film library, media distribution, trusted brands and established partnerships that enhance product offerings and
reach. We believe that consumers are quickly adopting video for researching and educating themselves prior to purchases, and Monaker
has carefully amassed video content, media distribution, key industry relationships and a prestigious Travel Brand as cornerstones
for the development and planned deployment of core-technology on both proprietary and partnership platforms. 

Monaker sells travel
services to leisure and corporate customers around the world. The primary focus is on providing ALR options as well as providing
schedule, pricing and availability information for booking reservations for airlines, hotels, rental cars, cruises and other travel
products such as sightseeing tours, show and event tickets and theme park passes. The Company sells these travel services both
individually and as components of dynamically-assembled packaged travel vacations and trips. In addition, the Company provides
content that presents travelers with information about travel destinations, maps and other travel details; this content information
is the product of proprietary video-centered technology that allows the Company to create targeted travel videos from its film
libraries. In January 2016, the Company introduced a beta of its new Travel Platform under the NextTrip brand. This platform is
still under development and continues to be improved with a focus on maximizing the consumer s experience and assisting
them in the decision and purchasing process. 

The platform is a combination
of proprietary and licensed technology that connects and searches large travel suppliers as well as perishing and alternative lodging
inventories to present to consumers comprehensive alternatives at the most inexpensive rates. 

 The Company sells its travel services
through various distribution channels. The primary distribution channel is through its own websites at NextTrip.com and Maupintour.com.
The second distribution channel is selling travel services to customers through a toll-free telephone number designed to assist
customers with complex or high-priced offerings. The remaining distribution channels are in the final stages of deployment and
include sales on other travel companies  websites and sales through networks of third-party travel agents and travel portals. 

Monaker s core holdings
include NextTrip.com, and Maupintour.com along with platforms for vacation home rentals, timeshare rentals and discount travel.
NextTrip.com is the primary website, where travel services are booked. The travel services include, but are not limited to: ALR,
tours, activities/attractions, air, hotel and car rentals. Maupintour feeds into NextTrip.com by providing high-end tour packages
and activities/attractions. 

   Interim
Financial Statements   

 These unaudited consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( US GAAP )
for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the consolidated financial
statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete
financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included
and such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with
the financial statements for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016 and notes thereto and other pertinent information contained
in our Form 10-K the Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). 

 The results of operations for
the six months ended August 31, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year ending
February 28, 2017. 

   Principles
of Consolidation   

 The accompanying consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All material inter-company transactions
and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. 

   Noncontrolling Interest and Investment in Unconsolidated
Affiliates   

 The Company accounts for its less
than 100% interest in consolidated subsidiaries in accordance with ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, and accordingly the Company presents
noncontrolling interests as a component of equity on its consolidated balance sheets and reports noncontrolling interest net loss
under the heading  Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest  in the consolidated statements of operations.
Investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for by either the equity or cost methods, generally depending upon ownership
levels. The equity method of accounting is used when the Company s investment in voting stock of an entity gives it the ability
to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee, which is presumed to be the case when
the Company holds 20% to 50% of the voting stock of, or can otherwise demonstrate significant influence over, the investee. Unconsolidated
affiliate companies in which the Company does not have significant influence and owns less than 20% of the voting stock are accounted
for using the cost method. These investments in unconsolidated affiliates are assessed periodically for impairment and are written
down if and when the carrying amount is considered to be permanently impaired. 

   Use of Estimates   

 The Company s significant
estimates include allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of intangible assets, stock based compensation, accrued expenses and
derivative liabilities. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While the Company
believes that such estimates are fair when considered in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
the actual amounts of such estimates, when known, will vary from these estimates. If actual results significantly differ from the
Company s estimates, the Company s financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted. 

   Cash and Cash Equivalents   

 For purposes of balance sheet
presentation and reporting of cash flows, the Company considers all unrestricted demand deposits, money market funds and highly
liquid debt instruments with an original maturity of less than 90 days to be cash and cash equivalents. The Company had no cash
equivalents at August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016. 

   Accounts Receivable   

 The Company extends credit to
its customers in the normal course of business. Further, the Company regularly reviews outstanding receivables, and provides for
estimated losses through an allowance for doubtful accounts. In evaluating the level of established loss reserves, the Company
makes judgments regarding its customers  ability to make required payments, economic events and other factors. As the financial
condition of these parties change, circumstances develop or additional information becomes available, adjustments to the allowance
for doubtful accounts may be required. The Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses, and such losses traditionally
have been within its expectations. The Company s allowance for doubtful accounts was $0 and $0 at August 31, 2016 and February
29, 2016, respectively. 

Website Development Costs   

 The Company accounts for website
development costs in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 350-50  Website Development Costs . Accordingly,
all costs incurred in the planning stage are expensed as incurred, costs incurred in the website application and infrastructure
development stage that meet specific criteria are capitalized and costs incurred in the day to day operation of the website are
expensed as incurred. All costs associated with the websites are subject to straight-line amortization over a three-year period.
For the six months ended August 31, 2016 and the year ended February 29, 2016, the Company has capitalized costs associated with
website development of $1,179,009 and $1,817,945, respectively, and accumulated amortization of $199,731 and $780,860, respectively. 

Software Development Costs   

 The Company capitalizes internal
software development costs subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of a software application in accordance with guidelines
established by  ASC 985-20-25  Accounting for the Costs of Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed, requiring
certain software development costs to be capitalized upon the establishment of technological feasibility. The establishment of
technological feasibility and the ongoing assessment of the recoverability of these costs require considerable judgment by management
with respect to certain external factors such as anticipated future revenue, estimated economic life, and changes in software and
hardware technologies. Amortization of the capitalized software development costs begins when the product is available for general
release to customers. Capitalized costs are amortized based on the greater of (a) the ratio of current gross revenues to the total
current and anticipated future gross revenues, or (b) the straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the
product. For the six months ended August 31, 2016 and the year ended February 29, 2016, all software has been placed in service
and all costs associated with the software development have been expensed. 

   Impairment of Intangible Assets   

 The Company acquired contracts,
website platforms and domains during the six months ended August 31, 2016 and the year ended February 29, 2016 in the amount of
$0 and $1,588,000, respectively. 

 In accordance with ASC 350-30-65  Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets , the Company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors the Company considers important, which could
trigger an impairment review include the following: 

1.  
      Significant underperformance compared to historical or projected future operating results;   
 
      2.  
      Significant changes in the manner or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business; and    
 
      3.  
      Significant negative industry or economic trends.   

When the Company
determines that the carrying value of an intangible asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of
the above indicators of impairment and the carrying value of the asset cannot be recovered from projected undiscounted cash
flows, the Company records an impairment charge. The Company measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash
flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent to the current business
model. Significant management judgment is required in determining whether an indicator of impairment exists and in projecting
cash flows. The Company did not record an impairment charge on its intangible assets during the six months ended August 31,
2016 and the year ended February 29, 2016, respectively. Intellectual properties that have finite useful lives are amortized over
their useful lives. The Company incurred amortization expense of $215,166 and $164,615 for the six months ended August 31,
2016 and the year ended February 29, 2016, respectively. 

   Convertible Debt Instruments   

The Company records debt net of
debt discount for beneficial conversion features and warrants, on a relative fair value basis. Beneficial conversion features are
recorded pursuant to the Beneficial Conversion and Debt Topics of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The amounts allocated
to warrants and beneficial conversion rights are recorded as debt discount and as additional paid-in-capital. Debt discount is
amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt. 

   Derivative Instruments   

 The Company enters into financing
arrangements that consist of freestanding derivative instruments or are hybrid instruments that contain embedded derivative features.
The Company accounts for these arrangements in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification topic 815, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities ( ASC 815 ) as well as related interpretations of this standard. In accordance with
this standard, derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and are measured at fair
values with gains or losses recognized in earnings. Embedded derivatives that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract
are bifurcated and are recognized at fair value with changes in fair value recognized as either a gain or loss in earnings. The
Company determines the fair value of derivative instruments and hybrid instruments based on available market data using appropriate
valuation models, considering all of the rights and obligations of each instrument. 

The Company estimates fair values
of derivative financial instruments using various techniques (and combinations thereof) that are considered consistent with the
objective measuring fair values. In selecting the appropriate technique, the Company considers, among other factors, the nature
of the instrument, the market risks that it embodies and the expected means of settlement. For less complex derivative instruments,
such as freestanding warrants, the Company generally uses the Black-Scholes model, adjusted for the effect of dilution, because
it embodies all of the requisite assumptions (including trading volatility, estimated terms, dilution and risk free rates) necessary
to fair value these instruments. Estimating fair values of derivative financial instruments requires the development of significant
and subjective estimates that may, and are likely to, change over the duration of the instrument with related changes in internal
and external market factors. In addition, option-based techniques (such as Black- Scholes model) are highly volatile and sensitive
to changes in the trading market price of our common stock. Since derivative financial instruments are initially and subsequently
carried at fair values, our income (expense) going forward will reflect the volatility in these estimates and assumption changes.
Under the terms of this accounting standard, increases in the trading price of the Company s common stock and increases in
fair value during a given financial quarter result in the application of non-cash derivative expense. Conversely, decreases in
the trading price of the Company s common stock and decreases in trading fair value during a given financial quarter result
in the application of non-cash derivative income.  

 Based upon ASC 815-25 the Company
has adopted a sequencing approach regarding the application of ASC 815-40 to its outstanding convertible debentures. Pursuant to
the sequencing approach, the Company evaluates its contracts based upon earliest issuance date. 

   Earnings per Share   

 Basic earnings per share are
computed by dividing net income or loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, common
stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during each period. On June 25, 2015, we effected a 1:50 reverse
stock-split of all of our outstanding shares of common stock. 

   Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

 The Company has adopted the
provisions of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value
in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides
guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. The fair
value hierarchy distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and an entity s own assumptions
(unobservable inputs). The hierarchy consists of three levels: 

 Level 1: Observable inputs that
reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets. 

 Level 2: Inputs other than quoted
prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. 

 Level 3: Inputs that are generally
unobservable. These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management s best estimate
of fair value. 

 Financial instruments consist
principally of cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other current liabilities.
The carrying amounts of such financial instruments in the accompanying balance sheets approximate their fair values due to their
relatively short-term nature. The fair value of long-term debt is based on current rates at which the Company could borrow funds
with similar remaining maturities. The carrying amounts approximate fair value. It is management s opinion that the Company
is not exposed to any significant currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments. 

   Going Concern   

 As of August 31, 2016, and February
29, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $95,595,324 and $93,562,357, respectively. The accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As of August 31, 2016, the Company had a working
capital deficit of $2,305,474 and for the six months ended August 31, 2016, a net loss of $2,032,967 and cash used in operations
of $2,054,826. 

 We have very limited financial
resources. We currently have a monthly cash requirement of approximately $350,000, exclusive of capital expenditures. We will need
to raise substantial additional capital to support the on-going operation and increased market penetration of our products including
the development of national advertising relationships, increases in operating costs resulting from additional staff and office
space until such time as we generate revenues sufficient to support our operations. We believe that in the aggregate, we would
require several millions of dollars to support and expand the marketing and development of our travel products, repay debt obligations,
provide capital expenditures for additional equipment and development costs, payment obligations, office space and systems for
managing the business, and cover other operating costs until our planned revenue streams from travel products are fully-implemented
and begin to offset our operating costs. Our failure to obtain additional capital to finance our working capital needs on acceptable
terms, or at all, will negatively impact our business, financial condition and liquidity. As of August 31, 2016 and February 29,
2016, we had $3,433,580 and $3,035,694, respectively, of current liabilities. These conditions raise substantial doubt of our ability
to continue as a going concern. We currently do not have the resources to satisfy these obligations, and our inability to do so
could have a material adverse effect on our business and ability to continue as a going concern. 

Management s plans with
regard to this going concern are as follows: the Company will continue to raise funds with third parties by way of a public or
private offering; and management and members of the Board are working aggressively to increase the viewership of our products by
promoting it across other mediums which will result in higher revenues. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern
is dependent on the Company s ability to further implement its business plan and generate greater revenues. Management believes
that the actions presently being taken to further implement its business plan and generate additional revenues provide the opportunity
for the Company to continue as a going concern. 

   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

 In May 2014, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, requiring an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects
to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The updated standard will replace most existing revenue
recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect
transition method. Early adoption is not permitted. The updated standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods
within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is currently evaluating
the effect that the updated standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

 In June 2014, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an
Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation. The amendments in this update simplify accounting
guidance by removing all incremental financial reporting requirements for development stage entities. The amendments also reduce
data maintenance and, for those entities subject to audit, audit costs by eliminating the requirement for development stage entities
to present inception-to-date information in the statements of income, cash flows, and shareholder equity. The new standard is effective
for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted.
The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. 

 In August 2014, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s

  Note 3   Investment in Equity Instruments
and Deconsolidation  

 On February 2, 2015, the
Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Jasper Group Holdings, Inc. ( Jasper ) and created a Florida
limited liability company named Name Your Fee, LLC. On April 20, 2015, the Company entered into a Joint Venture Agreement
with Jasper to leverage its existing technology and develop www.NameYourFee.com which provides tools for employment agencies
to market their services. The Company s ownership in the Joint Venture was 51% and Jasper s was 49%. The Company
and Jasper shared in capital contributions as well as participated in the net profits of Name Your Fee, LLC while Jasper
operated and ran the NameYourFee.com website. On May 15, 2015, the Company issued 100,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock
to Jasper at a stated value of $5 per share for a total value of $500,000, as required by the February 2, 2015 agreement. Additionally, Jasper contributed $75,000 in proceeds as part of the agreement. 

 On May 16, 2016, the
Company sold its 51% membership interest in Name Your Fee, LLC to a non-related third party for cancellation of $45,000 in
notes receivable due to the Company and a promissory note from the purchaser in the amount of $750,000. The Promissory Note
does not accrue interest, is secured by the 51% membership interest in Name Your Fee, LLC and will be repaid through 20% of
the net earnings received in NameYourFee.com through maturity. The Note contains standard and customary events of
default. The outstanding principal amount of the note is due on June 15, 2018, provided that it is not in default. 

 On October 31, 2014 (the
 Deconsolidation Date ), Monaker and RealBiz Media Group, Inc. ( RealBiz ) deconsolidated their
financial statements since Monaker s investment in RealBiz went below 50% majority ownership and Monaker was deemed to
no longer have control over RealBiz. Monaker s proportional financial interest in RealBiz is reduced when shares of
Monaker Dual convertible preferred stock and Monaker convertible debt are exchanged for RealBiz shares of common stock. Since
July 14, 2014, the holders of Series D Preferred Stock shares of the Company may elect to convert all or any part of such
holder s shares into common stock of the Company at the stated value of $12.50 per share on a one-for-one basis, or
they may elect to convert the Series D Preferred Stock shares into shares of common stock of RealBiz stock at $0.15 per
share. To honor the conversion of the Company s Series D Preferred Stock shares into RealBiz shares of common stock,
the Company redeems, one-for-one, shares of RealBiz Series A Preferred Stock shares held as investment and presents them
to RealBiz for conversion into RealBiz common stock (on a one-for-one basis). When the converted RealBiz common stock shares
are received by the Company, they are forwarded to the individual/entity requesting the conversion into shares of RealBiz
restricted common stock. 

Monaker continues to own RealBiz
Preferred Series A and common stock and although the two Companies shared similar Board of Directors until April 2016, as discussed
in the following sentence, the companies are operating independently. As of April 11, 2016, the Monaker Directors that were on
the RealBiz Board, resigned as Board of Directors of RealBiz. 

 After November 1, 2014, we use
the equity method to account for our investment in this entity because we do not control it, but have the ability to exercise significant
influence over it. Equity method investments are recorded at original cost and adjusted periodically to recognize (1) our proportionate
share of the investees  net income or losses after the date of investment, (2) additional contributions made and dividends
or distributions received, and (3) impairment losses resulting from permanent adjustments to net estimated realizable value. Accordingly,
we recorded our proportionate share of the investee s net income or loss as  Loss on equity method investment 
on the consolidated statements of operations. 

 At February 29, 2016, Monaker
owned 44,470,101 shares of RealBiz Series A Preferred Stock and 10,359,890 shares of RealBiz common stock, representing 28% ownership
of RealBiz. At August 31, 2016, Monaker owned 44,470,101
shares of RealBiz Series A Preferred Stock and 8,126,630 shares of RealBiz common stock, representing 26% ownership of RealBiz.
This interest, along with a net receivable balance due, has been written down to zero ($0) as of August 31, 2016 and February 29,
2016, to reflect the realizable value of this investment and asset.

notes due from the purchaser. The Promissory Note does not accrue interest, is secured by the 51% membership interest in Name Your
Fee, LLC and will be repaid through 20% of the net earnings received in NameYourFee.com through maturity. The Note contains standard
and customary events of default. The principal amount of the note is due on June 15, 2018, provided that it will not be an event

Note 8   Stockholders  Deficit  

   Preferred stock   

 The aggregate number of shares
of preferred stock that the Company is authorized to issue is up to One Hundred Million (100,000,000), with a par value of $0.00001
per share ( the Preferred Stock ) with the exception of Series A Preferred Stock shares having a $0.01 par value. The
Preferred Stock may be divided into and issued in series. The Board of Directors of the Company is authorized to divide the authorized
shares of Preferred Stock into one or more series, each of which shall be so designated as to distinguish the shares thereof from
the shares of all other series and classes. The Board of Directors of the Company is authorized, within any limitations prescribed
by law and the articles of incorporation, to fix and determine the designations, rights, qualifications, preferences, limitations
and terms of the shares of any series of Preferred Stock. 

 On August 26, 2016, we
converted all of our outstanding Series B (110,200 shares), Series C (13,100 shares) and Series D (110,156 shares) Preferred
Stock, into an aggregate of 444,712 shares of our common stock, pursuant to certain special conversion terms offered in
connection therewith and the mandatory conversion terms thereof.  

Additionally,
stockholders holding 15,000 shares of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and 22,000 shares of our Series D Convertible
Preferred Stock requested the conversion of such shares into 2,233,260 shares of RealBiz common stock. Pursuant to the
customary practice of the Company and RealBiz, the Company first requested that RealBiz s transfer agent, convert
shares of RealBiz Preferred A, owned by the Company, into RealBiz common stock as provided by the RealBiz preferred share
agreement. This request was denied by RealBiz and RealBiz s transfer agent. The Company then requested that the
Company s transfer agent cancel the converted shares and that RealBiz s transfer agent which is also
Monaker s transfer agent (American Stock Transfer) transfer shares of common stock of RealBiz held by the Company to
such shareholders to satisfy the conversion obligations. To date, RealBiz has refused to recognize or effect the transfers.
The Company has provided to RealBiz and American Stock Transfer all necessary documents and affidavits to execute the
transfer and we are currently discussing filing a lawsuit against RealBiz and American Stock Transfer in an effort to force
them to recognize and effect the requested transfers. The Preferred Stock Series B and D shares related to the conversion
into RealBiz common shares have been retired and the number of shares of investment in RealBiz common stock have been reduced
by 2,233,260 shares. 

 All Preferred Stock Series B,
C and D shares have been retired. 

   Series A Preferred Stock   

 The Company has authorized and
designated 3,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock as Series A 10% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share
(the  Series A Preferred Stock ). The holders of record of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
vote on all matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Company and shall be entitled to one hundred (100) votes for
each share of Series A Preferred Stock. 

 Per the terms of the Amended and Restated
Certificate of Designations, subject to the availability of authorized and unissued shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the holders
of Series A Preferred Stock may, by written notice to the Company: 

elect to convert all or any part of such holder s shares of Series A Preferred Stock into common stock at a conversion rate of the lower of:   

(a) $25.00 per share; or   

(b) at the lowest price the Company has issued stock as part of a financing.   

convert all or part of such holder s shares (excluding any shares issued pursuant to conversion of unpaid dividends) into debt obligations of the Company, secured by a security interest in all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, at a rate of $25.00 of debt for each share of Series A Preferred Stock.   

On July 9, 2013, the Company amended
the Certificate of Designations for the Company s Series A Preferred Stock to grant to a holder of the Series A Preferred
Stock the option to: 

elect to convert all or any part of such holder s shares of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of the Company s Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.00001 per share ( Series C Preferred Stock ), at a conversion rate of five (5) shares of Series A Preferred Stock for every one (1) share of Series C Preferred Stock; or to allow   

conversion into common stock at the lowest price the Company has issued stock as part of a financing to include all financings such as new debt and equity financing and stock issuances as well as existing debt conversions into stock.   

On February 28, 2014, the Company s
Series A Preferred Stock shareholders agreed to authorize a change to the Certificate of Designations of the Series A Preferred
Stock in Nevada to lock the conversion price to the lower of (a) a fixed price of $0.50 per share; and (b) the lowest price the
Company has issued stock as part of a financing after January 1, 2006. Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 815-40, Derivatives
and Hedging; Contracts in Entity s own Equity ( ASC 815-40 ) became effective for us on March 1, 2010. The Company s
Series A (convertible) Preferred Stock had certain reset provisions that require the Company to reduce the conversion price of
the Series A (convertible) Preferred Stock if we issue equity at a price less than the conversion price. Upon the effective date,
the provisions of ASC 815-40 required a reclassification to liability based on the reset feature of the agreements if the Company
sells equity at a price below the conversion price of the Series A Preferred Stock. However, the reset provision was removed thereby
eliminating the derivative liability as of February 28, 2014. In accordance with ASC 815-40, the Company records the changes in
the fair value of the derivative liability as non-operating, non-cash income or expense. The change in fair value of the Series
A Preferred Stock derivative liability as of August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016 resulted in non-operating income of $0 and
$0, respectively.

dissolution or winding up of the Company, either voluntary or involuntary (any of the foregoing, a  liquidation ),

the Retirement Obligation (requiring the Company to pay out of 50% of all net profits from the Company or 50% of any new funding
received by the Company from September 21, 2012, until such time as the $700,000 of the Company s Series D Preferred Stock

the Company at an effective price per share that is lower than the then-effective conversion price (any such issuance being referred

the current litigation or other legal claims could change in light of the discovery of facts not presently known to the Company
or by judges, juries or other finders of fact, which are not in accord with management s evaluation of the possible liability
or outcome of such litigation or claims. 

 On March 28, 2016, the Company
was presented with a Demand for Arbitration, pursuant to Rule 4(a) of the American Arbitration Association Commercial Rules of
Arbitration, whereby Acknew Investments, Inc. and Vice Regal Developments Inc. (Claimants) are arguing that $700,000 is due to
them, even though they have already been paid said amounts through preferred shares that were issued as a guarantee and which Claimants
converted into shares of common stock. In connection with the purchase of the stock of the entity that eventually became RealBiz
Media Group, Inc. (RealBiz) that then and now constitutes significant operations of RealBiz, the Company issued 380,000 shares
of Monaker Series D Preferred Stock shares with a value of $1,900,000, which was considered the $1,200,000 value of the stock portion
of the purchase price, and was also meant to guaranty the payment of the balance of $700,000. The Company contends that the obligation
to pay the $700,000 was extinguished with the conversion of the Monaker Series D Preferred Stock shares into shares of common stock.
The date for arbitration has not been set and the Company will vehemently defend its position. 

 On May 11, 2016, RealBiz filed
a Complaint against us in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida (Case Number 1:16-cv-61017-FAM)(the
 Complaint ). The Complaint alleges $1,287,517 is due from us to RealBiz, and seeks the recovery of such amount, plus
pre-judgment interest from October 31, 2015 and costs. The Complaint alleges causes of action including  account stated 
and  unjust enrichment . 

 In June 2016, we filed an Answer
and Counterclaim to the Complaint (the  Counterclaim ) denying RealBiz s allegations and claims and pleading
affirmative defenses including  failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted ,  set-off  rights
(including that the amount owed by RealBiz to us far exceeds the $1.2 million amount that RealBiz alleges is due to it),  mistake
or error ,  unclean hands ,  failure to state a claim ,  waiver ,  release ,
 breach of contract  and  rescission of letter addressing partial balance due  (confirming that a letter
upon which RealBiz s case is predicated was rescinded shortly after its issuance and is of no force or effect). The Counterclaim
seeks attorney s fees and costs. The Counterclaim also alleges counterclaims against RealBiz for causes of action including
 unjust enrichment  (we allege that the net amount due to us from RealBiz is in excess of $10 million dollars),  money
had and received ,  business disparagement , and  breach of contract , and seeks recovery of all
actual damages, consequential damages and incidental damages, if any, including but not limited to attorney s fees and costs,
plus-prejudgment and post-judgment interest as well as the full amount owed by RealBiz. On July 7, 2016, RealBiz amended its Complaint
to include a cause of action for tortious interference with contract relating to alleged actions undertaken by us in connection
with an investor relations firm which RealBiz alleges they intended to retain. On September 20, 2016, RealBiz again amended its
Complaint to voluntarily dismiss the cause of action for tortuous interference. We believe the claims asserted in the Complaint,
as amended, are without merit and intend to vigorously defend ourselves against the lawsuit while simultaneously seeking to recover
amounts we are owed. The Company has no basis for determining whether there is any likelihood of material loss associated with
the claims and/or the potential and/or the outcome of the litigation. 

 On June 2, 2016, the Company
paid an arbitration award of $81,572 ($73,959 plus interest of $7,613) to Twelfth Child Entertainment, LLC for a License Agreement
settlement for rights to air programs regarding  Foreclosure to Fabulous  television programming on the Company s
previously owned media business that was sold on January 21, 2016. The Company absorbed this settlement as part of its partnership
commitment with Launch Media 360 which is an investment of the Company. 

 The Company is unable to determine
the estimate of the probable or reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising from the above legal proceedings.

   Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates   

 The
discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated unaudited
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. The preparation of these unaudited financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going
basis, management evaluates past judgments and estimates, including those related to bad debts, accrued liabilities, convertible
promissory notes and contingencies. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates
under different assumptions or conditions. The accounting policies and related risks described in the Company s annual report
on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 23, 2016 are those that depend most heavily on these
judgments and estimates. As of August 31, 2016, there had been no material changes to any of the critical accounting policies contained
therein.

Overview  

 Monaker
Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries have been amassing vacation home inventory in efforts to become one of the world s largest
online marketplaces for the alternative lodging rental industry. Alternative lodging rentals (ALRs) are whole unit vacation homes
or timeshare resort units that are fully furnished, privately owned residential properties, including homes, condominiums, villas
and cabins, that property owners and managers rent to the public on a nightly, weekly or monthly basis. Our marketplace, NextTrip.com,
has the capacity of uniting millions of travelers seeking ALR online with property owners and managers of over one million vacation
rental properties located in over 120 countries around the world. As of August 31, 2016, we operated our online marketplace through
115 websites in 16 languages, with leading websites in Europe, Asia, South America and the United States. As of August 31, 2016,
our global marketplace included approximately 100,000 paid listings on subscriptions and we contracted with over 1.1 million listings
under the performance based listing arrangement ALRs (described in greater detail below). As an added feature to our ALR offering,
we also provide activities and tours at the destinations that are catered to the traveler through our Maupintour products. 

 Our
ambition is to become the largest vacation rental platform in the world with auxiliary services so travelers can purchase vacations
through one site; NextTrip.com (or through other online distributors sourced by NextTrip.com) and to provide the most qualified
inquiries and bookings to property owners and managers. NextTrip serves three major constituents: property owners and managers,
travelers, and other distributors. Property owners and managers pay to provide detailed listings of their properties on our websites
with the goal of reaching a broad audience of travelers seeking ALRs. Listing fees paid by property owners and managers are paid
either in the form of subscriptions that are generally for an annual period, or in the form of performance-based fees that allow
for owners and managers to list their properties for free and pay us a commission for successful bookings; this allows owners and
managers to list their property on NextTrip and pay a commission per booking in lieu of a pre-paid subscription fee. Currently
we are converting owners and managers away from the subscription format into the performance-based format. This is transparent
to the traveler yet more beneficial to the owners and managers as they accept a larger performance-based fee in return for relief
from the up-front subscription fee and lower booking fee. Travelers visit NextTrip and are able to search and compare our large
and detailed inventory of listings to find ALRs meeting their needs. 

 The
global vacation rental industry is large and growing, but also fragmented and inefficient. We believe we will benefit from having
both a broad selection of ALR listings and a large audience of travelers as well as distributors. We believe that the broad selection
of ALRs will attract more travelers and the large audience of travelers will in turn attract more ALRs from property owners and
managers. 

 Monaker is a technology driven
travel and logistics company with alternative lodging rental inventory. Monaker s inventory consists of ALRs owned and leased
by third parties which are available to rent through Monaker s websites. Core to the Company s services are key elements
including technology, an extensive film library, media distribution, trusted brands and established partnerships that enhance product
offerings and reach. We believe that consumers are quickly adopting video for researching and educating themselves prior to purchases,
and Monaker has carefully amassed video content, media distribution, key industry relationships and a prestigious Travel Brand
as cornerstones for the development and planned deployment of core-technology on both proprietary and partnership platforms. 

   Summary   

 Monaker sells travel services
to leisure and corporate customers around the world. Our primary focus is on providing ALR options as well as providing schedule,
pricing and availability information for booking reservations for airlines, hotels, rental cars, cruises and other travel products
such as sightseeing tours, show and event tickets and theme park passes. The Company sells these travel services both individually
and as components of dynamically-assembled packaged travel vacations and trips. In addition, the Company provides content that
presents travelers with information about travel destinations, maps and other travel details; this content information is the product
of proprietary video-centered technology that allows the Company to create targeted travel videos from its film libraries. In January
2016, the Company introduced a beta version of its new Travel Platform under the NextTrip brand. This platform is still under development
and continues to be improved with a focus on maximizing the consumer s experience and assisting them in the decision and
purchasing process. 

 The platform is a combination
of proprietary and licensed technology (described below) that connects and searches large travel suppliers as well as perishing
and alternative lodging inventories to present to consumers comprehensive and optimal alternatives at the most inexpensive rates
to choose from. 

 The Company sells its travel
services through various distribution channels. The primary distribution channel is through its own websites at Nexttrip.com and
Maupintour.com. The second distribution channel is selling travel services to customers through a toll-free telephone number designed
to assist customers with complex or high-priced offerings. The remaining distribution channels are in the final stages of deployment
and include sales on other travel companies  websites and sales through networks of third-party travel agents and travel
portals. 

Monaker s core holdings
include Nexttrip.com, and Maupintour.com along with platforms for vacation home rentals, timeshare rentals and discount travel.
Nexttrip.com is the primary website, where travel services are booked. The travel services include, but are not limited to: ALR,
tours, activities/attractions, air, hotel and car rentals. Maupintour feeds into Nextrip.com by providing high-end tour packages
and activities/attractions. 

 Additional holdings include
a social media/discount travel platform and a 27% interest in RealBiz Media Group, Inc. ( RealBiz ) which was deconsolidated
on October 31, 2014 and written off as of February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015 as an unrealizable investment. 

 The Company owned approximately
27% of RealBiz Media Group, Inc. ( RealBiz ) as of August 31, 2016 which is represented by 44,470,101 shares of RealBiz
Series A Preferred Stock and 8,126,630 shares of RealBiz common stock. In addition, the Company is owed in excess of $10 million
dollars in funds as a net receivable balance due from RealBiz for amounts paid for the benefit of or on behalf of RealBiz. Both
the shares and the net receivable have been written down to zero ($0) to reflect the realizable value of this investment and asset.
On May 11, 2016, RealBiz filed a Complaint against us in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida
(Case Number 1:16-cv-61017-FAM)(the  Complaint ). The Complaint alleges $1,287,517 is due from us to RealBiz, and seeks
the recovery of such amount, plus pre-judgment interest from October 31, 2015 and costs. The Complaint alleges causes of action
including  account stated  and  unjust enrichment . In June 2016, we filed an Answer and Counterclaim to
the Complaint (the  Counterclaim ) denying RealBiz s allegations and claims and pleading affirmative defenses
including  failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted ,  set-off  rights (including that
the amount owed by RealBiz to us far exceeds the $1.2 million amount that RealBiz alleges is due to it),  mistake or error ,
 unclean hands ,  failure to state a claim ,  waiver ,  release ,  breach
of contract  and  rescission of letter addressing partial balance due  (confirming that a letter upon which RealBiz s
case is predicated was rescinded shortly after its issuance and is of no force or effect). The Counterclaim seeks attorney s
fees and costs. The Counterclaim also alleges counterclaims against RealBiz for causes of action including  unjust enrichment 
(we allege that the net amount due to us from RealBiz is in excess of $10 million dollars),  money had and received ,
 business disparagement , and  breach of contract , and seeks recovery of all actual damages, consequential
damages and incidental damages, if any, including but not limited to attorney s fees and costs, plus-prejudgment and post-judgment
interest as well as the full amount owed by RealBiz. On July 7, 2016, RealBiz amended its Complaint to include a cause of action
for tortious interference with contract relating to alleged actions undertaken by us in connection with an investor relations firm
which RealBiz alleges they intended to retain. On September 20, 2016, RealBiz again amended its Complaint to voluntarily dismiss
the cause of action for tortuous interference. We believe the claims asserted in the Complaint, as amended, are without merit and
intend to vigorously defend ourselves against the lawsuit while simultaneously seeking to recover amounts we are owed. The Company
has no basis for determining whether there is any likelihood of material loss associated with the claims and/or the potential and/or
the outcome of the litigation. 

 On February 2, 2015,
the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Jasper Group Holdings, Inc. ( Jasper ) and created a
Florida limited liability company named Name Your Fee, LLC. On May 15, 2015, as required, the Company issued 100,000 shares
of Series D Preferred Stock to Jasper at a stated value of $5 per share for a total value of $500,000. As stated in the
agreement, Monaker received a 51% capital interest and Jasper received a 49% capital interest of the outstanding equity of
Name Your Fee, LLC. Additionally, Jasper contributed $75,000 in proceeds as part of the agreement. On May 16, 2016, the
Company entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement for the sale of its 51% membership interest in Name Your Fee,
LLC in exchange for a Promissory Note, maturing on June 15, 2018, in the amount of $750,000 plus the cancellation of $45,000
in existing promissory notes due from the purchaser. The Promissory Note does not accrue interest, is secured by the 51%
membership interest in Name Your Fee, LLC and will be repaid through 20% of the net earnings received in NameYourFee.com
through maturity. The Note contains standard and customary events of default. The outstanding principal amount of note is due
on June 15, 2018, provided that it is not in default. 

  Sufficiency of Cash Flows  

 Because current cash balances
and our projected cash generated from operations are not sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures,
management intends to seek additional equity or obtain additional credit facilities. However, there can be no assurance that we
will be able to issue additional capital upon terms acceptable to us. The sale of additional equity will result in additional dilution
to our shareholders. A portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain
the right to use complementary technologies. From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, we evaluate potential acquisitions
of such businesses, products or technologies. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

  For the Three Months Ended August 31, 2016 Compared
to the Three Months Ended August 31, 2015  

   Revenues   

 Our total revenues increased 18%
to $176,770 for the three months ended August 31, 2016 compared to $149,267 for the three months ended August 31, 2015, an increase
of $27,503. The increase in sales is mainly due to increased demand for our luxury tour operations in the summer months, which
provides escorted and independent tours worldwide to upscale travelers. The Company has focused its efforts and resources on completing
its platforms for alternative lodging products and has not budgeted marketing funds for revenue growth until such time as it launches
the new NextTrip.com platform. 

   Operating Expenses   

 Our operating expenses include
costs of revenue, technology and development, salaries and benefits, selling and promotions and general and administrative expenses.
Our operating expenses decreased 5% to $885,534 for the three months ended August 31, 2016, compared to $929,951 for the three
months ended August 31, 2015, a decrease of $44,417. This decrease was mainly attributable to the decrease in (i) salaries, (ii)
technology and development costs as costs incurred are for the development of the NextTrip.com and is being capitalized, (iii)
general and administrative as overhead is reigned in and (iv) marketing expenses being deferred until the NextTrip.com website
is fully released. These decrease were offset by an increase in cost of revenues related to the increase in revenues. 

   Other Income (Expenses)   

 Interest expense decreased 91%
to $63,480 for the three months ended August 31, 2016, compared to $693,823 for three months ended August 31, 2015, a decrease
of $ 630,343, which is primarily due to the reduction of notes payables from the sales of non-travel businesses and the settlement
of promissory notes as well as the conversion of promissory notes to equity during the period ended August 31, 2016. 

 Gain on change in fair value of
derivatives decreased to $0 for the three months ended August 31, 2016, compared to $133,896 for the three months ended August
31, 2015 due to the retirement of derivative instruments during the period ended August 31, 2016. 

 Loss on extinguishment of debt
was $ 186,357 for the three months ended August 31, 2016, compared to $0 for the three months ended August 31, 2015. Loss on extinguishment
of debt was in connection with honoring debt obligations related to an entity (Next 1 Network, Inc.) that was sold in January 2016. 

 Loss on legal settlements increased
to $81,832 for the three months ended August 31, 2016, compared to $0 for the three months ended August 31, 2015, primarily due
to the payment of an arbitration award on June 2, 2016. 

 Gain on sales of investment increased
to $133,808 for the three months ended August 31, 2016, compared to $0 for three months ended August 31, 2015 due to the sale of
the 51% membership interest in Name Your Fee, LLC. 

   Net Loss   

 We had a net loss $906,344 for
the three months ended August 31, 2016, compared to a loss of $1,341,527 for the three months ended August 31, 2015, a decrease
of $435,183 or 32%. The decrease in loss was primarily due to a decrease of $630,343 in interest expense which was offset by gain on sale of investments of $133,808 and other income and expense. 

  For the Six months Ended August 31, 2016 Compared
to the Six months Ended August 31, 2015  

   Revenues   

 Our total revenues decreased 44%
to $271,869 for the six months ended August 31, 2016 compared to $485,360 for the six months ended August 31, 2015, a decrease
of $213,491. The decrease in sales is mainly due to a very week demand for our luxury tour products during the first quarter (quarter
ended May 31, 2016) of $95,099 versus $336,093 for the quarter ended May 31, 2015. The Company has focused its efforts and resources
on completing its platforms for alternative lodging products and has not budgeted marketing funds for revenue growth until such
time as it launches the new NextTrip.com platform. 

   Operating Expenses   

 Our operating expenses include
costs of revenue, technology and development, salaries and benefits, selling and promotions and general and administrative expenses.
Our operating expenses increased 57% to $2,443,789 for the six months ended August 31, 2016, compared to $1,557,270 for the six
months ended August 31, 2015, an increase of $886,519. This increase was mainly attributable to the amortization of website development
costs and intangibles and the addition of third party consultants working on the NextTrip.com platform. 

Other Income (Expenses)   

 Interest expense decreased to
$123,397 for the six months ended August 31, 2016, compared to interest expense of $2,708,196 for six months ended August 31, 2015,
a decrease of $2,584,799, which is primarily due to the reduction of notes payables from the sales of non-travel businesses and
the settlement of promissory notes as well as the conversion of promissory notes to equity during the period ended August 31, 2016. 

 Gain on change in fair value of
derivatives decreased to $0 for the six months ended August 31, 2016, compared to $224,000 for the six months ended August 31,
2015 due to the retirement of derivative instruments during the period ended August 31, 2016. 

 Gain on extinguishment of debt
was $97,943 for the six months ended August 31, 2016, compared to $0 for the six months ended August 31, 2015. Gain on extinguishment
of debt was in connection with settlement of an outstanding debts for discounted amounts which were offset by honoring debt obligations
related to an entity (Next 1 Network, Inc.) that was sold in January 2016. 

 Loss on legal settlements increased
to $81,832 for the six months ended August 31, 2016, compared to $0 for the six months ended August 31, 2015, primarily due to
the payment of an arbitration award on June 2, 2016. 

 Gain on sales of investment increased
to $245,958 for the six months ended August 31, 2016, compared to $0 for six months ended August 31, 2015 due the sale of the 51%
membership interest in Name Your Fee, LLC. 

   Net Loss   

 We had a net loss $2,032,967 for
the six months ended August 31, 2016, compared to a loss of $3,905,204 for the six months ended August 31, 2015, a decrease of
$1,872,237 or 48%. The decrease in loss was primarily due to a decrease of $2,584,799 in interest expense which was offset by $97,943
of gain on extinguishment of debt and $245,958 on gain on sale of investments. 

   Contractual Obligations   

 The following schedule represents obligations
under written commitments on the part of the Company that are not included in liabilities: 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

 At August 31, 2016, we had $301,727
of cash on-hand, an increase of $163,783 from the $137,944 of cash on hand we had at the start of fiscal 2017. The increase in
cash was due primarily to draws from the Line of Credit (described below) to cover operating expenses and website development costs. 

 We had negative working capital
of $2,305,474 as of August 31, 2016 and an accumulated deficit of $95,595,324. 

 Net cash used in
operating activities was $2,054,826 for the six months ended August 31, 2016, compared to $951,362 for the six months ended
August 31, 2015, an increase of $1,103,464. Net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the net loss for the
six months ended August 31, 2016 and due to the net loss for the six months ended August 31, 2015 off-set by the increase
in accounts payable of  approximately $900,000. 

 Net cash used in
investing activities was $276,730 and net cash provided by investing activities was $65,000 for the six months ended
August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the costs for third party

Net cash provided by financing
activities increased $1,815,022 to $2,495,339 for the six months ended August 31, 2016, compared to $680,317, for the six months
ended August 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to the net increase of proceeds in the issuance of common stock and the
exercise of warrants of $1,032,764 and proceeds received from the line of credit of $996,000. 

The growth and development
of our business will require a significant amount of additional working capital. We currently have limited financial resources
and based on our current operating plan, we will need to raise additional capital in order to continue as a going concern. However,
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital upon terms that are acceptable to us. We currently do
not have adequate cash to meet our short or long-term objectives. In the event additional capital is raised, it may have a dilutive
effect on our existing stockholders. 

 Monaker is a technology
driven travel and logistics company with alternative lodging rental inventory. Monaker s inventory consists of ALRs owned
and leased by third parties which are available to rent through Monaker s websites. Core to the Company s services
are key elements including technology, an extensive film library, media distribution, trusted brands and established partnerships
that enhance product offerings and reach. We believe that consumers are quickly adopting video for researching and educating themselves
prior to purchases, and Monaker has carefully amassed video content, media distribution, key industry relationships and a prestigious
Travel Brand as cornerstones for the development and planned deployment of core-technology on both proprietary and partnership
platforms. 

 We are subject to all the
substantial risks inherent in the development of a new business enterprise within an extremely competitive industry. Due to the
absence of a long standing operating history and the emerging nature of the markets in which we compete, we anticipate operating
losses until we can successfully implement our business strategy, which includes all associated revenue streams. Our revenue model
is new and evolving, and we cannot be certain that it will be successful. The potential profitability of this business model is
unproven. We may never ever achieve profitable operations or generate significant revenues. Our future operating results depend
on many factors, including demand for our products, the level of competition, and the ability of our officers to manage our business
and growth. As a result of the emerging nature of the market in which we compete, we may incur operating losses until such time
as we can develop a substantial and stable revenue base. Additional development expenses may delay or negatively impact the ability
of the Company to generate profits. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our business model will be successful or that we can
sustain revenue growth, achieve or sustain profitability, or continue as a going concern. 

 We have very limited financial
resources. We currently have a monthly cash requirement of approximately $350,000, exclusive of capital expenditures. We will need
to raise substantial additional capital to support the on-going operation and increased market penetration of our products and
services including the development of national advertising relationships, increases in operating costs resulting from additional
staff and office space until such time as we generate revenues sufficient to support our operations, if ever. We believe that in
the aggregate, we could require several millions of dollars to support and expand the marketing and development of our travel products
and services, repay debt obligations, provide capital expenditures for additional equipment and development costs, payment obligations,
office space and systems for managing our business, and cover other operating costs until our planned revenue streams from travel
products are fully-implemented and begin to offset our operating costs. Our failure to obtain additional capital to finance our
working capital needs on acceptable terms, or at all, will negatively impact our business, financial condition and liquidity. As
of August 31, 2016, we had approximately $3.4 million of current liabilities (an increase of $0.4 million from the $3.0 million
of current liabilities as of February 29, 2016). We currently do not have the resources to satisfy these obligations, and our inability
to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, our ability to continue as a going concern, and the value of our
securities. 

 Since our inception, we
have funded our operations with the proceeds from the private equity financings. Currently, revenues provide less than 10% of our
cash requirements. Our remaining cash needs are derived from debt and equity raises. 

  Recent Significant Funding Transactions  

 On June 1, 2016, we received $90,000 in proceeds from the Donald
P Monaco Insurance Trust (whose trustee is Donald Monaco a director of the Company) and issued 60,000 shares of common stock in
connection with a partial warrant exercise for $1.50 per share. 

On June 2, 2016, we borrowed three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000)
from the Donald P. Monaco Insurance Trust ( Trust ), which was evidenced by a Promissory Note ( Note )
in the principal amount of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000), which accrues interest at the rate of 6% per annum (12% upon
the occurrence of an event of default). All principal, interest and other sums due under the Note is due and payable on the earlier
of (a) the date the operations of NextTrip.com generate net revenues equal to $300,000; (b) the date the Company enters into an
alternate financing in excess of $300,000; or (c) August 1, 2016. The Note contains standard and customary events of default. Donald
P. Monaco, a member of our Board of Directors, is the trustee of the Trust. This Note may be prepaid in whole or in part at any
time, without penalty or premium. On June 24, 2016, we repaid this note. 

On June 15, 2016, we received $187,500 in proceeds and issued 75,000
shares of common stock and 75,000 cashless common stock warrants expiring June 14, 2017 with an exercise price of $1.50. 

On June 15, 2016, we entered into a revolving line of credit
agreement with Republic Bank, Inc. of Duluth, Minnesota, in the maximum amount of $1,000,000. Amounts borrowed under the line
of credit accrue interest at the Wall Street Journal U.S. Prime Rate plus 1% (updated daily until maturity), payable monthly
in arrears beginning on July 15, 2016. Any amounts borrowed under the line of credit are due on June 15, 2017. Amounts
borrowed under the line of credit are planned to be used for marketing initiatives, working capital and to repay $300,000
previously borrowed from the Donald P. Monaco Insurance Trust, of which Donald Monaco, a Director of the Company, is the
Trustee. The loan contains standard and customary events of default. On June 16, 2016, we borrowed $450,000 under the line of
credit. 

On August 8, 2016, we received $225,000 in proceeds and issued 150,000
shares of common stock and 75,000 cashless common stock warrants expiring August 26, 2016, with an exercise price of $1.50. 

On August 26, 2016, we received $280,000 in proceeds and issued
112,000 shares of common stock and 112,000 cashless common stock warrants expiring in August 2017 with an exercise price of $1.50. 

On September 8, 2016, Charcoal Investments, Ltd., subscribed to
purchase 148,000 units, each consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an
exercise price of $2.50 per share and an expiration date of September 7, 2017, pursuant to a Subscription and Investment Representation
Agreement, for an aggregate of $370,000 or $2.50 per unit. 

Item 3. Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  

   Market Risk   

 This represents the risk
of loss that may result from the potential change in value of a financial instrument because of fluctuations in interest rates
and market prices. We do not currently have any trading derivatives nor do we expect to have any in the future. We have established
policies and internal processes related to the management of market risks, which we use in the normal course of our business operations. 

    Item 4. Controls and Procedures.  

  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures  

 We have established and maintain
a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
disclosed in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , as
amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Commission
and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief
Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

 Management, with the participation
of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this
report. As of August 31, 2016, based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, and in light of the material
weaknesses we found in our internal controls over financial reporting as of February 29, 2016 (as described in greater detail in
our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2016), our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded properly,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Commission and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures. 

 In light of the material weaknesses
described above, we have performed additional analysis and other post-quarter procedures to ensure our consolidated financial statements
are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and we have contracted with experts, where necessary,
for assistance in analyzing and determining the proper accounting and financial reporting treatment for various of the Company s
complicated business transactions. Accordingly, management has concluded that the financial statements fairly present in all material
respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as at, and for, the periods presented in this report. 

  Changes in Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting  

 We regularly review our system
of internal control over financial reporting to ensure we maintain an effective internal control environment. There were no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II   OTHER
INFORMATION  

    Item 1. Legal Proceedings.  

 The Company is involved, from
time to time, in litigation, other legal claims and proceedings involving matters associated with or incidental to our business,
including, among other things, matters involving breach of contract claims, intellectual property and other related claims, employment
issues, and vendor matters. The Company believes that the resolution of currently pending matters will not individually or in the
aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. However, assessment of the current
litigation or other legal claims could change in light of the discovery of facts not presently known to the Company or by judges,
juries or other finders of fact, which are not in accord with management s evaluation of the possible liability or outcome
of such litigation or claims. 

 On March 28, 2016, the Company
was presented with a Demand for Arbitration, pursuant to Rule 4(a) of the American Arbitration Association Commercial Rules of
Arbitration, whereby Acknew Investments, Inc. and Vice Regal Developments Inc. (Claimants) are arguing that $700,000 is due to
them, even though they have already been paid said amounts through preferred shares that were issued as a guarantee and which Claimants
converted into shares of common stock. In connection with the purchase of the stock of the entity that eventually became RealBiz
Media Group, Inc., the Company issued 380,000 shares of Monaker Series D Preferred Stock shares with a value of $1,900,000, which
was considered the $1,200,000 value of the stock portion of the purchase price, and was also meant to guaranty the payment of the
balance of $700,000. The Company contends that the obligation to pay the $700,000 was extinguished with the conversion of the Monaker
Series D Preferred Stock shares into shares of common stock. The date for arbitration has not been set and the Company will vehemently
defend its position. 

 On May 11, 2016, RealBiz filed
a Complaint against us in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida (Case Number 1:16-cv-61017-FAM)(the
 Complaint ). The Complaint alleges $1,287,517 is due from us to RealBiz, and seeks the recovery of such amount, plus
pre-judgment interest from October 31, 2015 and costs. The Complaint alleges causes of action including  account stated 
and  unjust enrichment . In June 2016, we filed an Answer and Counterclaim to the Complaint (the  Counterclaim )
denying RealBiz s allegations and claims and pleading affirmative defenses including  failure to state a claim for
which relief can be granted ,  set-off  rights (including that the amount owed by RealBiz to us far exceeds the
$1.2 million amount that RealBiz alleges is due to it),  mistake or error ,  unclean hands ,  failure
to state a claim ,  waiver ,  release ,  breach of contract  and  rescission of
letter addressing partial balance due  (confirming that a letter upon which RealBiz s case is predicated was rescinded
shortly after its issuance and is of no force or effect). The Counterclaim seeks attorney s fees and costs. The Counterclaim
also alleges counterclaims against RealBiz for causes of action including  unjust enrichment  (we allege that the net
amount due to us from RealBiz is in excess of $10 million dollars),  money had and received ,  business disparagement ,
and  breach of contract , and seeks recovery of all actual damages, consequential damages and incidental damages, if
any, including but not limited to attorney s fees and costs, plus-prejudgment and post-judgment interest as well as the full
amount owed by RealBiz. On July 7, 2016, RealBiz amended its Complaint to include a cause of action for tortious interference with
contract relating to alleged actions undertaken by us in connection with an investor relations firm which RealBiz alleges they
intended to retain. On September 20, 2016, RealBiz again amended its Complaint to voluntarily dismiss the cause of action for tortuous
interference. We believe the claims asserted in the Complaint, as amended, are without merit and intend to vigorously defend ourselves
against the lawsuit while simultaneously seeking to recover amounts we are owed. The Company has no basis for determining whether
there is any likelihood of material loss associated with the claims and/or the potential and/or the outcome of the litigation. 

 The Company is unable to determine
the estimate of the probable or reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising from the above legal proceedings. 

    Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

 There have been no material
changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in in Part I, Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended February 29, 2016, filed with the Commission on June 23, 2016, under the heading  Risk Factors , except
as described below, and investors should review the risks provided in the Form 10-K and below, prior to making an investment in
the Company. The business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether
currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described in the Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2016,
under  Risk Factors , and those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the
Company s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial
condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company s
business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. 

We will need additional capital
which may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, which raises questions about our ability to continue as
a going concern.   

 We have very limited financial resources.
We will need to raise substantial additional capital to support the on-going operation and increased market penetration of our
products and services including the development of national advertising relationships, increases in operating costs resulting from
additional staff and office space until such time as we generate revenues sufficient to support our operations, if ever. We believe
that in the aggregate, we could require several millions of dollars to support and expand the marketing and development of our
travel products and services, repay debt obligations, provide capital expenditures for additional equipment and development costs,
payment obligations, office space and systems for managing our business, and cover other operating costs until our planned revenue
streams from travel products are fully-implemented and begin to offset our operating costs. Our failure to obtain additional capital
to finance our working capital needs on acceptable terms, or at all, will negatively impact our business, financial condition and
liquidity. As of August 31, 2016, we had approximately $3.4 million of current liabilities compared to $3.0 million of current
liabilities as of February 29, 2016. As of February 29, 2016, we had approximately $3.0 million of current liabilities (a decrease
from the $12.2 million of current liabilities as of February 28, 2015). We currently do not have the resources to satisfy these
obligations, and our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, our ability to continue as a going
concern, and the value of our securities. 

 We have experienced liquidity issues
due to, among other reasons, our limited ability to raise adequate capital on acceptable terms. We have historically relied upon
the issuance of promissory notes and preferred stock that are convertible into shares of our common stock to fund our operations
and have devoted significant efforts to reduce that exposure (as previously noted, the liabilities have been reduced from $12.2
million as of February 28, 2015 to $3.0 million as of February 29, 2016 and are $3.4 million as of August 31, 2016). We anticipate
that we will need to issue equity to fund our operations and continue to repay our outstanding debt for the foreseeable future.
If we are unable to achieve operational profitability or we are not successful in securing other forms of financing, we will have
to evaluate alternative actions to reduce our operating expenses and conserve cash. 

 These conditions raise substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months. The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America on a going concern basis,
which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly,
the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities
that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The financial statements included herein also
include a going concern footnote from our auditors. 

 In the event we are unable to raise
adequate funding in the future for our operations and to pay our outstanding debt obligations, we may be forced to scale back our
business plan and/or liquidate some or all of our assets (or our creditors may undertake a foreclosure of such assets in order
to satisfy amounts we owe to such creditors) or may be forced to seek bankruptcy protection, which could result in the value of
our outstanding securities declining in value or becoming worthless. 

   The employment agreements
of our officers include limited non-solicitation and non-compete provisions and provide for severance pay upon termination of such
agreements for certain reasons.   

 William Kerby entered into an employment
agreement, dated October 15, 2006 with an annual base salary of $300,000. He may also, as determined by the Board of Directors,
receive a year-end performance bonus. The agreement has automatic renewal periods of four years each, and is currently in place
until October 14, 2018. In the event the agreement is terminated by the Company with notice of non-renewal, the Company is required
to pay Mr. Kerby all salary earned up until the date of termination, plus three months  severance. The Agreement is also
terminated upon the death or disability (i.e., he is unable to perform duties for a period of 120 days out of any 180 day period)
of Mr. Kerby, and can be terminated by the Company for cause (gross negligence, willful misconduct, willful nonfeasance, material
breach, conviction following final disposition of any available appeal of a felony or pleading guilty to or no contest to any
felony) or without cause, and by Mr. Kerby for good reason (i.e., in the event the Company breaches any term of the agreement)
or for no reason. In the event Mr. Kerby s employment is terminated due to Mr. Kerby s death, the Company is required
to continue to pay his salary to his estate for a period of six months. In the event Mr. Kerby s employment is terminated
due to Mr. Kerby s disability, the Company is required to continue to pay Mr. Kerby s salary for the greater of two
years or the period until disability insurance benefits furnished by the Company, if any, begin. In the event Mr. Kerby terminates
his employment for good reason or the Company terminates his employment without cause, the Company is required to continue to
pay Mr. Kerby s salary and benefits for the remainder of the then term. In the event the Company terminates his employment
for cause, Mr. Kerby is due his salary through the termination date. The agreement includes non-solicitation and non-competition
clauses, prohibiting him from soliciting customers and clients of the Company or otherwise interfering with the Company s
employees for a period of six months from the date of termination, and prohibiting him from competing against the Company anywhere
in the United States, for a period of three months from the date of termination, respectively, provided that the non-competition
provision is voided in the event of the non-renewal of the agreement, in the event Mr. Kerby terminates his employment for good
reason, in the event the Company terminates the agreement other than for cause, and certain other reasons described in greater
detail in the agreement. 

Omar Jimenez our Chief Financial
Officer entered into an employment agreement, dated January 21, 2016, pursuant to which he received $175,000 per year until July
2016, when his salary was increased to $250,000 per year, and he is eligible for cash or common stock bonuses at the discretion
of the board of directors. If the agreement is terminated by Mr. Jimenez for good reason (as defined in the agreement) or by the
Company without cause, and other than due to Mr. Jimenez s death or disability, Mr. Jimenez is due two calendar months of
severance pay; if the agreement is terminated due to Mr. Jimenez s disability, Mr. Jimenez, is due compensation through the
remainder of the month during which he was terminated. The agreement includes a one year non-solicitation and non-competition clause
following the date of the termination of the agreement, which non-competition clause prohibits him (without the prior written consent
of the Company which consent will not be unreasonably withheld) from directly or through another person or another entity carrying
on or being engaged in any business within North America which is competitive with the business of the Company, however the non-compete
shall terminate in the event of a termination of employment by Mr. Jimenez for good reason or a termination by the Company other
than for cause or disability. 

 The automatic
renewal feature of the agreements may prevent us from terminating the employment of such officers, the non-solicitation and non-compete
provisions may not provide us adequate protection from such persons competing with us after their termination, and the severance
pay payable to such individuals may make it costly to terminate the employment of such individuals, make us less attractive for
potential acquirers or prevent a change of control. 

   The market price of our common
stock may be highly volatile.   

 Companies trading in the stock market
in general have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating
performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless
of our actual operating performance. 

 The market price of our common stock
may be volatile. Our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including the following:  

Inability to obtain additional funding;   

Our ability to attract and maintain customers and visitors to our websites;   

Our ability to compete in our industry;   

Failure to maintain our existing strategic collaborations or enter into new collaborations;   

Failure by us or our licensors, if any, and strategic collaboration partners to prosecute, maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights;   

Changes in laws or regulations applicable to future products and services;   

Adverse regulatory decisions;   

Introduction of new products, services or technologies by our competitors;   

Failure to meet or exceed financial projections we may provide to the public;   

Failure to meet or exceed the financial projections of the investment community;   

The perception of the travel industry by the public, legislatures, regulators and the investment community;   

Announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;   

Additions or departures of key management personnel;   

Significant lawsuits;   

Changes in the market valuations of similar companies;   

Sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future; and   

Trading volume of our common stock.   

Item 2. Unregistered Sales
of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.  

 During the six months ended August
31, 2016 the Company issued the following unregistered securities: 

   Common Stock   

On April
27, 2016, we borrowed twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) from In Room Retail, which was evidence by a Promissory Note (?Note?)
in the principal amount of twenty thousand dollars (20,000), which accrued interest at the rate of 6% per annum. William Kerby,
a member of the Board of Directors and Executive of the Company, is the managing member of In Room Retail.

   Subscriptions   

Warrant Exercise   

Consulting Agreements   

On September 15, 2016, we entered into a Marketing and Stock Exchange Agreement with Recruiter.com and in connection with this agreement we issued 150,000 shares of common stock at a value of $225,000. In exchange Recruiter.com will provide marketing services and issue us 2,220 shares of Recruiter common stock representing a 1.5% ownership in Recruiter.com.   

On September 19, 2016, we issued 5,800 shares of common stock in connection with a consulting agreement for IR Services valued at $116,000.   

As described above, on August 26, 2016, we converted
all of our outstanding Series B (10,200 shares), Series C (1,000 shares) and Series D (68,956 shares) Preferred Stock, into an
aggregate of 160,312 shares of our common stock, pursuant to certain special conversion terms offered in connection therewith
and the mandatory conversion terms thereof. Specifically, we offered the holders of our Series B, C and D Preferred Stock, the
option to convert such securities into our common stock prior to August 26, 2016, on more favorable terms than the stated conversion
terms of such securities. Our Series B Preferred Stock holders were offered the option to convert such preferred stock (which
has a $5.00 per share stated value) into common stock at a special conversion rate of $2.50 per share of the Company's common
stock (based on the stated value) provided accrued dividends were waived (instead of the stated $250.00 per share conversion price).
In aggregate, shareholders holding 70,200 shares our Series B Preferred Stock agreed to convert their shares into common stock
based on the more favorable optional conversion terms and were issued 140,400 shares of common stock in connection with such conversion.
Our Series C Preferred Stock holders were offered the option to convert such preferred stock (which has a $5.00 per share stated
value) into common stock at a special conversion rate of $2.50 per share of the Company's common stock (based on the stated value)
provided accrued dividends were waived (instead of the stated $12.50 per share conversion price). In aggregate shareholders holding
9,000 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock agreed to convert their shares into common stock based on the more favorable optional
conversion terms and were issued 18,000 shares of common stock in connection with such conversion. Our Series D Preferred Stock
holders were offered the option to convert such preferred stock (which has a $5.00 per share stated value) into common stock at
a special conversion rate of $2.50 per share of the Company's common stock (based on the stated value) provided accrued dividends
were waived (instead of the stated $12.50 per share conversion price). In aggregate shareholders holding 74,156 shares of our
Series D Preferred Stock agreed to convert their shares into common stock based on the more favorable optional conversion terms
and were issued 148,312 shares of common stock in connection with such conversion. 

Additionally, stockholders holding 17,000 shares
of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and 20,000 shares of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock requested the conversion
of such shares into 2,233,260 shares of RealBiz common stock. Pursuant to the customary practice of the Company and RealBiz, the
Company first requested with RealBiz s transfer agent, that such shares be converted into RealBiz common stock, which request
was denied by RealBiz and then requested that the Company s transfer agent cancel the converted shares and that RealBiz s
transfer agent who also serves as the transfer agent of the Company (American Stock Transfer) transfer shares of common stock
of RealBiz held by the Company to such shareholders to satisfy the conversion obligations. To date, RealBiz and American Stock
Transfer have refused to recognize or effect the transfers. The Company has provided to RealBiz and American Stock Transfer all
necessary documents and affidavits to execute the transfer and we are currently discussing filing a lawsuit against RealBiz and
American Stock Transfer in an effort to force them to recognize and effect the requested transfers. The Series B and D Preferred
Stock shares related to the conversion into RealBiz common shares have been retired.
