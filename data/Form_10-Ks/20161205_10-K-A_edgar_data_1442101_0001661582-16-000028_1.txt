PART 1  
   
  ITEM 1 . BUSINESS.  
  CORPORATE BACKGROUND   
 Western Lucrative Enterprises, Inc. was incorporated pursuant to the laws of the State of Iowa on July 14, 2008.  
  Our Business   
 We are a development stage company whose business plan is to develop an online landscape design construction and consulting business to service do-it-yourself individuals and companies who want to beautify their home or business without the cost and disruption of designers / architects / construction workers.  
 Our current business model is built around online delivery using the Internet. The World Wide Web has become an economical distribution channel. We plan to leverage the technological innovations of the Internet to offer our services to clients, to communicate directly with them, to provide consulting and design services, to advertise our designs books, to sell designs ,  and to perform all necessary financial transactions  electronically.  We plan to use the online services of Pay Pal for customer orders.  
 Our plan is to outsource the development of the website and to launch our marketing plan. Initially ,  we plan to commence marketing of our services using Google and Yahoo website CPC programs and through viral marketing, such as blogs, postings on online communities such as Yahoo!(R) Groups and amateur websites such as YouTube . com, and other methods of  getting  Internet users to refer others to our website by e-mail or word of mouth. We also intend to use search engine optimization, the marketing of our website via search engines by purchasing sponsored placement in search result, and to enter into affiliate marketing relationships with website providers to increase our access to Internet consumers .  In our management's opinion there will be a need for design consulting in the do-it-yourself sector of the market once the current housing market returns to more normal levels of activity.  
 Due to financial limitations, our operations to date have been limited to conceptual planning.   We are now considering alternative business directions that can maximize shareholder value such as acquisitions.   To date the Company and its officers and directors have not had any contract or discussions with any target acquisition or with the owners or representatives of any target acquisitions  
  Our Competition   
 See the Risk Factors section of this prospectus for a discussion on the competition we currently face or may face in the future.  
  Proprietary Rights   
 We currently have no proprietary rights. 
  Our Research and Development   
 We are not currently conducting any research and development activities .   
  Government Regulation   
 See the Risk Factors section of this prospectus for a discussion relevant government regulation and the legal uncertainties related to our business activities .   
  Employees   
 As of December 31, 2015 we have no employees other than our sole officer and director and one additional director. We anticipate that we will not hire any employees in the next twelve months, unless we generate significant revenues, raise capital, or make a complete change of course from our current business plan.  
    4  
  Item 1A. Risk Factors   
 Our auditor has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next 12 months. As such we may have to cease all operations and our shares could become wholly worthless.  
 We lack an operating history and have losses that we expect to continue into the future .  There is no assurance that future operations will result in profits  . If we cannot generate sufficient revenues or raise capital, we could cease operations and our shares could become wholly worthless. 
 We were incorporated on July 14, 2008 and we have not started our proposed business operations or realized any revenues .   
 We have no operating history upon which an evaluation of our future success or failure can be made.  
 Our ability to achieve profits is dependent on 
     our ability to raise capital and develop and continually update a functional, user-friendly website;  
     our ability to procure and maintain on commercially reasonable terms relationships with third parties to develop and  
 maintain 
     our website, network infrastructure, and transaction processing systems;  
     our ability to identify and pursue mediums through which we will be able to market our products;  
     our ability to attract customers to our website ;   
     our ability to generate revenues through sales on our website; and  
     our ability to complete an alternative plan such as an acquisition 
 To date we do not have any customers .  We cannot guarantee that we will ever have any customers .  Even if we obtain customers ,  there is no guarantee that we will generate a profit. If we cannot generate a profit and cannot raise additional capital, we may have to suspend or cease operations .   
 The landscape design industry is highly competitive. Many competitors have longer operating histories ,  greater brand recognition, broader product l i nes and greater financial resources and advertising budgets than we do. Many of our competitors offer similar products or alternatives to our products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively in this marketplace. 
 We have not developed our website ,  network infrastructure, or transaction processing systems, and if we fail to raise sufficient capital,  we    may fail to complete our website or become fully operational.   We are contemplating other possible business directions including acquisitions.  There can be no assurance that either our original business plan or a possible acquisition will take place. If we are unable to accomplish our plan or an alternative such as an acquisition, our shares could become wholly worthless.      

  ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.   
 Not applicable since the Company is a smaller reporting company.  
  ITEM 2.PROPERTIES   
 The Company does not own any property at the present time and has no agreements to acquire any property. Our executive offices are located at 1611 E. Racquet Club Road, Palm Springs, CA 92262. This address is the personal residence of our Sole Officer who makes no charge for providing office space to The Company. We believe that this space is adequate for our needs at this time, and we believe that we will be able to locate additional space in the future, if needed, on commercially reasonable terms.

  ITEM 5. MARKET FOR OUR COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.   
  (a) Market Information.  Our Common Stock has been approved to trade on the OTC Bulletin Board.   To date there has been no trading in our shares. No assurance can be given that any market for our Common Stock will ever develop.  
  (b)Increase in Authorized Share Capital.  On November 23, 2010 the Shareholders approved an increase in the Authorized Share Capital from 75,000,000 to 750,000,000.  A Definitive Form 14C report was filed with the SEC on December 17, 2010. 
  (c) Holders.  As of ,  December 31, 2015 there were 42 shareholders of all of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock.  
  (d) Dividend Policy.  We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our Common Stock and do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividend in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends, if any, is within the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on our earnings, if any, our capital requirements and financial condition and such other factors as the Board of Directors may consider.  

  ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA.   
 As a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), we are not required to provide the information required by this item.  

  ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.   
   
 Certain statements in this report and elsewhere (such as in other filings by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), press releases ,  presentations by the Company of its management and oral statements) may constitute  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 .  Words such as  expects,   anticipates,   intends,   plans ,    believes,   seeks,   estimates,  and  should,  and variations of these words and similar expressions, are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. Actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements .  Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, among others, competitive pressures and constantly changing technology and market acceptance of the Company's products and services .  The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these forward-looking statements ,  which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.  
 Western Lucrative Enterprises, Inc. was incorporated on July 14, 2008. As of the date of this document, we have generated no revenues and substantial expenses. This resulted in a net loss of  $  111  ,  127    since inception, which is attributable to general and administrative expenses.  
   
 On August 17, 2010, Due to his impending retirement, Mr. Randall Baker resigned his position as the sole officer of the company and moved to a different State, although unable to participate in any day to day duties he remained as a director. Mr. Neville Pearson replaced Mr. Baker as the sole officer, and was also appointed a director. This information was previously reported on a Current Report on Form 8-K. 

6  

Since incorporation, we have financed our operations primarily through minimal initial capitalization.  
 To date we have not implemented our planned principal operations .   
   
 We do not expect to conduct any research and development.  

 We do not own any plant or equipment. 

 Our management does not anticipate any significant changes in the number of employees in the next 12 months.  Currently, we believe the services provided by our officers and directors are sufficient at this time.  
 We have not paid for expenses on behalf of any director. Additionally, we believe that this practice will not materially change.  
 In 2010, we engaged Millennium Group, Inc. to assist the Company with new business strategies and options. Millennium Group is a consulting services firm owned and managed by Jonathan Mork, 51. A pension plan of which his father, Dempsey Mork, is a beneficiary is the owner of Orion Investment, which owns more than 5% of our stock. We issued to Millennium Group a $10,000 convertible note as a non-refundable retainer to Millennium Group.  We also agreed to pay $400,000 to Millennium if it is able to introduce a major acquisition to the Company.   The note is due and payable to Millennium in two years, and bears a 5% interest rate which shall accrue annually and be payable at maturity. At Millennium   s election, this note and any accrued interest can be retired at any earlier time by conversion into common shares. The note is convertible into 4.0% of the Company   s fully diluted common shares at the time of conversion, with full anti-dilution protection (not adjusted for splits or new issuances). The Company has also agreed that any shares issued under this note will have piggyback registration rights. The Board of Directors of the Company has approved and ratified the terms of this note. 

  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS   
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.  
  (ii) RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   
 The Company has earned no significant revenue or profits to date, and the Company anticipates that it will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. The Company incurred a net loss of $6,182 for the year ended Dec. 31, 2015, as compared to a net loss of $4,375 for 2014 .  From the date of inception July 14, 2008, to Dec. 31, 2015 the Company lost a total of $111,122. Most labor and services have been compensated with issuances of stock and convertible notes payable.  
  Liquidity and Capital Resources   
 The Company has financed its expenses and costs thus far through financing and through the increase in its accounts payable, payments made by others for the company and by the settlement of the payable amounts with shares of common stock of the Company. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had a cash of $0 compared to cash of $0 as of December 31, 2014.  
 For the most recent fiscal year, 2015, the Company showed  a   loss  in the amount of $6,177 and a loss of $4,375 for 2014. The loss in the current year arose from the accrual of interest on the Notes Payable and the accrued Audit Fee. The earlier years    losses are a result of organizational expenses, professional fees and expenses associated with setting up a Company structure in order to begin implementing its business plan.  
 The 2012, 2013 and 2014 audit fees are also accrued and payable to the major shareholder who paid these fees directly to the audit firm. The Company anticipates that until these procedures are completed, it will not generate revenues, and may continue to operate at a loss thereafter, depending upon the performance of the business.  
 During the period from July 14, 2008 (date of inception) through Dec. 31, 2015, the Company has incurred an  
 accumulated net loss of $111,122 and has not attained profitable operations. The Company is dependent upon obtaining  

7  

adequate financing to enable it to pursue its business plan and manage its operations so that they are profitable.  
 (iii) The Company has limited financial resources available, which has had an adverse impact on the Company's liquidity, activities and operations. These limitations have adversely affected the Company's ability to obtain certain projects and pursue additional business. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to raise sufficient funding to enhance the Company's financial resources sufficiently to generate volume for the Company, or to engage in any significant research and development, or purchase plant or significant equipment.  
 Management has been successful in raising sufficient funds to cover the Company's compliance expenses including the cost of auditing and filing required documents for 2015.  
 The Company as a whole may continue to operate at a loss for an indeterminate period thereafter, depending upon the performance of its new businesses. In the process of carrying out its business plan, the Company will continue to identify new financial partners and investors .  However, it may determine that it cannot raise sufficient capital to  
 support its business on acceptable terms, or at all. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any additional funds  will be available on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. As of Dec. 31  ,     201  5  , the company was authorized to issue     75  0  ,000,000 shares of common stock.   

  Commitments.  We do not have any commitments which are required to be disclosed in tabular form as of Dec. 31 ,  2015.  

  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.   
 As a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information required by this item.  
  ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.   
 See the index to the Financial Statements below, beginning on page F-l .   
  ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.   
 Not Applicable.  
  ITEM 9A(T).CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.   
  (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
 Our management, with the participation of our president and chief financial officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our controls and procedures  (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15 (e) as of the end of the period covered by this report (the   Evaluation  Date ). Based upon that evaluation, the president  
 and chief financial officer concluded that as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules  

8  

and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our president and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure since our auditor had to make audit adjustments. Our management intends to work more closely with our auditors to correct this ineffectiveness.  
  (b) Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting    Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-I5(f)under the Exchange Act). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.  
 \  
 Our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2015, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on these criteria.  In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of   December 31, 201  5  , we determined that the following deficiencies constituted a material weakness, as described below.  
   
 1. 
 Certain entity level controls establishing a    tone at the top    were considered material weaknesses. The Company has no audit committee. There is no policy on fraud and no code of ethics at this time.  A whistleblower policy is not necessary given the small size of the organization. 
 2. 
 Management override of existing controls is possible given the small size of the organization and lack of personnel. 
 3. 
 There is no system in place to review and monitor internal control over financial reporting. The Company maintains an insufficient complement of personnel to carry out ongoing monitoring responsibilities and ensure effective internal control over financial reporting. 
 Management is currently evaluating remediation plans for the above control deficiencies. 

 Accordingly, the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company   s internal controls. However, as the Company currently has no business operations of any kind, all  controls  would be theoretical at best. There is no chance of a material misstatement when all the Company does is pay audit fees. 

 This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management's report in this annual report. 
   
  (c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   
 There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 To the Audit Committee of the  
 Board of Directors and Shareholders of  
 Western Lucrative Enterprise Inc.  

 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Western Lucrative Enterprise Inc.(the    Company   ) as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, changes in stockholders    equity and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company   s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.  

 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (Untied States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  

 The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company   s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  
 In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Western Lucrative Enterprise Inc. as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
   
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note B to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses and has experienced negative cash flows from operations, which raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to those matters are also described in Note B to the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

  Notes to Financial Statements  
  December 31, 2015 and 2014  
  ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________  

NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
 A summary of significant accounting policies of Western Lucrative Enterprises, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) (the    Company   ) is presented to assist in understanding the Company   s financial statements. The accounting policies presented in these footnotes conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements. These financial statements and notes are representations of the Company   s management who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The Company has not realized revenues from its planned principal business purpose and is considered to be in its development state in accordance with ASC 915,     Development Stage Entities    .  
  Organization, Nature of Business and Trade Name   
 The Company was incorporated in the State of Iowa on July 14, 2008 and has as a principal business objective of becoming an online landscape design, construction, and consulting service. 
 The Company intends to develop procedures to make the information given to a prospective purchaser as accurate as possible to lead to the highest percentage of successful Western Lucrative purchases. The Company also intends to focus only on items that can be designed without travel to the location. 
 Neville Pearson was being appointed as a Director of the Company on August 14, 2010. Subsequently on August 17, 2010, he was appointed as President, Treasurer, and Secretary of the Company. 
  Concentration of Risk  
 The Company at times may maintain a cash balance in excess of insured limits. However, as of December 31, 2015, the Company has no cash in excess of insured limits.  
  Basis of Presentation   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices, establishing and maintaining a system of internal accounting control and preventing and detecting fraud. The Company's system of internal accounting control is designed to assure, among other items, that (1) recorded transactions are valid; (2) all valid transactions are recorded and (3) transactions are recorded in the period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which present fairly the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the company for the respective periods being presented.  
  Use of Estimates  
 The preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements    estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on the Company   s financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred.  

Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company   s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.

  Cash and Cash Equivalents  
   
 For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all short-term debt securities purchased with maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  
   
  NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  

Accounts Receivable  
   
 Accounts receivable, if any, is carried at the expected net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful accounts, when determined, will be based on management's assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivables. If there were a deterioration of a major customer's creditworthiness, or actual defaults were higher than historical experience, our estimates of the recoverability of the amounts due to us could be overstated, which could have a negative impact on operations. 
   
 The Company has been in the developmental stage since inception and has no operation to date. The Company currently does not have any accounts receivable. The above accounting policies will be adopted upon the Company carries accounts receivable.  
   
  Property and Equipment  
   
 Property and equipment are carried at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged against operations. Renewals and betterments that materially extend the life of the assets are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income for the period.  
   
 Depreciation is computed for financial statement purposes on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the related assets. The estimated useful lives of depreciable assets are: 
   
 Estimated 
  Useful Lives  
 Office Equipment 
 5-10 years 
 Copier 
 5 - 7 years 
 Vehicles 
 5-10 years 
 Website 
 / Software 
 10-15 years 

For federal income tax purposes, depreciation is computed under the modified accelerated cost recovery system. For financial statements purposes, depreciation is computed under the straight-line method.  

The Company has been in the developmental stage since inception and has no operation to date. The Company currently does not have any property and equipment. The above accounting policies will be adopted upon the Company maintains property and equipment.  
   
  Accounts Payable and Accrued expense  
   
 The Company has accounts payable and accrued expenses in the amount of $26,015, and $20,211 as of December 31, 2015, and 2014 respectively. 
   
 During the course of the audit it was pointed out that the annual audit fees for 2012 and 2013 in the amounts of $3,750 for each year had in fact been paid directly by the majority shareholder, and the liability of the company to the shareholder was not yet reflected in the professional fees expenses or the accounts payable balance for those years. This situation has now been corrected.

  Revenue and Cost Recognition  
 The Company intends to provide a landscape design and consulting service via a web site. The Company reports income and expenses on the accrual basis of accounting, whereby income is recorded when it is earned and expenses recorded when they are incurred. The Company currently does not yet have a working website; therefore, it has not realized any sales that would require recognition of revenue.  
  NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  
  Advertising  
 Advertising expenses related to specific jobs are allocated and classified as costs of goods sold. Advertising expenses not related to  
 specific jobs are recorded as general and administrative expenses. No advertising expense was incurred for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. 

Stockholders    Equity: Common Stock  
   
 The holders of the Company   s common stock are entitled to receive dividends out of assets or funds legally available for the payment of dividends of such times and in such amounts as the board from time to time may determine.  Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders.  There is no cumulative voting of the election of directors then standing for election.  The common stock is not entitled to pre-emptive rights and is not subject to conversion or redemption.  Upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company, the assets legally available for distribution to stockholders are distributable ratably among the holders of the common stock after payment of liquidation preferences, if any, on any outstanding payment of other claims of creditors. 

The Company has authorized seven hundred and fifty million shares of common stock with a par value of $.001. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, there are 8,505,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.  
  Fair Value Measurements  
 In January 2010, the FASB ASC Topic 825,  Financial Instruments , requires   disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in quarterly reports as well as in annual reports.  For the Company, this statement applies to certain investments and long-term debt.  Also, the FASB ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,  clarifies the definition of fair value for financial reporting, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about the use of fair value measurements.    
 Various inputs are considered when determining the value of the Company   s investments and long-term debt.  The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities.  These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below. 
   
 Level 1     observable market inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 
   
 Level 2     other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, credit risk, etc   ). 
   
  Fair Value Measurements (Continued)  
   
 Level 3     significant unobservable inputs (including the Company   s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments).

  _______________________________________________________________________________________________________  
 The Company   s adoption of FASB ASC Topic 825 effectively at the inception did not have a material impact on the Company   s financial statements. 
  NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  
 The carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value is measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs. The  
 Company had no financial assets or liabilities carried and measured on a nonrecurring basis during the reporting periods. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared. The Company does not have financial assets as an investment carried at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015. 
 The availability of inputs observable in the market varies from instrument to instrument and depends on a variety of factors including the type of instrument, whether the instrument is actively traded, and other characteristics particular to the transaction. For many financial instruments, pricing inputs are readily observable in the market, the valuation methodology used is widely accepted by market  

participants, and the valuation does not require significant management discretion. For other financial instruments, pricing inputs are less observable in the market and may require management judgment. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has assets and liabilities in cash, various receivables, property and equipment, and various payables. Management believes that they are being presented at their fair market value. 
  Basic and Diluted Loss per Common Share  
 Net loss per share is calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 128,  Earnings per Share.  The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period is used to compute basic loss per share. Diluted loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding. Dilutive potential common shares are additional common shares assumed to be exercised. We do not calculate loss per diluted shares to prevent understating the actual loss per share  
 Basic net loss per common share is based on the weighted-average number of share of common stock outstanding since inception. As of December 31, 2015 and since inception, the Company had 8,505,000 common shares outstanding and 9,595,200 dilutive potential common shares.  
 Basic earnings per share are based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding.  Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding adjusted for the effects of common stock that may be issued as a result of the following types of potentially dilutive instruments: 
   
 Warrants, 
   
 Employee stock options, and 
  Basic and Diluted Loss per common share (Continued)  
   
 Other equity awards, which include long-term incentive awards. 
 The FASB ASC Topic 260,  Earnings per Share , requires the Company to include additional shares in the computation of earnings per share, assuming dilution.

 Diluted earnings per share are based on the assumption that all dilutive options were converted or exercised. Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method. Under this method, options are assumed to be exercised at the time of issuance, and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. The Company does not have diluted  
   
  NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  
 effects on common stock as there was no warrant or option issued. Basic and diluted earnings per share are the same as there was no dilutive effect of outstanding stock options for the period ended December 31, 2015. The following is a reconciliation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2015: 

Provision for Income Taxes  
 We are subject to state and federal income taxes in the U.S.  Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740,     Income Taxes,     we provide for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  
   
  The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued the following 32 ASU   s (Accounting Standards Updates) during 2015   2014.  
  Due to the fact that The Company is not yet an operating entity none of these pronouncements have any relevance at this time. Should anyone wish to read further detail, then the full text of these pronouncements can be found at http://www.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Page/SectionPage cid=1218220137102

  NOTE B - GOING CONCERN   
   
 The Company's financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company does not have significant cash or other current assets, nor does it have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern. 
   
 Under the going concern assumption, an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation, ceasing trading, or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations.  
   
 Accordingly, assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. 
 The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described in the preceding paragraph and eventually attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.   
   
 In the coming year, the Company   s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its business, maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the payment of expenses associated with operations and business developments. The Company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital.  
   
 Historically, as the Company has no business revenues, it has mostly relied upon funds contributed by shareholders and associated companies to finance its overheads and research. Management may raise additional capital by retaining net earnings or through future public or private offerings of the Company   s stock or through loans from private investors, although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing. The Company   s failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon it and its shareholders.

NOTE C     NOTES PAYABLE   DEBT DISCOUNTS   
   
 On December 31, 2012, the Company issued two new Convertible Notes in the amounts of $6,000 and $1,500 to Magellan Capital Partners, Inc. and Savile Town Investments, Inc. respectively.  
   
 The chart below summarizes the term of the Notes Payable   Debt Discounts of the Company as of December 31, 2015. The Company is currently in good standing of its promissory notes to Millenium Group, Inc. (   Millenium   ), a California corporation, Magellan Capital Partners (   Magellan   ) and Savile Town Investments, Inc. (   Savile Town   ).  

Convertible Notes to Magellan Capital Partner, Inc. and Savile Town Investments, Inc.  
   
 The Company received service through issuing a total of $7,500 convertible notes to Magellan Capital Partners and Savile Town Investments, Inc. In exchange for the $7,500 notes, the two lenders would have an option to receive a total of 750,000 common shares by fully converting these shares at $0.01 per diluted common shares. 
   
 In accordance with ASC 470-20,  Debt with conversion and other options , as the conversion price of the share is a fixed price at $0.01 per diluted common shares, the beneficial conversion feature or BCF of Notes were calculated based on the intrinsic value. The fair value of the shares at the issuance date, December 31, 2012was $0.52 and the BCF is $0.51 per share. As the total BCF is greater than the total proceeds of the $7,500 convertible notes, in accordance with ASC 470-20 the BCF is limited to the total proceeds of the convertible notes which is $7,500. We recorded the total convertible value of the notes issued to the Company in the amount of $7,500 as a debt discount upon issuance, and amortized this debt discount as interest expense over the life of the note. We recorded interest expense in the amount of $627 for the year ended December 2015 in connection with these Notes.

  Convertible Note to Millenium Group, Inc.  
   
 The original beneficial conversion feature was resulted from a note issued to Millenium Group, Inc. in the amount of $10,000 on August 20, 2010. The note is convertible at holder   s option into 4% of the Company   s fully diluted common shares at the time of conversion, with anti-dilution protection (not adjusted for splits or new issuances), and matures on August 20, 2016.  
 On August 20, 2015, this note was renewed and the mature date is extended to August 20, 2016. No beneficial conversion feature occurs with this note renewal since the beneficial conversion feature had been recognized, and had been completely amortized. As of December 31, 2015, there is $1,091.78 accrued interest which is due on the maturity date of note. 

NOTE C     NOTES PAYABLE   DEBT DISCOUNTS (CONTINUED)  

As of December 31, 2015, the carrying values of our short-term and long-term notes payable are as follows: 

As of December 31, 2015, the future principal payments of the above convertibles notes are as follows: 

NOTE D     INCOME TAX  
   
 The Company did not provide any current or deferred U.S. federal income tax provision or benefit for any of the periods presented because we have experienced operating losses since inception. Under ACS 740     Income Taxes,     when it is more likely than not that a tax asset cannot be realized through future income the Company must allow for this future tax benefit.  We provided a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset, consisting of net operating loss carry-forwards, because management has determined that it is more likely than not that we will not earn income sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets during the carry-forward period. 
   
 The Company has not taken a tax position that, if challenged, would have a material effect on the financial statements for the periods ended December 31, 2015 or 2014, applicable under ACS 740.  As a result of the adoption of ACS 740, we did not recognize any adjustment to the liability for uncertain tax position and therefore did not record any adjustment to the beginning balance of accumulated deficit on the balance sheet.
