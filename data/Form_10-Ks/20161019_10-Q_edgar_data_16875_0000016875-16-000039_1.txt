NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  September 30, 2016 
  (unaudited)  

1      Basis of presentation    
    
  These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Canadian Pacific Railway Limited ( CP , or  the Company ), expressed in Canadian dollars, reflect management s estimates and assumptions that are necessary for their fair presentation in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ). They do not include all disclosures required under GAAP for annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the   2015   annual consolidated financial statements and notes included in CP's   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. The accounting policies used are consistent with the accounting policies used in preparing the   2015   annual consolidated financial statements, except for the newly adopted accounting policy discussed in Note 2.  
    
  CP's operations can be affected by seasonal fluctuations such as changes in customer demand and weather-related issues. This seasonality could impact quarter-over-quarter comparisons. 
    
  In management s opinion, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal and recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly such information. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the fiscal year. 
   
  2      Accounting changes    
    
  Implemented in 2016 
    
  Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis 
    
  In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis under FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 810 Consolidation. The amendments required reporting entities to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities under the revised consolidation model. Specifically, the amendments modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities ( VIEs ) or voting interest entities, eliminated the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and affected the consolidation analysis of reporting entities involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships. This ASU was effective for public entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after December 15, 2015. Entities had the option of using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt this ASU. The Company evaluated all arrangements that might give rise to a VIE and all existing VIEs; no changes to disclosure or financial statement presentation were required as a result of this evaluation. 
    
  Future changes 
    
  Leases 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. The new FASB ASC Topic 842 Leases supersedes the lease recognition and measurement requirements in Topic 840 Leases. This new standard requires recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as finance and operating leases with a maximum term exceeding 12 months. This ASU will be effective for public entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after December 15, 2018. Entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach to adopt this ASU. The Company is currently evaluating the impact adoption of this ASU will have on the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations under FASB ASC Topic 606. The amendments clarify the principal versus agent guidance in determining whether to recognize revenue on a gross or net basis. The amendments are effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt this ASU. The Company is currently evaluating the impact adoption of this ASU will have on the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Compensation - Stock Compensation  
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation, under ASC Topic 718. The amendments clarify the guidance relating to treatment of excess tax benefits and deficiencies, acceptable forfeiture rate policies, and treatment of cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes and the requirement to treat such cash flows as a financing activity. This ASU will be effective for public entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years,  
  
   8 

beginning on or after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact adoption of this ASU will have on the consolidated financial statements.

  4      Gain on sale of properties    
    
  Gain on sale of Arbutus Corridor 
    
  In March 2016, the Company announced the sale of CP s Arbutus Corridor (the  Arbutus Corridor ) to the City of Vancouver for gross proceeds of   $55 million  . The agreement allows the Company to share in future proceeds on the eventual development and/or sale of certain parcels of the Arbutus Corridor. The Company recorded a gain on sale of   $50 million   before tax (  $43 million   after tax) from the transaction during the first quarter of 2016.  
    
  Gain on settlement of legal proceedings related to the purchase and sale of a building 
    
  In 2013, CP provided an interest free loan pursuant to a court order to a corporation owned by a court appointed trustee ( the judicial trustee ) to facilitate the acquisition of a building. The building was held in trust during the legal proceedings with regard to CP s entitlement to an exercised purchase option of the building. As at December 31, 2014, the loan of   $20 million   and the purchase     option with a carrying value of   $8 million  , were recorded as  Other assets  in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
    
  In the first quarter of 2015, CP reached a settlement with a third party that, following the sale of the building to an arm s length third party, resulted in resolution of legal proceedings. CP received   $59 million   for the sale of the building which included repayment of the aforementioned loan to the judicial trustee and recorded a gain of   $31 million   (  $27 million   after tax). 
   
  5      Other income and charges    

6      Income taxes    

The estimated   2016   annual effective tax rate for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , excluding the discrete items related to the foreign exchange loss (gain) on the Company s U.S. dollar-denominated debt and the settlement charge in respect of a corporate legal claim, is   25.17%   and   26.50%  , respectively, compared to the estimate of   27.50%   for the same periods in   2015  .  
    
  The effective tax rate for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , including the discrete items, is   26.23%   and   25.26%  , respectively, compared to   32.92%   and   31.28%  , respectively, for the same period in   2015  .  

10 

7      Earnings per share    
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the number of shares outstanding was   146.3 million   (  September 30, 2015   -   153.8 million  ). 
       
  Basic earnings per share have been calculated using net income for the period divided by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period.   
    
  The number of shares used in earnings per share calculations is reconciled as follows:  

For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , there were   331,553   options and   405,851   options, respectively, excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because their effects were not dilutive (  three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   -   364,014   and   179,988  , respectively).  

8      Debt    
    
  Revolving credit facility 
    
  Effective June 28, 2016, the Company extended the maturity date by one year on its existing revolving U.S.   $2.0 billion   revolving credit facility, which includes a U.S.   $1.0 billion   five-year portion and U.S.   $1.0 billion   one-year plus one-year term-out portion. The maturity date on the U.S.   $1.0 billion   one-year plus one-year term-out portion has been extended to June 28, 2018; the maturity date on the U.S.   $1.0 billion   five-year portion was extended to June 28, 2021.   
    
  Commercial paper program 
    
  The Company has a commercial paper program which enables it to issue commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of U.S.   $1.0 billion   in the form of unsecured promissory notes. The commercial paper is backed by the U.S.   $1.0 billion   one-year plus one-year term-out portion of the revolving credit facility.   As at September 30, 2016  , the Company had total commercial paper borrowings of U.S.   $280 million   (  $367 million  ), presented in  Long-term debt maturing within one year  on the Interim Consolidated Balance Sheets (December 31, 2015 - $  nil  ). The weighted-average interest rate on these borrowings was   0.75%  .  
    
  The Company presents issuances and repayments of commercial paper in the Interim Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows on a net basis, all of which have a maturity of   less than 90 days  .  

9      Shareholders' equity    
    
  On April 20, 2016, the Company announced a new normal course issuer bid ("bid"), commencing May 2, 2016 to May 1, 2017, to purchase up to   6.91 million   of its outstanding Common Shares for cancellation. The Company completed the bid on September 28, 2016.  
    
  All purchases are made in accordance with the bid at prevalent market prices plus brokerage fees, or such other prices that may be permitted by the Toronto Stock Exchange, with consideration allocated to share capital up to the average carrying amount of the shares, and any excess allocated to Retained earnings. The following table provides activities under the share repurchase program: 

(1)    Includes shares repurchased but not yet canceled at quarter end.  
   (2)    Includes brokerage fees.  

11 

10      Financial instruments    
    
  A.   Fair values of financial instruments 
    
  The Company categorizes its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in line with the fair value hierarchy established by GAAP that prioritizes, with respect to reliability, the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. This hierarchy consists of three broad levels. Level 1 inputs consist of quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and give the highest priority to these inputs. Level 2 and 3 inputs are based on significant other observable inputs and significant unobservable inputs, respectively, and give lower priority to these inputs.  
    
  When possible, the estimated fair value is based on quoted market prices and, if not available, estimates from third party brokers. For non-exchange traded derivatives classified in Level 2, the Company uses standard valuation techniques to calculate fair value. Primary inputs to these techniques include observable market prices (interest, foreign exchange ( FX ) and commodity) and volatility, depending on the type of derivative and nature of the underlying risk. The Company uses inputs and data used by willing market participants when valuing derivatives and considers its own credit default swap spread as well as those of its counterparties in its determination of fair value. 
    
  The carrying values of financial instruments equal or approximate their fair values with the exception of long-term debt which has a fair value of approximately   $10,553 million   at   September 30, 2016   (December 31, 2015 -   $9,750 million  ) and a carrying value of   $8,879   million at   September 30, 2016   (December 31, 2015 -   $8,957 million  ). The estimated fair value of current and long-term borrowings has been determined based on market information where available, or by discounting future payments of interest and principal at estimated interest rates expected to be available to the Company at period end. All derivatives and long-term debt are classified as Level 2. 
    
  B.   Financial risk management 
    
  Derivative financial instruments 
    
  Derivative financial instruments may be used to selectively reduce volatility associated with fluctuations in interest rates, FX rates, the price of fuel and stock-based compensation expense. Where derivatives are designated as hedging instruments, the relationship between the hedging instruments and their associated hedged items is documented, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for the use of the hedging instruments. This documentation includes linking the derivatives that are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the Interim Consolidated Balance Sheets, commitments or forecasted transactions. At the time a derivative contract is entered into, and at least quarterly thereafter, an assessment is made whether the derivative item is effective in offsetting the changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged items. The derivative qualifies for hedge accounting treatment if it is effective in substantially mitigating the risk it was designed to address. 
    
  It is not the Company s intent to use financial derivatives or commodity instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
    
  FX management 
    
  The Company conducts business transactions and owns assets in both Canada and the United States. As a result, the Company is exposed to fluctuations in value of financial commitments, assets, liabilities, income or cash flows due to changes in FX rates. The Company may enter into FX risk management transactions primarily to manage fluctuations in the exchange rate between Canadian and U.S. currencies. FX exposure is primarily mitigated through natural offsets created by revenues, expenditures and balance sheet positions incurred in the same currency. Where appropriate, the Company may negotiate with customers and suppliers to reduce the net exposure. 
    
  Net investment hedge 
    
  The FX gains and losses on long-term debt are mainly unrealized and can only be realized when U.S. dollar denominated long-term debt matures or is settled. The Company also has long-term FX exposure on its investment in U.S. affiliates. The majority of the Company s U.S. dollar denominated long-term debt has been designated as a hedge of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries. This designation has the effect of mitigating volatility on net income by offsetting long-term FX gains and losses on U.S. dollar denominated long-term debt and gains and losses on its net investment. The effective portion recognized in  Other comprehensive income  for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was an unrealized FX loss of   $72 million   and an unrealized FX gain of   $260 million  , respectively (  three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   - unrealized FX loss of   $291 million   and   $589 million  , respectively). There was   no   ineffectiveness during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Interest rate management 
    
  The Company is exposed to interest rate risk, which is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will vary as a result of changes in market interest rates. In order to manage funding needs or capital structure goals, the Company  
  
   12 

enters into debt or capital lease agreements that are subject to either fixed market interest rates set at the time of issue or floating rates determined by on-going market conditions. Debt subject to variable interest rates exposes the Company to variability in interest expense, while debt subject to fixed interest rates exposes the Company to variability in the fair value of debt. 
    
  To manage interest rate exposure, the Company accesses diverse sources of financing and manages borrowings in line with a targeted range of capital structure, debt ratings, liquidity needs, maturity schedule, and currency and interest rate profiles. In anticipation of future debt issuances, the Company may enter into forward rate agreements, that are designated as cash flow hedges, to substantially lock in all or a portion of the effective future interest expense. The Company may also enter into swap agreements, designated as fair value hedges, to manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt.  
    
  Forward starting swaps 
    
  As at December 31, 2015, the Company had forward starting floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements ( forward starting swaps ) totaling a notional U.S.   $700 million   to fix the benchmark rate on cash flows associated with highly probable forecasted issuances of long-term notes. The effective portion of changes in fair value on the forward starting swaps is recorded in  Accumulated other comprehensive loss , net of tax, as cash flow hedges until the highly probable forecasted notes are issued. Subsequent to the notes issuance, amounts in  Accumulated other comprehensive loss  are reclassified to  Net interest expense .  
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company rolled the notional U.S.   $700 million   forward starting swaps. The Company de-designated the hedging relationship for U.S.   $700 million   of forward starting swaps. The Company did not cash settle these swaps. There was no ineffectiveness to record upon de-designation. 
    
  Concurrently the Company re-designated the forward starting swaps totaling U.S.   $700 million   to fix the benchmark rate on cash flows associated with a highly probable forecasted debt issuance of long-term notes.  
    
  As at   September 30, 2016  , the total fair value loss of   $144 million   (  December 31, 2015   - fair value loss of   $60 million  ) derived from the forward starting swaps was included in  Accounts payable and accrued liabilities . Changes in fair value from the forward starting swaps for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was $  nil   and a loss of   $84 million  , respectively (  three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   - a loss of   $46 million   and   $85 million  , respectively). The effective portion for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was $  nil   and a loss of   $82 million  , respectively (  three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   - a fair value loss of   $45 million   and   $82 million  , respectively) and is recorded in  Other comprehensive income . For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the ineffective portion was $  nil   and a   $2 million   loss, respectively (  three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   -   $1 million   and   $3 million   loss, respectively) and is recorded to  Net interest expense  on the Interim Consolidated Statements of Income.  
    
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , a loss of   $3 million   and   $8 million  , respectively, related to previous forward starting swap hedges have been amortized to  Net interest expense  (  three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   - a loss of   $1 million   and   $4 million  , respectively). The Company expects that during the next 12 months   $11 million   of losses will be amortized to  Net interest expense .

  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had several stock-based compensation plans, including stock option plans, various cash settled liability plans and an employee stock savings plan. These plans resulted in an expense for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   of   $31 million   and   $46 million  , respectively (  three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   - expense of   $21 million   and   $45 million  , respectively).   
    
  Regular options 
    
  In the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , under CP s stock option plans, the Company issued   402,331   regular options at the weighted average price of   $165.55   per share, based on the closing price on the grant date.   
    
  Pursuant to the employee plan, these regular options may be exercised upon vesting, which is between   12 months   and   48 months   after the grant date, and will expire after   10 years  .  

13 

Under the fair value method, the fair value of the regular options at the grant date was approximately   $16 million  . The weighted average fair value assumptions were approximately: 

(1)    Represents the period of time that awards are expected to be outstanding. Historical data on exercise behaviour, or when available, specific expectations regarding future exercise behaviour, were used to estimate the expected life of the option. 
   (2)    Based on the implied yield available on zero-coupon government issues with an equivalent remaining term at the time of the grant. 
   (3)    Based on the historical stock price volatility of the Company s stock over a period commensurate with the expected term of the option.  
   (4)    Determined by the current annual dividend at the time of grant. The Company does not employ different dividend yields throughout the contractual term of the option. On April 20, 2016, the Company announced an increase in its quarterly dividend to   $0.50   per share, representing   $2.00   on an annual basis.  
   (5)    The Company estimated forfeitures based on past experience. This rate is monitored on a periodic basis. 
    
  Performance share unit ( PSU ) plan 
    
  In the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company issued   147,157   PSUs with a grant date fair value of approximately   $24 million  . These units attract dividend equivalents in the form of additional units based on the dividends paid on the Company s Common Shares. PSUs vest and are settled in cash, or in CP Common Shares, approximately three years after the grant date, contingent upon CP s performance ("performance factor"). The fair value of PSUs is measured periodically until settlement, using a latticed-based valuation model.  
    
  The performance period for PSUs issued in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   is January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018. The performance factors for these PSUs are Operating Ratio, Return on Invested Capital, Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") compared to the S P/TSX 60 Index, and TSR compared to Class I railways.  
    
  The performance period for the PSUs issued in the fourth quarter of 2012 and in 2013 was January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2015. The performance factors for these PSUs were Operating Ratio, Free cash flow, TSR compared to the S P/TSX 60 index, TSR compared to Class I railways. All performance factors met the   200%   payout thresholds, in effect resulting in a target payout of   200%   on   300,095   total outstanding awards as at December 31, 2015. A payout of   $79 million   on   217,179   outstanding awards occurred on December 31, 2015 and was calculated using the Company's average share price using the last   30   trading days preceding December 31, 2015. In the first quarter of 2016, final payouts occurred on the total outstanding awards, including dividends reinvested, totaling   $31 million   on   83,563   outstanding awards. 
    
  Deferred share unit ( DSU ) plan 
    
  In the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company granted   27,400   DSUs with a grant date fair value of approximately   $5 million  . DSUs vest over various periods of up to   48 months   and are only redeemable for a specified period after employment is terminated. An expense to income for DSUs is recognized over the vesting period for both the initial subscription price and the change in value between reporting periods.  

14 

12      Pension and other benefits    
    
  In the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company made contributions of   $4 million   and   $38 million  , respectively (  three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   -   $20 million   and   $61 million  , respectively), to its defined benefit pension plans. The elements of net periodic benefit cost for defined benefit pension plans and other benefits recognized in the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   included the following components: 

13      Contingencies    
    
  In the normal course of its operations, the Company becomes involved in various legal actions, including claims relating to injuries and damage to property. The Company maintains provisions it considers to be adequate for such actions. While the final outcome with respect to actions outstanding or pending at   September 30, 2016   cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of management that their resolution will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 
    
  Legal proceedings related to Lac-M gantic rail accident 
    
  On July 6, 2013, a train carrying crude oil operated by Montreal Maine and Atlantic Railway ( MMA ) or a subsidiary, Montreal Maine   Atlantic Canada Co. ( MMAC  and collectively the  MMA Group ) derailed and exploded in Lac-M gantic, Quebec. The accident occurred on a section of railway owned by the MMA Group. The previous day CP had interchanged the train to the MMA Group, and after the interchange, the MMA Group exclusively controlled the train. 
  Following this incident, Quebec's Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks (the "Minister") ordered the named parties to recover the contaminants and to clean up the derailment site. On August 14, 2013, the Minister added CP as a party (the  Amended Cleanup Order ). CP appealed the Amended Cleanup Order to the Administrative Tribunal of Quebec. Those proceedings are pending. Directly related to that matter, on July 6, 2015, the Province of Quebec sued CP in Quebec Superior Court claiming   $409 million   in derailment damages, including cleanup costs. The province alleges that CP exercised custody or control over the crude oil lading and that CP was otherwise negligent. Therefore, CP is said to be solidarily (joint and severally) liable with third parties responsible for the accident. The province s lawsuit was stayed until September 12, 2016, but has since been reactivated. The province has filed a motion for leave to amend its complaint, which motion will be heard by the court on November 8, 2016. Otherwise, no timetable governing the conduct of this lawsuit has been ordered by the Quebec Superior Court. On July 5, 2016, the Minister served a Notice of Claim for nearly   $95 million   of compensation spent on cleanup, alleging that CP refused or neglected to undertake the work. On September 6, 2016, CP filed a contestation of the Notice of Claim with the Administrative Tribunal of Quebec. These proceedings appear to be duplicative of the administrative proceedings.   
  A class action lawsuit has also been filed in the Quebec Superior Court on behalf of persons and entities residing in, owning or leasing property in, operating a business in or physically present in Lac-M gantic at the time of the derailment (the  Class Action ). That lawsuit seeks derailment damages, including for wrongful death, personal injury, and property harm. On August 16, 2013, CP  
  
   15 

was added as a defendant. On May 8, 2015, the Quebec Superior Court authorized (certified) the Class Action against CP, the shipper - Western Petroleum, and the shipper s parent - World Fuel Services (collectively, the  World Fuel Entities ). The World Fuel Entities have since settled. The plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to amend their complaint, which motion will be heard by the court on November 10, 2016. Otherwise, the court has set no timetable to govern the conduct of this lawsuit. 
  On July 4, 2016,   eight   subrogated insurers served CP with claims of approximately   $16 million  . On July 11, 2016,   two   additional subrogated insurers served CP with claims of approximately   $3 million  . The lawsuits do not identify the parties to which the insurers are subrogated, and therefore the extent of claim overlap and the extent that claims will be satisfied after proof of claim review and distribution from the Plans, referred to below, is difficult to determine. 
  In the wake of the derailment and ensuing litigation, MMAC filed for bankruptcy in Canada (the  Canadian Proceeding ) and MMA filed for bankruptcy in the United States (the  U.S. Proceeding ). Plans of arrangement have been approved in both the Canadian Proceeding and the U.S. Proceeding (the  Plans ). These Plans provide for the distribution of a fund of approximately   $440 million   amongst those claiming derailment damages. The Plans also provide settling parties broadly worded third-party releases and injunctions preventing lawsuits against settlement contributors. CP has not settled and therefore will not benefit from those provisions.  Both Plans do, however, contain judgment reduction provisions, affording CP a credit for the greater of (i) the settlement monies received by the plaintiff(s), or (ii) the amount, in contribution or indemnity, that CP would have been entitled to charge against third parties other than MMA and MMAC, but for the Plans' releases and injunctions. CP may also have judgment reduction rights, as part of the contribution/indemnification credit, for the fault of the MMA Group. Finally, the Plans provide for a potential re-allocation of the MMA Group s liability among plaintiffs and CP, the only non-settling party. 
  An Adversary Proceeding filed by the MMA U.S. bankruptcy trustee (now, estate representative) against CP, Irving Oil, and the World Fuel Entities accuses CP of failing to ensure that World Fuel Entities or Irving Oil properly classified the oil lading and of not refusing to ship the misclassified oil as packaged. The estate representative has since settled with the World Fuel Entities and Irving Oil and now bases CP misfeasance on the railroad s failure to abide in North Dakota by a Canadian regulation. That regulation  supposedly would have caused the railroads to not move the crude oil train because an inaccurate classification was supposedly suspected. In a recently amended complaint, the estate representative named a CP affiliate, Soo Line Railroad Company ("Soo Line"), and asserts that CP and Soo Line breached terms or warranties allegedly contained in the bill of lading.  
  In response to one of CP s motions to withdraw the Adversary Proceedings bankruptcy reference, the estate representative maintained that Canadian law rather than U.S. law controlled. The Article III court that heard the motion found that if U.S. federal regulations governed, the case was not complex enough to warrant withdrawal. Before the bankruptcy court, CP moved to dismiss for want of personal jurisdiction, but the court denied the motion because CP had participated in the bankruptcy proceedings.  CP and Soo Line will respond to the estate representative's recently amended complaint during the fourth quarter of 2016. 
  Lac-M gantic residents and wrongful death representatives commenced a class action and a mass action in Texas and wrongful death and personal injury actions in Illinois and Maine. CP removed all of these lawsuits to federal court, and a federal court thereafter consolidated those cases in Maine. These actions generally charge CP with misclassification and mis-packaging (that is, using inappropriate DOT-111 tank cars) negligence.  On CP's motion, made on September 28, 2016, the Maine court dismissed all wrongful death and personal injury actions on several grounds. If the ruling is upheld on any appeal that might be brought, these cases will be litigated, if anywhere, in Canada. 
  CP has received   two   damage to cargo notices of claims from the shipper of the oil, Western Petroleum. Western Petroleum submitted U.S. and Canadian notices of claims for the same damages and under the Carmack Amendment (49 U.S.C. Section 11706) Western Petroleum seeks to recover for all injuries associated with, and indemnification for, the derailment. Both jurisdictions permit a shipper to recover the value of damaged lading against any carrier in the delivery chain, subject to limitations in the carrier s tariffs. CP s tariffs significantly restrict shipper damage claim rights. Western Petroleum is part of the World Fuel Services Entities, and those companies settled with the trustee.  
  On April 12, 2016, Trustee (the  WD Trustee ) for a wrongful death trust (the  WD Trust ), as defined and established under the confirmed Plans, sued CP in North Dakota federal court, asserting Carmack Amendment claims. The WD Trustee maintains that the estate representative assigned Carmack Amendment claims to the WD Trustee. The Plan supposedly gave the estate representative Carmack Amendment assignment rights. The WD Trustee seeks to recover losses associated with the lost lading (approximately   $6 million  ), as well as the settlement amounts the consignor (i.e, the shipper, the World Fuel Entities) and the consignee (Irving Oil) paid to the bankruptcy estates, alleged to be   $110 million   and   $60 million  , respectively. The WD Trustee maintains that Carmack Amendment liability extends beyond lading losses to cover all derailment related damages suffered by the World Fuel Entities or Irving Oil. CP disputes this interpretation of Carmack Amendment exposure and maintains that CP s tariffs preclude anything except a minimal recovery. Canadian Pacific Railway Limited and Soo Line Corporation, both non-carriers, have moved to dismiss the Carmack Amendment claims, which only apply to common carriers. 
  At this early stage of the proceedings, any potential responsibility and the quantum of potential losses cannot be determined. Nevertheless, CP denies liability and intends to vigorously defend against all derailment-related proceedings.

Legal proceedings initiated by Canadian National Railway Company 
    
  On July 28, 2016, the Company announced that CP and Canadian National Railway Company ( CN ) agreed to settle an outstanding lawsuit commenced by CN in August 2015 against CP, certain of its employees and an officer, alleging misuse of confidential information, without any admission of liability on the part of the Company. The terms of the settlement are confidential. 
    
  Environmental liabilities 
    
  Environmental remediation accruals, recorded on an undiscounted basis unless a reliable, determinable estimate as to an amount and timing of costs can be established, cover site-specific remediation programs. 
    
  The accruals for environmental remediation represent CP s best estimate of its probable future obligation and include both asserted and unasserted claims, without reduction for anticipated recoveries from third parties. Although the recorded accruals include CP s best estimate of all probable costs, CP s total environmental remediation costs cannot be predicted with certainty. Accruals for environmental remediation may change from time to time as new information about previously untested sites becomes known, and as environmental laws and regulations evolve and advances are made in environmental remediation technology. The accruals may also vary as the courts decide legal proceedings against outside parties responsible for contamination. These potential charges, which cannot be quantified at this time, are not expected to be material to CP s financial position, but may materially affect income in the particular period in which a charge is recognized. Costs related to existing, but as yet unknown, or future contamination will be accrued in the period in which they become probable and reasonably estimable.  
    
  The expense included in  Purchased services and other  for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $1 million   and   $3 million  , respectively (  three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   -   $1 million   and   $7 million  , respectively). Provisions for environmental remediation costs are recorded in  Other long-term liabilities , except for the current portion which is recorded in  Accounts payable and accrued liabilities . The total amount provided at   September 30, 2016   was   $85 million   (  December 31, 2015   -   $93 million  ). Payments are expected to be made over   10 years   through 2026.

Executive Summary 
    
  Third Quarter   of   2016   Results 
    
  Financial Performance -   In the   third quarter   of   2016  , CP reported Diluted earnings per share ("EPS") of   $2.34   and Adjusted diluted EPS of   $2.73  , an improvement of   15%   and   1%   respectively when compared to the same period of 2015. Third quarter reported operating ratio of   57.7%   was   180   basis points higher than the same period last year, due to the effects of the gain on sale of Delaware and Hudson South ("D H South") last year which lowered the operating ratio by 400 basis points. Excluding the effects of this gain, adjusted operating ratio of   57.7%   was a   220   basis points improvement from   59.9%   in the same period of 2015, as the Company continued to adapt its cost structure to the decrease in volumes. Adjusted diluted EPS and Adjusted operating ratio are defined and reconciled in Non-GAAP Measures and discussed further in Results of Operations of this Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
    
  Operating performance   - CP s continued focus on asset utilization and network investments resulted in improvements to a number of CP s key operating metrics. The following metrics are discussed further in Performance Indicators of this Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
             
    Average train speed increased by   8  % to   23.9   miles per hour; 
         
  Recent Developments 

On August 3, 2016, the Company and Pershing Square Capital Management L.P. ("Pershing Square") announced the commencement of a public offering of 9,840,890 of CP Common Shares by certain funds managed by Pershing Square. CP was not selling any common shares in the offering and did not receive any of the proceeds from the offering of common shares by the funds managed by Pershing Square. After the closing of the sale, funds managed by Pershing Square no longer own any common shares of Canadian Pacific. 

On September 6, 2016, the Company announced the appointment of Ms. Jill Denham and Mr. William R. Fatt to CP's Board of Directors. The Company also announced Mr. William Ackman's resignation from the Board of Directors. 

On September 8, 2016, the Company announced the resignation of Mr. Mark J. Erceg from his position as Chief Financial Officer effective September 9, 2016. The Company appointed Mr. Nadeem Velani as Vice-President and interim Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Velani joined CP in March 2013 and most recently served as Vice-President Investor Relations. On October 18, 2016, Mr. Velani was appointed Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer. 

On October 19, 2016, the Company communicated a revision of its full-year 2016 outlook, including expected mid-single-digit EPS growth from full-year 2015 Adjusted diluted EPS of $10.10. The change is primarily due to the delayed grain harvest, a dramatic decline in crude volumes and other persistent unfavourable economic factors such as the strengthening of the Canadian dollar since the beginning of the year. Capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately $1.2 billion, primarily due to higher costs associated with a key project. Operating ratio continues to be expected below 59%.  
     
   30 

Previous Developments 

On April 20, 2016, CP announced a new normal course issuer bid ("NCIB") to repurchase, for cancellation, up to 6.91 million of its Common Shares, which received Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSX") approval on April 28, 2016. As at September 30, 2016, the Company had repurchased the maximum number of shares for total consideration of $1,210 million, including brokerage fees. 

On April 20, 2016, the Company announced that Mr. Robert Johnson was appointed Executive Vice-President, Operations. 

On July 19, 2016, Dr. Anthony R. Melman resigned as a member of the Company s Board of Directors. 

Performance Indicators 
    
  The following table lists the key measures of the Company s operating performance: 

(1)    Certain figures have been revised to conform with current presentation or have been updated to reflect new information. 
    
  Operations Performance 
    
  Three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended     September 30, 2015    

GTMs   are defined as the movement of total train weight over a distance of one mile. Total train weight comprises the weight of the freight cars, their contents, and any inactive locomotives. An increase in GTMs indicates additional workload. GTMs for the   third quarter   of   2016   were   59,899 million  ,   a decrease   of   8%   compared with   65,273 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   decrease   was primarily due to lower volumes in the Crude and Canadian Grain lines of business. 

Train miles     decreased   by   14%   for the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . This reflects the impact of lower volumes and continuous improvements in operating efficiency from longer, heavier trains. 

The   average train weight   is defined as the average gross weight of CP trains, both loaded and empty. This excludes trains in short-haul service, work trains used to move CP s track equipment and materials, and the haulage of other railways  trains on CP s network. Average train weight   increased   by   7%   for the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . This   increase   was due to improvements made in operating plan efficiency. 

The   average train length   is defined as the sum of each car length multiplied by the distance traveled, divided by train miles. Local trains are excluded from this measure. Average train length   increased   by   7  % for the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . Similar to benefits to the average train weight, this was also due to improvements  made in operating plan efficiency.  

31 

The   average terminal dwell   is defined as the average time a freight car resides within terminal boundaries expressed in hours. The timing starts with a train arriving in the terminal, a customer releasing the car to the Company, or a car arriving at interchange from another railway. The timing ends when the train leaves, a customer receives the car from CP, or the freight car is transferred to another railway. Freight cars are excluded if they are being stored at the terminal or used in track repairs. Average terminal dwell   increased   by   5  % in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . This   increase   was primarily due to time to assemble longer, heavier trains as a result of lower volumes. 

The   average train speed   is defined as a measure of the line-haul movement from origin to destination including terminal dwell hours. It is calculated by dividing the total train miles traveled by the total train hours operated. This calculation does not include delay time related to customer or foreign railways and excludes the time and distance traveled by: i) trains used in or around CP s yards; ii) passenger trains; and iii) trains used for repairing track. Average train speed   increased   by   8  % in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . This favourable   increase   was primarily due to improved train design and operating plan execution. 

Fuel efficiency   improved by   1  % in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . Improvements in fuel efficiency were a result of increased locomotive productivity, operational fluidity and execution of the Company's fuel conservation strategies. 
       
  Nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015    

Train miles     decreased   by   13  % for the   first nine months   of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . This reflects the impact of lower volumes and continuous improvements in operating efficiency from longer, heavier trains. 

Average train weight   increased   by   5  % for the   first nine months   of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . This increase was due to improvements made in operating plan efficiency.  

Average train length   increased   by   5  % for the   first nine months   of   2016   from the same period of   2015  . This favourable increase was also due to improvements made in operating plan efficiency.  

Average terminal dwell     decreased   by   7  % in the   first nine months   of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . This favourable   decrease   was primarily due to continued improvements in yard operating performance. 

Average train speed     increased   by   13  % in the   first nine months   of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . This favourable   increase   was primarily due to improved train design and operating plan execution. 

Fuel efficiency   improved by   3  % in the   first nine months   of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . Improvements in fuel efficiency were a result of increased locomotive productivity, operational fluidity and execution of the Company's fuel conservation strategies. 
       
  Total Employees and Workforce 
    
  An employee is defined by the Company as an individual currently engaged in full-time or part-time employment with CP. Employees could be engaged in a full-time, part-time or seasonal capacity. The average number of total employees   decreased   by   14  % and   14  % in the   third quarter   and   first nine months   of   2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods of   2015  . This reduction was primarily due to lower volumes, improved operational efficiency and natural attrition.  
    
  The Company's workforce is defined as total employees, plus contractors and consultants. The Company's reduction of total workforce during 2016 has been consistent with the reduction in the number of total employees. As at   September 30, 2016  , the total workforce was   11,827  , a decrease of 1,072 or 8%, when compared to 12,899 as at December 31, 2015. As at   September 30, 2016  , the total workforce   decreased   by 1,774 or   13  % compared to   13,601   as at   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Safety Indicators 
    
  Safety is a key priority and core strategy for CP s management, employees and Board of Directors. The Company s two main safety indicators   personal injuries and train accidents   follow strict U.S. Federal Railroad Administration ( FRA ) reporting guidelines.  
    
  The FRA personal injury rate per 200,000 employee-hours is the number of personal injuries multiplied by 200,000 and divided by total employee hours. Personal injuries are defined as injuries that require employees to lose time away from work, modify their normal duties or obtain medical treatment beyond minor first aid. FRA employee-hours are the total hours worked, excluding vacation and sick time, by all employees, excluding contractors. The FRA personal injury rate per 200,000 employee-hours for CP was   1.94   in the   third quarter   of   2016  , up from   1.87   in the same period of   2015  . For the   first nine months   of   2016  , the FRA personal injury rate  
  
   32 

per 200,000 employee-hours for CP was   1.56  , down from   1.79   in the same period of   2015  . The FRA train accidents per million train miles was   1.00   in the   third quarter   of   2016  , a decrease from   1.08   in the same period of   2015  . For the   first nine months   of   2016  , FRA train accidents per million train miles was   0.85  , a decrease from   1.30   in the same period of   2015  .  

Financial Highlights 

(1)   
    These measures have no standardized meanings prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. These measures are defined and reconciled in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  
               (2)   
    Operating ratio is defined as operating expenses divided by revenues, further discussed in Results of Operations of this Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
      (3)    Excludes deferred income taxes:   $3,591 million   and $3,391 million; and other non-financial deferred liabilities of   $961 million   and $991 million at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 

Results of Operations 
    
  Three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended     September 30, 2015    
    
  Income  
    
  Operating income was $  657 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  ,   a decrease   of $  96 million  , or   13  %, from $  753 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   decrease   was primarily due to a $68 million gain on disposition of D H South in 2015, and lower volumes in 2016. This   decrease   in operating income was partially offset by efficiencies generated from improved operating performance and asset utilization, and higher defined benefit pension plan income of $32 million. 
    
  Adjusted operating income, defined and reconciled in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, was $  657 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  ,   a decrease   of $  28 million  , or   4  %, from $  685 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   decrease   was primarily due to the same factors discussed above for the decrease  in Operating income, except that Adjusted operating income for 2015 excluded the gain on disposition of D H South.  
  
   33 

Net income was   $347 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  ,   an increase   of $  24 million  , or   7  %, from $  323 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   increase   was primarily due to a smaller   unfavourable   impact of FX translation on U.S. dollar-denominated debt and a decrease in income tax expense due to lower taxable earnings along with a lower effective tax rate, compared to 2015. This   increase   was partially offset by lower Operating income and higher interest expense on new debt issued in 2015.  
    
  Adjusted income, defined and reconciled in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, was $  405 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  ,   a decrease   of $  22 million  , or   5  %, from $  427 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   decrease   was primarily due to lower Adjusted operating income.  
    
  Diluted Earnings per Share    
    
  Diluted earnings per share was $  2.34   in the   third quarter   of   2016  ,   an increase   of $  0.30  , or   15  % from $  2.04   in the same period of   2015  . This increase was primarily due to higher Net income and lower average outstanding shares due to the Company s share repurchase program.   
    
  Adjusted diluted EPS, defined and reconciled in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, was $  2.73   in the   third quarter   of   2016  ,   an increase   of $  0.04  , or   1  %, from $  2.69   in the same period of   2015  . This increase was primarily due to lower average outstanding shares due to the Company s share repurchase program, partially offset by lower Adjusted income.   
    
  Operating Ratio 
    
  The Operating ratio provides the percentage of revenues used to operate the railway. A lower percentage normally indicates higher efficiency in the operation of the railway. The Company s Operating ratio was   57.7%   in the   third quarter   of   2016  ,   180   basis points   higher   from   55.9%   in the same period of   2015  . This   increase   was primarily due to the gain on disposition of D H South in 2015. 
    
  Adjusted operating ratio, defined and reconciled in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, was   57.7%   in the   third quarter   of   2016  , a   220   basis point   improvement   from   59.9%   in the same period of   2015  . This   improvement   was primarily due to efficiencies generated from improved operating performance and asset utilization, and higher defined benefit pension plan income, partially offset by lower volumes. The Adjusted operating ratio excluded the gain on disposition of D H South recorded in 2015. 
    
  Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) 
    
  ROIC is a measure of how productively the Company uses its long-term capital investments, representing critical indicators of good operating and investment decisions made by management, and is an important performance criteria in determining certain elements of the Company's long-term incentive plan. ROIC was   14.3%   for the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  , a   20   basis point   increase   compared to   14.1%   for the twelve months ended   September 30, 2015  . This   increase   was largely due to higher income, partially offset by the issuance of commercial paper in 2016. Adjusted ROIC was   14.2%   for the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  , a   140   basis point   decrease   compared to   15.6%   for the twelve months ended   September 30, 2015  . This   decrease   was largely due to lower Adjusted income and the issuance of commercial paper in 2016. ROIC and Adjusted ROIC are defined and reconciled in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
    
  Nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015    
    
  Income  
    
  Operating income was $  1,861 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016  ,   a decrease   of $  150 million  , or   7  %, from $  2,011 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   decrease   was primarily due to lower volumes and to a $68 million gain on disposition of D H South in 2015. This   decrease   was partially offset by: 
             
    efficiencies generated from improved operating performance and asset utilization; 
                
    higher defined benefit pension plan income of $88 million; and 
                
    the favourable impact of the change in FX of $70 million. 
       
  Adjusted operating income, defined and reconciled in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, was $  1,861 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016  ,   a decrease   of $  82 million  , or   4  %, from $  1,943 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   decrease   was primarily due to the same factors discussed above for the decrease in Operating income, except that Adjusted operating income excluded the gain on disposition of D H South recorded in the third quarter of 2015.  
    
  Net income was $  1,215 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016  ,   an increase   of $  182 million  , or   18  %, from $  1,033 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   increase   was primarily due to the favourable impact of FX translation on U.S. dollar-denominated debt and a  
  
   34 

decrease in Income tax expense due to lower taxable earnings along with lower effective tax rate compared to 2015. This   increase   was partially offset by lower operating income and higher interest expense on new debt issued in 2015.  
    
  Adjusted income, defined and reconciled in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, was $  1,101 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016  ,   a decrease   of $  105 million  , or   9  %, from $  1,206 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   decrease   was due to lower Adjusted operating income and higher interest expense on new debt issued in 2015.  
    
  Diluted Earnings per Share    
    
  Diluted earnings per share was $  8.02   in the   first nine months   of   2016  ,   an increase   of $  1.70  , or   27  % from $  6.32   in the same period of   2015  . This   increase   was primarily due to higher Net income and lower average outstanding shares due to the Company s share repurchase program.   
    
  Adjusted diluted EPS was $  7.26   in the   first nine months   of   2016  ,   a decrease   of $  0.13  , or   2  %, from $  7.39   in the same period of   2015  . This   decrease   was primarily due to lower Adjusted income, partially offset by lower average outstanding shares due to the Company s share repurchase program.   
    
  Operating Ratio 
    
  The Company s Operating ratio was   59.5%   in the   first nine months   of   2016  , a   50   basis point improvement compared to the same period of   2015  . Adjusted operating ratio was   59.5%   in the   first nine months   of   2016  , a   180   basis point   improvement   from   61.3%   in the same period of   2015  . These   improvement  s were primarily due to efficiencies generated from improved operating performance and asset utilization, and higher defined benefit pension plan income, partially offset by lower volumes. The Adjusted operating ratio excluded the gain on disposition of D H South recorded in the third quarter of 2015. 

Impact of FX on Earnings 
    
  Fluctuations in FX affect the Company s results because U.S. dollar-denominated revenues and expenses are translated into Canadian dollars. U.S. dollar-denominated revenues and expenses increase (decrease) when the Canadian dollar weakens (strengthens) in relation to the U.S. dollar. The following tables indicate the average and periodic exchange rates when converting U.S. dollars to Canadian dollars for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and the comparative periods in   2015  .  

In the   third quarter   of   2016  , the impact of a   weaker U.S. dollar   resulted in a   decrease   in total revenues of   $2 million   and a   decrease   in total operating expenses of   $1 million   from the same period in   2015  . There was no impact on net interest expense.  
    
  In the   first nine months   of   2016  , the impact of a   stronger U.S. dollar   resulted in an   increase   in total revenues of   $146 million  , an   increase   in total operating expenses of   $76 million   and an   increase   in interest expense of $10 million from the same period in   2015  .  
    
  The impact of FX on total revenues and operating expenses is discussed further in Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, Foreign Exchange Risk.   

35 

Impact of Fuel Price on Earnings 
    
  Fluctuations in fuel prices affect the Company s results because fuel expense constitutes a significant portion of CP's operating costs. As fuel prices fluctuate, there will be a timing impact on earnings. The following table indicates the average fuel price for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and the comparative periods in   2015  . 

In the   third quarter   of   2016  , the impact of   lower   fuel prices resulted in a   decrease   in total revenues of $30 million and a   decrease   in total operating expenses of $8 million from the same period in   2015  . 
    
  Similarly, in the   first nine months   of   2016  , the impact of   lower   fuel prices resulted in a   decrease   in total revenues of $165 million and a   decrease   in total operating expenses of $108 million from the same period in   2015  . The wildfires in northern Alberta negatively impacted fuel input costs by an estimated $9 million without triggering a commensurate offsetting impact to benchmark fuel recovery prices during the second quarter of 2016. 

Impact of Share Price on Earnings 
    
  Fluctuations in the Common Share price affect the Company's operating expenses because share-based liabilities are fair valued. The following tables indicate the opening and closing CP Common Share Price on the TSX and the New York Stock Exchange for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and the comparative periods in   2015  .  

In the   third quarter   of   2016  , the impact of the change in Common Share price resulted in an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $18 million compared to a decrease of $8 million in the same period in   2015  .  
    
  In the   first nine months   of   2016  , the impact of the change in Common Share price resulted in an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $14 million compared to a decrease of $26 million in the same period in   2015  . 
    
  The impact of share price on stock-based compensation is discussed further in Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, Share Price Impact on Stock-Based Compensation.   

36 

Operating Revenues 
    
  The Company s revenues are primarily derived from transporting freight. Non-freight revenue is generated from leasing of certain assets, contracts with passenger service operators, switching fees, transload activities and logistical management services. Changes in freight volumes generally contribute to corresponding changes in freight revenues and certain variable expenses, such as fuel, equipment rents and crew costs. 

(1)     Freight revenues include fuel surcharge revenues of $36 million in 2016, and $70 million in 2015. 
            (2)   
    FX Adjusted % Change does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, is unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. FX adjusted variance is defined and reconciled in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Freight revenues   were   $1,510 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  ,   a decrease   of   $157 million  , or   9  % from   $1,667 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   decrease   was primarily due to a decline in volumes for certain lines of business and the impact of lower fuel prices on fuel surcharge revenue. 

RTMs   are defined as the movement of one revenue-producing ton of freight over a distance of one mile. RTMs measure the relative weight and distance of rail freight moved by the Company. RTMs for the   third quarter   of   2016   were   33,915 million  ,   a decrease   of   6%   compared with   36,138 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   decrease   was mainly attributable to Crude and Canadian Grain. These volume   decrease  s were partially offset by increases in Coal, U.S. Grain, and International Intermodal. 

Non-freight revenues   were $  44 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  ,   an increase   of $  2 million  , or   5  % from $  42 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   increase   was primarily due to higher transload revenues following the acquisition of Steelcare Inc. near the end of the third quarter of 2015.  

(1)     Freight revenues include fuel surcharge revenues of $77 million in 2016, and $246 million in 2015. 
            (2)   
    FX Adjusted % Change does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, is unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. FX adjusted variance is defined and reconciled in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Freight revenues   were   $4,464 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016  ,   a decrease   of   $443 million  , or   9  % from   $4,907 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   decrease   was primarily due to an overall decline in volumes and the impact of lower fuel prices on fuel surcharge revenue. The favourable impact of the change in FX partially offset this   decrease  .  

RTMs     for the first nine months   of   2016   were   100,341 million  ,   a decrease   of   8  % compared with   108,482 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   decrease   was mainly attributable to decreased shipments of Crude, Potash, Canadian Grain, and Metals, Minerals and Consumer Products. These volume decreases were partially offset by increased shipments of International Intermodal, Forest Products and Chemicals and Plastics. 

37 

Non-freight revenues   were $  131 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016  ,   an increase   of $  13 million  , or   11  % from $  118 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   increase   was primarily due to  higher transload revenue following the acquisition of Steelcare Inc. near the end of the third quarter of 2015, and from higher logistic services and leasing revenues. 
       
  Lines of Business 
    
  Canadian Grain 

Canadian grain revenue was   $222 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  ,   a decrease   of   $39 million  , or   15%   from   $261 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   decrease   was mainly attributable to a decline in volumes as a result of wet weather conditions that delayed the harvest of the 2016/2017 crop, as well as lower freight rates consistent with the Maximum Revenue Entitlement for Canadian regulated grain for the crop year 2015/2016. 

Canadian grain revenue was   $677 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016  ,   a decrease   of   $95 million  , or   12%   from   $772 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   decrease   was primarily due to lower freight rates that reflect the decrease in the Maximum Revenue Entitlement for Canadian regulated grain in the crop year 2015/2016,  and a decline in volumes due to lower available supply. This   decrease   was partially offset by the   favourable   impact of the change in FX. 
    
  U.S. Grain 

U.S. grain revenue was   $150 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  ,   an increase   of   $2 million  , or   1%   from   $148 million   in the same period of   2015  . This increase was the result of increased shipments of mostly corn and soybeans, partially offset by lower average freight revenue per revenue ton-mile. The decrease in average freight revenue per revenue per ton-mile is primarily due to the increased length of haul as export grain represented a greater proportion of U.S. grain shipments and the impact of lower fuel prices on fuel surcharge revenue. 
  
   38 

U.S. grain revenue was   $364 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016  ,   a decrease   of   $27 million  , or   7%   from   $391 million   in the same period of   2015  . The   decrease   was primarily due to a decrease in average freight revenue per revenue ton-mile, as a result of a change in the mix of commodities being shipped, and     the impact of lower fuel prices on fuel surcharge revenue  .   The   favourable   impact of the change in FX partially offset this decrease. 
    
  Coal 

Coal revenue was   $160 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  ,   a decrease   of   $3 million  , or   2%   from   $163 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   decrease   was primarily due to lower fuel surcharge revenue as a result of lower fuel prices, and lower average freight revenue per revenue ton-mile, partially offset by increased shipments of export metallurgical coal.  

Coal revenue was   $454 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016  ,   a decrease   of   $36 million  , or   7%   from   $490 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   decrease   was primarily due to decline in volumes of U.S. thermal coal and the impact of lower fuel prices on fuel surcharge revenue. The   favourable   impact of the change in FX partially offset this decrease. 
    
  Potash 

Potash revenue was   $81 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  ,   a decrease   of   $1 million  , or   1%   from   $82 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   decrease   was primarily due to the impact of lower fuel prices on fuel surcharge revenue. 
  
   39 

Potash revenue was   $242 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016  ,   a decrease   of   $39 million  , or   14%   from   $281 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   decrease   was primarily due to a decline in export potash volumes and lower fuel surcharge revenue as a result of lower fuel prices, partially offset by the   favourable   impact of the change in FX. 
    
  Fertilizers and Sulphur 

Fertilizers and sulphur revenue was   $64 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  , an   increase   of   $2 million   from   $62 million   in the same period of   2015  . This increase was primarily due to an increase in average freight rates, partially offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue as a result of lower fuel prices. 

Fertilizers and sulphur revenue was   $218 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016  ,   an increase   of   $18 million  , or   9%   from   $200 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   increase   was due to higher fertilizer shipments and the   favourable   impact of the change in FX, partially offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue as a result of lower fuel prices. 
    
  Forest Products 

Forest products revenue was   $71 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  ,   an increase   of   $5 million  , or   8%   from   $66 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   increase   was primarily due to higher volumes, particularly of lumber and panel products, partially offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue as a result of lower fuel prices.

  Chemicals and Plastics 

Chemicals and plastics revenue was   $174 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  ,   an increase   of   $1 million  , or   1%   from   $173 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   increase   was primarily due to higher volumes.  This increase was partially offset by the impact of lower fuel prices on fuel surcharge revenue, and lower average freight revenue per revenue ton-mile due to fewer liquefied petroleum gas product shipments. 

Chemicals and plastics revenue was   $530 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016  ,   an increase   of   $8 million  , or   2%   from   $522 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   increase   was primarily due to the   favourable   impact of the change in FX and higher volumes. This increase was partially offset by the impact of lower fuel prices on fuel surcharge revenue, and lower average freight revenue per revenue ton-mile due to fewer liquefied petroleum gas product shipments. 
    
  Crude 

Crude revenue was   $13 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  ,   a decrease   of   $96 million  , or   88%   from   $109 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   decrease   was primarily due to a decline in volumes as a result of the fall in crude oil prices and an increase in available  
  
   41 

pipeline capacity, as well as lower fuel surcharge revenue as a result of lower fuel prices. Freight revenue per carload also declined due to a reduction in length of haul following a significant reduction in traffic destined to the north-east U.S. and lower fuel surcharge revenue as a result of lower fuel prices. Freight revenue per revenue ton-mile increased primarily due to the reduction in average  length of haul, offset in part by lower fuel surcharge revenues.  

Crude revenue was   $108 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016  ,   a decrease   of   $180 million  , or   63%   from   $288 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   decrease   was primarily due to a decline in volumes as a result of the fall in crude oil prices and an increase in available pipeline capacity, as well as lower fuel surcharge revenue as a result of lower fuel prices. The favourable impact of the change in FX partially offset this   decrease  . 
    
  Metals, Minerals and Consumer Products

Operating Expenses 

(1)   
    FX Adjusted % Change does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, is unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. FX adjusted variance is defined and reconciled in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
       
  Operating expenses were   $897 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  ,   a decrease   of $  59 million  , or   6  %, from $  956 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   decrease   was primarily due to: 
             
    efficiencies generated from improved operating performance and asset utilization; 
                
    lower volume variable expenses; and 
                
    higher defined benefit pension plan income of $32 million. 

44 

This   decrease   was partially offset by the impact of the gain on sale of D H South in 2015 and by wage and benefit inflation of approximately 3%.

    the favourable impact of $108 million from lower fuel prices;  
                
    a reduction in workload, as measured by GTMs; and 
                
    improvements in fuel efficiency of approximately 3%. 
       
  This   decrease   was partially offset by the unfavourable impact of the change in FX of   $25 million  . 

45 

Materials 
    
  Materials expense includes the cost of material used for track, locomotive, freight car and building maintenance and software sustainment. Materials expense was $  39 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  ,   a decrease   of $  8 million  , or   17  %, from $  47 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   decrease   was primarily due to lower volumes. 
    
  Materials expense was $  133 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016  ,   a decrease   of $  11 million  , or   8  %, from $  144 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   decrease   was primarily due to lower volumes, partially offset by the unfavourable impact of the change in FX of   $3 million  . 
    
  Equipment Rents 
    
  Equipment rents expense includes the cost associated with using other railways freight cars, intermodal equipment, and locomotives, net of rental income received from other railways for the use of CP s equipment. Equipment rents expense was $  43 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  ,    an increase   of $  1 million   or   2  % from $  42 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   increase   was primarily due to lower rental income due to the return of subleased freight cars. 
    
  Equipment rents expense was $  132 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016  ,   an increase   of $  2 million  , or   2  %, from $  130 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   increase   was primarily due to the return of subleased locomotives and freight cars reducing rental income by $6 million and the unfavourable impact of the change in FX of   $5 million  . This   increase   was largely offset by the purchase or return of leased freight cars reducing rental expenses by $10 million. 
    
  Depreciation and Amortization 
    
  Depreciation and amortization expense represents the charge associated with the use of track and roadway, buildings, rolling stock, information systems and other depreciable assets. Depreciation and amortization expense was $  155 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  ,   an increase   of $  6 million  , or   4  %, from $  149 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   increase   was primarily due to a higher depreciable asset base. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization expense was $  478 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016  ,   an increase   of $  38 million  , or   9  %, from  $  440 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   increase   was primarily due to a higher depreciable asset base and the unfavourable impact of the change in FX of   $5 million  . 
    
  Purchased Services and Other 

Purchased services and other expense encompasses a wide range of third-party costs, including expenses for joint facilities, personal injuries and damage, environmental remediation, property and other taxes, contractor and consulting fees, insurance, and gains on land sales. Purchased services and other expense was $  228 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  ,   a decrease   of $  44 million  , or   16  %, from $  272 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   decrease   was primarily due to: 
             
    a reduction in discontinuance costs for certain branch lines, reported in Other; 
                
    lower crew travel and accommodations costs, reported in Track and operations; and 
                
    lower third-party locomotive overhauls and maintenance costs, reported in Equipment. 
       
  This   decrease   was partially offset by higher casualty expenses of $  5 million   due to higher personal injuries costs and more costly mishaps, partially offset by lower loss and damages, reported in Casualty and higher property taxes of $  3 million  . 
  
   46 

Purchased services and other expense was $  690 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016  ,   a decrease   of $  98 million  , or   12  %, from $  788 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   decrease   was primarily due to: 
             
    a $17 million gain on sale of surplus freight cars, and a reduction in discontinuance costs for certain branch lines,     reported in Other; 
                
    lower third-party services cost, reported in Track and operations and Support and facilities; 
                
    lower crew travel and accommodations costs, reported in Track and operations; 
                
    lower third-party freight car and locomotive maintenance costs, reported in Equipment; 
                
    lower casualty expenses of $7 million (excluding an unfavourable FX impact of $2 million) as a result of lower personal injury costs and lower incident costs, reported in Casualty; and 
                
    lower intermodal expenses, reported in Intermodal. 
       
  This   decrease   was partially offset by the unfavourable impact of the change in FX of   $20 million   and higher property taxes of $8 million (excluding an unfavourable FX impact of $1 million). 
    
  As part of optimizing its assets, the Company may identify and dispose of property used or formerly used in operating activities. In compliance with U.S. GAAP, the Company includes as part of operating expenses the gains and losses that arise on disposal of such long-lived assets. The following disposals have impacted Purchased services and other during the current and comparative periods: 
             
    In the second quarter of 2016, the Company disposed of 1,000 surplus freight cars that had reached or were nearing the end of their useful life, in a non-monetary exchange for new freight cars. The Company recognized a gain on sale of $17 million from the transaction and the sale did not impact cash from investing activities. 
                
    In the first quarter of 2016, the Company completed the sale of CP s Arbutus Corridor to the City of Vancouver for gross proceeds of   $55 million   and a gain on sale of $50 million. The agreement allows the Company to share in future proceeds on the eventual development and/or sale of certain parcels of the Arbutus Corridor.  
                
    In the first quarter of 2015, the Company recorded a gain of $31 million following the sale of a building after resolution of legal proceedings, and the Company sold various sections of land in eastern Canada for transit purposes, recognizing gains totaling $60 million.  

Other Income Statement Items 
    
  Other Income and Charges 
    
  Other income and charges consists of gains and losses from the change in FX on long-term debt and working capital, various costs related to financing activities, shareholder costs, equity income and other non-operating expenditures. Other income and charges was an   expense   of   $71 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  , compared to an   expense   of   $168 million   in the same period of   2015  , a change of   $97 million  . This change was primarily due to a smaller   unfavourable   impact of FX translation of   $46 million   on U.S. dollar-denominated long-term debt during the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   $128 million   in the same period of   2015   and a $47 million premium charged upon early redemption of notes in the third quarter of 2015, partially offset by a legal settlement charge of $25 million in the third quarter of 2016. These items are discussed further in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  
    
  Other income and charges was a   gain   of   $119 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016  , compared to an   expense   of   $236 million   in the same period of   2015  , a change of   $355 million  . This change was primarily due to a   favourable   impact of FX translation of   $153 million   on U.S. dollar-denominated debt in the   first nine months   of   2016  , compared to an   unfavourable   FX impact of   $182 million   in the same period of   2015  .  

47 

Net Interest Expense 
    
  Net interest expense includes interest on long-term debt and capital leases. Net interest expense was $  116 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  ,    an increase   of $  13 million  , or   13  %, from $  103 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   increase   was primarily due to an additional $22 million of interest on new debt issued during the   third quarter   in   2015  . This increase was partially offset by interest savings due to principal payments and higher capitalized interest.  
    
  Net interest expense was $  355 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016  ,   an increase   of $  83 million  , or   31  %, from $  272 million   in the same period of   2015  . This   increase   was primarily due to an additional $92 million of interest on new debt issued during the   third quarter   in   2015   and the unfavourable impact of the change in FX of $10 million. This increase was also partially offset by interest savings due to principal payments and higher capitalized interest.  
    
  Income Tax Expense 
    
  Income tax expense was $  123 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  ,   a decrease   of $  36 million  , or   23  %, from $  159 million   in the same period of   2015  . Income tax expense was $  410 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016  ,   a decrease   of $  60 million  , or   13  %, from $  470 million   in the same period of   2015  . These decreases were due to lower taxable earnings along with a lower effective tax rate in   2016  .  
    
  The estimated annualized effective tax rate for the   third quarter   of   2016   excluding discrete items (FX translation on U.S. dollar- denominated debt) was 25.17%, compared to 27.50% during the same period of   2015  . For the   first nine months   of   2016  , the estimated annualized effective tax rate was 26.50%, compared to 27.50% during the same period of   2015  . 
    
  The effective tax rate including discrete items in the   third quarter   of   2016   was 26.23%, compared with 32.92% in the same period of   2015  . The effective tax rate including discrete items is higher than the effective tax rate of 25.17% in the current period due to a tax recovery related to FX translation losses on U.S. dollar-denominated debt assessed at a significantly lower rate. The effective tax rate including discrete items in the prior period is higher than the effective tax rate of 27.50% during the   third quarter   of   2015   due to a tax expense related to the gain on sale of D H South assessed at a higher tax rate and a tax recovery related to FX translation losses on U.S. dollar-denominated debt assessed at a significantly lower rate. 
  The effective tax rate including discrete items in the   first nine months   of   2016   was 25.26%, compared with 31.28% in the same period of   2015  . The effective tax rate including discrete items is lower than the effective tax rate of 26.50% in the first nine months of 2016 due to a tax expense related to FX translation gains on U.S. dollar-denominated debt assessed at a significantly lower rate. The effective tax rate including discrete items is higher than the effective tax rate of 27.50% in the   first nine months   of   2015   due to a tax expense related to the gain on sale of D H South, in the third quarter of 2015 assessed at a higher rate, a tax recovery related to FX translation losses on U.S dollar-denominated debt assessed at a significantly lower rate, and legislation enacted to increase the Alberta provincial corporate income tax rate which resulted in the Company recording an income tax expense of $23 million, in the second quarter of 2015, related to the revaluation of its deferred income tax balances as at January 1, 2015.  
    
  The Company expects an annualized effective tax rate in 2016 of approximately 26.50%. The Company s 2016 outlook for its normalized income tax rate is based on certain assumptions about events and developments that may or may not materialize or that may be offset entirely or partially by other events and developments, discussed further in Item 1A. Risk Factors of CP's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  The Company believes adequate amounts of Cash and cash equivalents are available in the normal course of business to provide for ongoing operations, including the obligations identified in the tables in Contractual Commitments of this Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The Company is not aware of any trends or expected fluctuations in the Company's liquidity that would create any deficiencies. The Company's primary sources of liquidity include its Cash and cash equivalents, its bilateral letters of credit and its revolving credit facility.  
    
  As at   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $103 million   of Cash and cash equivalents, U.S. $1.7 billion available under its revolving credit facility and up to $296 million available under its letters of credit facility (  December 31, 2015   -   $650 million   of Cash and cash equivalents, U.S. $2.0 billion available under revolving credit facilities and up to $225 million under letters of credit facility).  
    
  As at   September 30, 2016  , the Company's U.S. $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, which includes a U.S. $1.0 billion five-year portion and U.S. $1.0 billion one-year plus one-year term-out portion, was undrawn. On June 28, 2016, the maturity date on the U.S. $1.0 billion one-year plus one-year term-out portion was extended to June 28, 2018, and the maturity date on the U.S. $1.0 billion five-year portion was extended to June 28, 2021. The Company did not draw from its revolving credit facility during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . This facility was also undrawn as at   December 31, 2015  . The revolving credit facility agreement requires the Company not to exceed a maximum debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization ratio. As at   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with the threshold stipulated in this financial covenant.

The Company has a commercial paper program which enables it to issue commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of U.S. $1.0 billion in the form of unsecured promissory notes. The commercial paper is backed by the U.S. $1.0 billion one-year plus one-year term-out portion of the revolving credit facility. At   September 30, 2016  , total commercial paper borrowings were U.S. $280 million (  December 31, 2015   - $nil), decreasing the amount available under the revolving credit facility to U.S. $1.7 billion at   September 30, 2016  . As at   September 30, 2016  , the Company does not intend to refinance outstanding commercial paper borrowings on a long-term basis.  
    
  As at   September 30, 2016  , under its bilateral letters of credit facility, the Company had letters of credit drawn of $304 million from a total available amount of $600 million. This compares to letters of credit drawn of $375 million from a total available amount of $600 million as at   December 31, 2015  . Under the bilateral letters of credit facility, the Company has the option to post collateral in the form of Cash or cash equivalents, equal at least to the face value of the letters of credit issued. Collateral provided may include highly liquid investments purchased three months or less from maturity and is stated at cost, which approximates market value.  As at   September 30, 2016  , the Company had posted $nil in collateral on the bilateral letters of credit facility (  December 31, 2015   - $nil). The Company can largely withdraw this collateral during any month.  
    
  The following discussion of operating, investing and financing activities describes the Company s indicators of liquidity and capital resources and financial performance.  
    
  Operating Activities 
    
  Cash provided by operating activities was $  591 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to $  696 million   in the same period of   2015  ,   a decrease   of $  105 million  . The   decrease   in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to lower cash generating income and increased interest payments in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . 
    
  Cash provided by operating activities was $  1,321 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016   compared to $  1,836 million   in the same period of   2015  ,   a decrease   of $  515 million  . The   decrease   in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to lower cash generating income, and an unfavourable change in working capital primarily as a result of higher income taxes paid in 2016 and an increase in interest payments resulting from debt issued in 2015.  
    
  Investing Activities 
    
  Cash used in investing activities was $  278 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  , an   increase   of $  115 million   from $  163 million   in the same period of   2015  . For the   first nine months   of   2016  , cash used in investing activities was $  817 million  , an   increase   of $  109 million   from $  708 million   in the same period of   2015  . These   increase  s in cash used in investing activities were primarily due to proceeds from the sale of D H South in the third quarter of 2015, partially offset by lower additions to properties during the   third quarter   and   first nine months   of   2016  .  
    
  Financing Activities 
    
  Cash used in financing activities was $  304 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  , an   increase   of $  229 million   from $  75 million   in the same period of   2015  . For the   first nine months   of   2016  , cash used in financing activities was $  1,035 million  , an   increase   of $  319 million   from $  716 million   in the same period of   2015  . These   increase  s in cash used in financing activities were primarily due to issuance of long term debt in 2015. This increase is partially offset by net issuance of commercial paper during the third quarter and   first nine months   of 2016 versus net repayment of commercial paper in the same periods of   2015  , and lower purchases of CP Common Shares.  
    
  Interest Coverage Ratio 
    
  For the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company s interest coverage ratio was   5.4  , compared with   7.2   for the twelve months ended   September 30, 2015  . This decrease was primarily due to an increase in Net interest expense of   $132 million   based on the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period of   2015  , partially offset by year over year increase in Earnings before interest and taxes ("EBIT").  
    
  Excluding significant items from EBIT, Adjusted interest coverage ratio was   5.3   for the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   7.7   for the twelve months ended   September 30, 2015  . This decrease was primarily due to an increase in Net interest expense, as well as a year over year decrease in Adjusted EBIT. Interest coverage ratio, Adjusted interest coverage ratio, EBIT, Adjusted EBIT, and significant items are defined and reconciled in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
    
  Credit Measures 
    
  Credit ratings provide information relating to the Company s financing costs, liquidity and operations, which impacts the Company s ability to obtain short-term and long-term financing and/or the cost of such financing. 

49 

A mid-investment grade credit rating is an important measure in assessing the Company s ability to maintain access to public financing and to minimize the cost of capital. It also affects the ability of the Company to engage in certain collateralized business activities on a cost-effective basis. 
    
  Credit ratings and outlooks are based on the rating agencies  methodologies and can change from time to time to reflect their views of CP. Their views are affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, the Company s financial position and liquidity along with external factors beyond the Company s control. 
    
  As at September 30, 2016, the Company's credit rating from Standard   Poor's Rating Services ("Standard   Poor's"), and Moody's Investor Service ("Moody's") have remained unchanged from December 31, 2015. During the second quarter of 2016, Moody's changed the outlook on CP's Senior unsecured debt to negative from stable, and Dominion Bond Rating Service Limited ("DBRS") 
  changed the outlook on CP's Unsecured debentures and Medium-term notes to negative from stable. On August 2, 2016, DBRS  downgraded the Company's credit rating from BBB (high) to BBB for unsecured debentures and medium-term notes and from R-2 (high) to R-2 (middle) for the $1 billion Commercial paper program. Standard   Poor's affirmed a stable rating on CP's Long-term corporate credit, Senior secured debt and Senior unsecured debt.

            (1)   Credit ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold or sell securities and do not address the market price or suitability of a specific security for a particular investor. Credit ratings are based on the rating agencies' methodologies and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies. 

The Company s goal is to maintain a degree of continuity and predictability for investors by meeting a minimum threshold. The Adjusted net debt to Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) ratio for the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   was   3.0   and   2.7  , respectively. This increase was primarily due to additional debt issued during the 2015 fiscal year and commercial paper issued during the 2016 fiscal year, as well as a decrease in Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  . Adjusted net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio is defined and reconciled in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
    
  Free Cash 
    
  CP generated positive Free cash of   $240 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  , a decrease of   $254 million   from positive Free cash of   $494 million   in the same period of   2015  . For the   first nine months   of   2016  , CP generated positive Free cash of   $306 million  , a decrease of   $673 million   from positive Free cash of   $979 million   in the same period of   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from sale of D H South in the third quarter of 2015. Free cash is defined and reconciled in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
    
  Free cash is affected by seasonal fluctuations and by other factors including the size of the Company's additions to properties. Capital additions were   $294 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  ,   $155 million   lower than in the same period of   2015  . In the   first nine months   of   2016  , capital additions were   $902 million  ,   $165 million   lower than in the same period of   2015  .  

50 

Share Capital 
    
  At   October 17, 2016  , the latest practicable date, there were 146,262,114 Common Shares and no preferred shares issued and outstanding, which consists of 15,042 holders of record of the Company's Common Shares. In addition, CP has a Management Stock Option Incentive Plan ( MSOIP ), under which key officers and employees are granted options to purchase CP shares. Each option granted can be exercised for one Common Share. At   October 17, 2016  , 2.5 million options were outstanding under the Company s MSOIP and stand-alone option agreements entered into with Mr. E. Hunter Harrison and Mr. Keith E. Creel. There are 1.5 million options available to be issued by the Company s MSOIP in the future.  
    
  CP has a Director's Stock Option Plan ( DSOP ), under which directors are granted options to purchase CP shares. There are no outstanding options under the DSOP, which has 0.3 million options available to be issued in the future. 
    
  An aggregate of 178,618 Common Shares of the Company beneficially owned or controlled by Mr. E. Hunter Harrison have been pledged as security for his personal line of credit. 153,100 of those Common Shares were pledged on December 30, 2014 and 25,518 of those Common Shares were pledged on June 3, 2016. Effective July 18, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an anti-pledging policy, which prohibits transactions after the effective date of policy that result in the holding of Common Shares or securities exercisable or convertible into Common Shares, in a margin account, or otherwise pledging such securities as collateral for a loan, subject only to Board approved exceptions where the person wishing to pledge indicates his or her financial capacity to repay the loan without resort to the pledged securities. 

Non-GAAP Measures 
    
  The Company presents non-GAAP measures and cash flow information to provide a basis for evaluating underlying earnings and liquidity trends in the Company s business that can be compared with the results of operations in prior periods. In addition, these non-GAAP measures facilitate a multi-period assessment of long-term profitability allowing management and other external users of the Company s consolidated financial information to compare profitability on a long-term basis, including assessing future profitability, with that of the Company s peers.  
    
  These non-GAAP measures have no standardized meaning and are not defined by GAAP and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The presentation of these non-GAAP measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP.  
    
  Adjusted Performance Measures 
    
  The Company uses Adjusted operating income, Adjusted income, Adjusted diluted earnings per share and Adjusted operating ratio  to evaluate the Company s operating performance and for planning and forecasting future business operations and future profitability. These non-GAAP measures are presented in Financial Highlights and discussed further in other sections of this Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. These non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating results because they exclude certain significant items that are not considered indicative of future financial trends either by nature or amount. As a result, these items are excluded for management assessment of operational performance, allocation of resources and preparation of annual budgets. These significant items may include, but are not limited to, restructuring and asset impairment charges, individually significant gains and losses from sales of assets and certain items outside the control of management. These items may not be non-recurring. However, excluding these significant items from GAAP results allows for a consistent understanding of the Company's consolidated financial performance when performing a multi-period assessment including assessing the likelihood of future results. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures may provide insight to investors and other external users of the Company's consolidated financial information. 
    
  In   2016  , there were two significant items included in Net income: 
             
    in the third quarter, a $25 million expense ($18 million after current tax) related to   a legal settlement  ; and 
                
    during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , a net non-cash gain of   $153 million ($132 million after deferred tax)   due to FX translation of the Company s U.S. dollar-denominated debt as follows: 
                
    in the third quarter, a $46 million loss ($40 million after deferred tax);    
                
    in the second quarter, an $18 million gain ($16 million after deferred tax); and 

51 

In   2015  , there were four significant items included in Net income: 
             
    in the third quarter, a $68 million gain ($42 million after current tax) related to the sale of D H South; 
                
    in the third quarter, a $47 million charge ($35 million after deferred tax) related to the early redemption premium on notes; 
                
    in the second quarter, a deferred income tax expense of $23 million as a result of the change in the Alberta provincial corporate income tax rate; and 
                
    during the course of the year, a net non-cash loss of $297 million ($257 million after deferred tax) due to FX translation of the Company s U.S. dollar-denominated debt as follows: 
                  
    in the second quarter, a $10 million gain ($9 million after deferred tax); and 
                
    in the first quarter, a $64 million loss ($55 million after deferred tax).  
       
  In   2014  , there was one significant item included in Net income: 
             
    in the fourth quarter, a $12 million net non-cash loss ($9 million after deferred tax) due to FX translation on the Company s U.S. dollar-denominated debt. 
       
  Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures to GAAP Measures 
    
  The following tables reconcile non-GAAP measures presented in Financial Highlights, and discussed further in other sections of this Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, to the most directly comparable measures presented in accordance with GAAP for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 
    
  Adjusted operating income is calculated as Operating income reported on a GAAP basis less significant items. 

Adjusted income is calculated as Net income reported on a GAAP basis less significant items. 

(1)   
    Tax effect of adjustments was calculated as the pretax effect of the adjustments multiplied by the effective tax rate for each of the above items for the periods presented.    
       
  Adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated using Adjusted income, as defined above, divided by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding during the period as determined in accordance with GAAP.   
  
   52 

(1)   
    Tax effect of adjustments was calculated as the pretax effect of the adjustments multiplied by the effective tax rate for each of the above items for the periods presented.    
       
  Adjusted operating ratio is calculated as Adjusted operating income divided by revenues. 

ROIC and Adjusted ROIC 
    
  ROIC is calculated as Operating income less Other income and charges, tax affected at the Company's annualized effective tax rate, on a rolling twelve-month basis, divided by the sum of Total shareholders' equity, Long-term debt, Long-term debt maturing within one year and Short-term borrowing, as presented in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, averaged between the beginning and ending balance over a rolling twelve-month period. Adjusted ROIC excludes significant items reported in Operating income and Other income and charges in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, as these significant items are not considered indicative of future financial trends either by nature or amount. ROIC and Adjusted ROIC are all-encompassing performance measures that measure how productively the Company uses its long-term capital investments, representing critical indicators of good operating and investment decisions made by management and are important performance criteria in determining certain elements of the Company's long-term incentive plan. ROIC and Adjusted ROIC are presented in Financial Highlights and discussed further in Results of Operations of this Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
    
  Calculation of ROIC and Adjusted ROIC 

53 

Free Cash 
    
  Free cash is calculated as Cash provided by operating activities, less Cash used in investing activities and Dividends paid, adjusted for changes in cash and cash equivalents balances resulting from FX fluctuations. Free cash is a measure that management considers to be an indicator of liquidity. Free cash is useful to investors and other external users of the consolidated financial statements as it assists with the evaluation of the Company's ability to generate cash from its operations without incurring additional external financing. Positive Free cash indicates the amount of cash available for reinvestment in the business, or cash that can be returned to investors through increased dividends, stock repurchase programs, debt retirements or a combination of these. Conversely, negative Free cash indicates the amount of cash that must be raised from investors through new debt or equity issues, reduction in available cash balances or a combination of these. Free cash should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, Cash provided by operating activities. Free cash is presented in Financial Highlights and discussed further in Liquidity and Capital Resources of this Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
    
  Reconciliation of Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash 

FX Adjusted Variance 
    
  Financial result variances at constant currency are obtained by translating the comparable period of the prior year results denominated in U.S. dollars at the foreign exchange rates of the current period. FX adjusted variance ("FX adj. variance") allows certain financial result variances to be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons in the analysis of trends in business performance. FX adj. variances are presented in Operating Revenues and Operating Expenses of this Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
  
   54 

Interest Coverage Ratio 
    
  Interest coverage ratio is measured, on a rolling twelve-month basis, as EBIT divided by Net interest expense. This ratio provides investors, analysts, and lenders with useful information on how the Company's debt servicing capabilities have changed, period over period and in comparison to the Company s peers. Interest coverage ratio is discussed further in Liquidity and Capital Resources of this Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
    
  Adjusted interest coverage ratio is calculated as Adjusted EBIT divided by Net interest expense. By excluding significant items which affect EBIT, Adjusted interest coverage ratio assists management in comparing the Company's performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis. Adjusted interest coverage ratio is discussed further in Liquidity and Capital Resources of this Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

55 

Calculation of Interest Coverage Ratio and Adjusted Interest Coverage Ratio 

Reconciliation of Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization and Earnings before interest and tax 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as Adjusted EBIT plus Depreciation and amortization, adjusted for net periodic pension and other benefit cost and operating lease expense. EBIT is calculated as Operating income, less Other income and charges. Adjusted EBIT excludes significant items reported in Operating income and Other income and charges.  

Adjusted Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio 
    
  Adjusted net debt is defined as Long-term debt, Long-term debt maturing within one year and Short-term borrowing as reported on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets adjusted for pension plans deficit, the net present value of operating leases, which is discounted by the Company s effective interest rate for each of the periods presented, and Cash and cash equivalents. Adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is calculated as Adjusted net debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA. 
    
  The Adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is one of the key metrics used by credit rating agencies in assessing the Company's financial capacities and constraints and determining the credit rating of the Company. By excluding the impact of certain items that are not considered by management in developing a minimum threshold, Adjusted net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio provides a metric that management uses to evaluate the Company's financial discipline with respect to capital markets credit sensitivities from management's perspective and communicates it publicly with investors, analysts and credit rating agencies. Adjusted net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio is discussed further in Liquidity and Capital Resources of this Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  Guarantees 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had residual value guarantees on operating lease commitments of $19 million, compared to $28 million at   December 31, 2015  . The maximum amount that could be payable under these and all of the Company s other guarantees cannot be reasonably estimated due to the nature of certain guarantees. All or a portion of amounts paid under certain guarantees could be recoverable from other parties or through insurance. As at   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of these guarantees recognized as a liability was $6 million, compared to $4 million at   December 31, 2015  . 

Contractual Commitments 
    
  The accompanying table indicates the Company s obligations and commitments to make future payments for contracts, such as debt, capital lease and commercial arrangements. 
    
  Contractual Commitments  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  : 

(1)      Residual value guarantees on certain leased equipment with a maximum exposure of $19 m  illion are not included in the minimum payments shown above, as management believes that CP will not be required to make payments under these residual value guarantees. 
   (2)    Includes expected cash payments for restructuring, environmental remediation, asset retirement obligations, post-retirement benefits, workers  compensation benefits, long-term disability benefits, pension benefit payments for the Company s non-registered supplemental pension plan and certain other long-term liabilities. Projected payments for post-retirement benefits, workers  compensation benefits and long-term disability benefits include the anticipated payments for years 2016 to 2025. Pension contributions for the Company s registered pension plans are not included due to the volatility in calculating them. Pension payments are discussed further in Critical Accounting Estimates of this Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  

57 

Certain Other Financial Commitments 
    
  In addition to the financial commitments mentioned previously in Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Commitments of this Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the Company is party to certain other financial commitments set forth in the table and discussed below. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  :  

Letters of Credit 
    
  Letters of credit are obtained mainly to provide security to third parties under the terms of various agreements, including workers  compensation and supplemental pension plan. CP is liable for these contractual amounts in the case of non-performance under these agreements. Letters of credit are accommodated through a revolving credit facility and the Company s bilateral letters of credit facility. 
    
  Capital Commitments 
    
  The Company remains committed to maintaining the current high level of plant quality and renewing the franchise. As part of this commitment, CP has entered into contracts with suppliers to make various capital purchases related to track programs. Payments for these commitments are due in 2016 through 2032. These expenditures are expected to be financed by cash generated from operations or by issuing new debt. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
    
  To prepare consolidated financial statements that conform with GAAP, the Company is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. Using the most current information available, the Company reviews estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to environmental liabilities, pensions and other benefits, property, plant and equipment, deferred income taxes, legal and personal injury liabilities and goodwill. 
    
  The development, selection and disclosure of these estimates, and this MD A, have been reviewed by the Board of Directors  Audit Committee, which is composed entirely of independent directors. 
    
  Pensions and Other Benefits 
    
  Pension Liabilities and Pension Assets 
    
  The Company included pension benefit liabilities of $282 million in Pension and other benefit liabilities and $10 million in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the Company s Interim Consolidated Balance Sheets at   September 30, 2016  . The Company also included post-retirement benefits accruals of $388 million in Pension and other benefit liabilities and $21 million in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the Company s Interim Consolidated Balance Sheets at   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  The Company included pension benefit assets of $1,638 million in Pension assets on the Company s Interim Consolidated Balance Sheets at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Pension Plan Contributions 
    
  The Company made contributions of $4 million to the defined benefit pension plans in the   third quarter   of   2016  , compared with $20 million in the same period of   2015  . In the   first nine months   of   2016  , the Company made contributions of $38 million to the defined benefit pension plans, compared with $61 million in the same period of   2015  . The Company s main Canadian defined benefit pension plan accounts for 95% of CP s pension obligation and can produce significant volatility in pension funding requirements, given the pension fund s size, the many factors that drive the pension plan s funded status, and Canadian statutory pension funding requirements. The Company made voluntary prepayments of $600 million in 2011, $650 million in 2010 and $500 million in 2009 to the Company s main Canadian defined benefit pension plan. CP has applied $1,276 million of these voluntary prepayments to reduce its pension funding requirements in 2012 2015, leaving $474 million of the voluntary prepayments still available at December 31, 2015 to reduce CP s pension funding requirements in 2016 and future years. CP continues to have significant flexibility with respect to the rate at which the remaining voluntary prepayments are applied to reduce future years  pension contribution  
  
   58 

requirements, which allows CP to manage the volatility of future pension funding requirements. At this time, CP intends to apply   $5 million of the remaining voluntary prepayments against its   2016   pension funding requirements. 
    
  CP estimates its aggregate pension contributions, including its defined benefit and defined contribution plans, to be in the range of $50 million to $60 million in   2016  , and in the range of $50 million to $100 million per year from 2017 to 2019. These estimates reflect the Company s current intentions with respect to the rate at which CP will apply the remaining voluntary prepayments against contribution requirements in the next few years. 
    
  Future pension contributions will be highly dependent on the Company s actual experience with such variables as investment returns, interest rate fluctuations and demographic changes, on the rate at which previous years  voluntary prepayments are applied against pension contribution requirements, and on any changes in the regulatory environment. CP will continue to make contributions to the pension plans that, at a minimum, meet pension legislative requirements. 
    
  Deferred Income Taxes 
    
  A deferred income tax expense of $50 million was included in Income tax expense for the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to $nil for the same period of   2015  . For the   first nine months   of   2016  , deferred income tax expense of $233 million was included in Income tax expense compared to $106 million the same period of   2015  .  
    
  The increase in deferred income tax expense in the   third quarter   of   2016   was primarily due to the effect of 2015 discrete items, which includes the reclassification of deferred tax expense to current tax expense related to the sale of D H South and the deferred tax recovery related to unrealized FX translation losses on U.S. dollar-denominated debt, partially offset by lower pretax earnings compared to the same period of 2015. The increase in deferred income tax expense for the   first nine months   of 2016 was attributable to the increase in the   third quarter  , as well as unrealized FX translation gains on U.S. dollar-denominated debt, which does not give rise to current tax expense.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , deferred income tax liabilities of $3,591 million were recorded as a long-term liability and are composed largely of temporary differences related to accounting for properties.  
    
  Legal and Personal Injury Liabilities 
    
  Provisions for incidents, claims and litigation charged to income, of which $14 million were included in Purchase services and other expense and $25 million in Other charges, totaling $39 million in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared with $6 million for the same period of   2015  . For the   first nine months   of   2016  , these provisions amounted to $72 million compared with $60 million for the same period of   2015  . 

Forward-Looking Information 
    
  This MD A and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other relevant securities legislation. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, our updated expectations for 2016 which includes: operating ratio below 59%, mid-single-digit EPS growth from full-year 2015 adjusted EPS of $10.10, and capital expenditures of approximately $1.2 billion, statements concerning the Company s operations, anticipated financial performance, business prospects and strategies, including statements concerning the anticipation that cash flow from operations and various sources of financing will be sufficient to meet debt repayments and obligations in the foreseeable future and concerning anticipated capital programs, statements regarding future payments including income taxes and pension contributions, and capital expenditures. Forward-looking information typically contains statements with words such as  financial expectations ,  key assumptions ,  anticipate ,  believe ,  expect ,  plan ,  will ,  outlook ,  should  or similar words suggesting future outcomes. 
    
  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking information because it is possible that CP will not achieve predictions, forecasts, projections and other forms of forward-looking information. Current economic conditions render assumptions, although reasonable when made, subject to greater uncertainty. In addition, except as required by law, CP undertakes no obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
    
  By its nature, forward-looking information involves numerous assumptions, inherent risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the following factors: changes in business strategies; general North American and global economic, credit and business conditions; risks in agricultural production such as weather conditions and insect populations; the availability and price of energy commodities; the effects of competition and pricing pressures; industry capacity; shifts in market demand; inflation; changes in laws and regulations, including regulation of rates; changes in taxes and tax rates; potential increases in maintenance and operating costs; uncertainties of investigations, proceedings or other types of claims and litigation; labour disputes; risks and liabilities arising from derailments; transportation of dangerous goods; timing of completion of capital and maintenance projects; currency and interest rate fluctuations; effects of changes in market conditions on the financial position of pension plans and investments; and various events that could disrupt operations, including severe weather, droughts, floods, avalanches and earthquakes as well as security threats and the governmental response to them, and technological changes. 
  
   59 

There are more specific factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements contained in this MD A. These more specific factors are identified and discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of CP's   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other risks are detailed from time to time in reports filed by CP with securities regulators in Canada and the United States. 
  
   60 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  There have been no material changes to market risk during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from the information provided in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk of CP's   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K other than foreign exchange risk and share price impact on stock-based compensation discussed below: 
    
  Foreign Exchange Risk 
    
  Although CP conducts business primarily in Canada, a significant portion of its revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities including debt are denominated in U.S. dollars. The value of the Canadian dollar is affected by a number of domestic and international factors, including, without limitation, economic performance, and Canadian, U.S. and international monetary policies. Consequently, the Company s results are affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between these currencies. On an annualized basis, a $0.01 weakening (or strengthening) of the Canadian dollar positively (or negatively) impacts Total revenues by approximately $25 million and negatively (or positively) impacts Operating expenses by approximately $13 million. To manage this exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates between Canadian and U.S. dollars, CP may sell or purchase U.S. dollar forwards at fixed rates in future periods. In addition, changes in the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and other currencies (including the U.S. dollar) make the goods transported by the Company more or less competitive in the world marketplace and may in turn positively or negatively affect revenues.  
    
  FX translation on the Company s U.S. dollar-denominated long-term debt is also impacted by this risk. A weakening (or strengthening) of the Canadian dollar negatively (or positively) impacts Other income and charges in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. For further information, please refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 20 Financial Instruments, in CP's   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
    
  Share Price Impact on Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  For every $1.00 change in share price, stock-based compensation expense has a corresponding change of approximately $0.5 million to $0.7 million based on information available at   September 30, 2016  . This excludes the impact of changes in share price relative to the S P/TSX 60 index and relative to Class I railways, which may trigger different performance share unit payouts. 

61 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , an evaluation was carried out under the supervision of and with the participation of CP's management, including its CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  , to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
    
  During the   third quarter   of   2016  , the Company has not identified any changes in internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
