NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

Note
1 - Organization and Nature of Operations   

Nephros,
Inc. (collectively with subsidiary,  Nephros  or the  Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the
State of Delaware on April 3, 1997. Nephros was founded by health professionals, scientists and engineers affiliated with Columbia
University to develop advanced End Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) therapy technology and products. The Company has two
products in the hemodiafiltration ( HDF ) modality to deliver therapy for ESRD patients. These are the OLp r
mid-dilution HDF filter or  dialyzer,  designed expressly for HDF therapy, and the OLp r H2H HDF module, an add-on
module designed to allow the most common types of hemodialysis machines to be used for HDF therapy. In 2009, the Company introduced
its Dual Stage Ultrafilter ( DSU ) water filter, which represented a new and complementary product line to the Company s
ESRD therapy business. The DSU incorporates the Company s unique and proprietary dual stage filter architecture.  

On
June 4, 2003, Nephros International Limited was incorporated under the laws of Ireland as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nephros,
Inc. In August 2003, the Company established a European Customer Service and financial operations center in Dublin, Ireland.  

The
U.S. facilities, located at 41 Grand Avenue, River Edge, New Jersey, 07661, are used to house the Company s corporate headquarters
and research facilities.  

Note
2 - Basis of Presentation and Going Concern   

Interim
Financial Information   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Nephros, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Nephros
International Limited should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included
in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC )
on March 30, 2016. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and in accordance with
the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, since they are interim statements,
the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include all of the information and notes required
by GAAP for a complete financial statement presentation. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was
derived from the Company s audited consolidated financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP.
In the opinion of management, the condensed consolidated interim financial statements reflect all adjustments consisting of normal,
recurring adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows
for the condensed consolidated interim periods presented. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full
year. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially
from those estimates. Included in these estimates are assumptions about the valuation of the warrant liability, the collection
of accounts receivable, the value of inventories, the useful lives of property and equipment and intangible assets, the valuation
allowance of deferred taxes and the assumptions used in determining stock compensation such as expected volatility and risk-free
interest rate and the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.  

NEPHROS,
INC.   

NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

Note
2 - Basis of Presentation and Going Concern (continued)   

Going
Concern   

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.
The Company s recurring losses and difficulty in generating sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations and sustain its
operations raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

The
Company has incurred significant losses in operations in each quarter and has not generated positive cash flow from operations
since inception. To become profitable, the Company must increase revenue substantially and achieve and maintain income from operations.
If the Company is not able to increase revenue and generate income from operations sufficiently to achieve profitability, its
results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.  

Based
on the Company s current projections, the Company expects that its existing cash balances and projected increase in product
sales from the launch of new products, will allow the Company to fund its operations at least into the first quarter of 2017,
if not longer, depending on the timing and market acceptance of our new products. This assumption excludes the impact of future
cash receipts from recurring operations. There can be no assurance that the Company s future cash flow will be sufficient
to meet its obligations and commitments. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future
to meet its operating requirements and other commitments, the Company will be required to adopt alternatives, such as seeking
to raise debt or equity capital, curtailing its planned activities or ceasing its operations. There can be no assurance that any
such actions could be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms or at all, or that these actions would enable the Company
to continue to satisfy its capital requirements.  

Recently
Adopted Accounting Pronouncement   

In
April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
2015-03,  Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 2015-03): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs 
related to the presentation requirements for debt issuance costs and debt discount and premium. ASU 2015-03 requires that debt
issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying
amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs
are not affected by ASU 2015-03. ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The
Company adopted ASU 2015-03 upon entering into the Note and Warrant Agreement as discussed in Note 11.

3 - Major Customers and Concentration of Credit Risk (continued)   

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the following customers accounted for the following percentages of the Company s
accounts receivable, respectively.  

The
Company provides credit terms to customers in connection with purchases of the Company s products. Management periodically
reviews customer account activity in order to assess the adequacy of the allowances provided for potential collection issues and
returns. Adjustments, if any, are made to reserve balances following the completion of these reviews to reflect management s
best estimate of potential losses. The allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $48,000 and $15,000 as of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

Note
4 - Revenue Recognition   

Revenue
is recognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 605. Four basic criteria must be
met before revenue can be recognized: (i) persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred or services
have been rendered; (iii) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.  

The
Company recognizes revenue related to product sales when delivery is confirmed by its external logistics provider and the other
criteria of ASC Topic 605 are met. Product revenue is recorded net of returns and allowances. All costs and duties relating to
delivery are absorbed by the Company. Shipments for all products are currently received directly by the Company s customers.  

Deferred
revenue on the accompanying September 30, 2016 condensed consolidated balance sheet is approximately $365,000 and is related to
the Company s License Agreement with Bellco (see Note 12), which is being deferred over the remainder of the expected obligation
period. The Company has recognized approximately $2,711,000 of revenue related to the Bellco License Agreement to date and approximately
$17,000 and $52,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company recognized approximately
$17,000 and $52,000, respectively, of revenue related to this License Agreement for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015. Revenue recognized in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 relates to the upfront payment received
in February 2014. Approximately $17,000 of revenue will be recognized in the remaining three months of fiscal year 2016 and approximately
$69,000 of revenue will be recognized in each of the years ended December 31, 2017 through 2021. In addition, beginning on January
1, 2015, Bellco pays the Company a royalty based on the number of units of certain products sold per year due one fiscal quarter
in arrears. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized royalty revenue of approximately $27,000
and $84,000, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized royalty revenue of approximately
$29,000 and $58,000, respectively. See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, for further discussion of the Bellco License Agreement.  

The
Company also invoiced Biocon 1, LLC approximately $13,000 and $24,000 related to consulting services provided during the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, which is included in license, royalty and other revenue on the condensed
consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Approximately $24,000 is also included in accounts receivable as
of September 30, 2016.  

On
May 6, 2015, the Company entered into a Sublicense Agreement with CamelBak Products, LLC ( CamelBak ). The Company
granted CamelBak an exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide (with the exception of Italy) sublicense and license, in each case
solely to market, sell, distribute, import and export the HydraGuard individual water treatment devices. In exchange for the rights
granted to CamelBak, CamelBak agreed, through December 31, 2022, to pay the Company a percentage of the gross profit on any sales
made to a branch of the U.S. military, subject to certain exceptions, and to pay the Company a fixed per-unit fee for any other
sales made. The Company recognized royalty revenue of $10,000 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Note
5 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

The
carrying amounts of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the short-term
maturity of these instruments.  

The
fair value guidance requires fair value measurements be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:  

Level
    1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets
    or liabilities;   

Level
    2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially
    the full term of the asset or liability;   

Level
    3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable
    (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).   

Fair
Value of Investment in Lease, net, and Unsecured Long-Term Note Payable   

The
carrying amounts of the investment in lease, net, and the unsecured long-term note payable approximate fair value as of September
30, 2016 because those financial instruments bear interest at rates that approximate current market rates for similar agreements
with similar maturities and credit quality.  

Warrant
Liability   

The
Company had outstanding warrants originally issued in 2007 (the  2007 Warrants ) that were accounted for as a derivative
liability until they were fully exercised on September 29, 2015. The 2007 Warrants were classified as a liability because the
transactions that would trigger the anti-dilution adjustment provision in the 2007 Warrants were not inputs to the fair value
of the 2007 Warrants. The 2007 Warrants were recorded as liabilities at their estimated fair value at the date of issuance, with
the subsequent changes in estimated fair value recorded in changes in fair value of warrant liability in the Company s consolidated
statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) in each subsequent period. The Company utilized a binomial options pricing
model to value the 2007 Warrants at each reporting period.  

The
estimated fair value of the 2007 Warrants as of June 30, 2015 was determined using Level 3 inputs. Inherent in a binomial options
pricing model are assumptions related to expected stock-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend
yield. The Company estimated the volatility of its common stock based on historical volatility that matched the expected remaining
life of the 2007 Warrants. The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date
for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the 2007 Warrants. The expected life of the 2007 Warrants was assumed
to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The dividend rate was based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipated
to remain at zero.  

On
the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the three month period ended September 30, 2015,
the Company recorded income of $2,287,000 as a result of the change in fair value of the warrant liability. On the condensed consolidated
statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded income
of $2,099,000 as a result of the change in fair value of the warrant liability. A reconciliation of the warrant liability for
the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015 is as follows:

5 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments (continued)   

The
following table summarizes the calculated aggregate fair value of the 2007 Warrants, along with the assumptions utilized in each
calculation:  

On
September 29, 2015, the Company entered into a Warrant Amendment and Exercise Agreement (the  Amendment ) with Lambda
Investors, LLC ( Lambda ), the Company s largest stockholder who owns approximately 62% of the Company s
outstanding common stock. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Company agreed to reduce the current exercise price of the 2007 Warrants
by 50%, to $0.15 per share, in exchange for Lambda s agreement to exercise the 2007 Warrants in their entirety immediately
following the modification. Upon exercise of the 2007 Warrants, the Company issued 11,742,100 shares of common stock to Lambda
and received approximately $1.76 million in cash proceeds from Lambda. Following such exercise, no 2007 Warrants remain outstanding.
The value of the 2007 Warrants as of September 29, 2015, after the modification, was approximately $7,048,000, calculated as intrinsic
value with an expected term of zero. As a result, approximately $1,761,000 was recorded as warrant modification expense for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Note
6 - Stock Plans and Share-Based Payments   

Stock
Options   

The
Company accounts for stock option grants to employees and non-employee directors under the provisions of ASC 718, Stock Compensation.
ASC 718 requires the recognition of the fair value of stock-based compensation in the statement of operations. In addition, the
Company accounts for stock option grants to consultants under the provisions of ASC 505-50, and as such, these stock options are
revalued at each reporting period through the vesting period.  

The
fair value of stock option awards is estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of stock-based awards
that vest upon service conditions is amortized over the vesting period of the award using the straight-line method.  

The
Company granted 195,520 stock options to employees and non-employee directors during the three months ended September 30, 2016.
The fair value of the stock options will be expensed over the vesting period. The grant date fair value of the stock options was
approximately $62,000.  

The
Company granted 30,000 stock options to a consultant during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The fair value of the stock
options will be expensed over the one-year vesting period. The fair value of the stock options as of September 30, 2016 was approximately
$9,000. In accordance with ASC 505-50, the stock options granted to the consultant are remeasured at each reporting period until
vested.  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, previously issued stock options were modified for a non-employee director who is no
longer serving as a director for the Company. As a result of modification, approximately $5,000 was recognized as stock option
modification expense and included in stock-based compensation expense on the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of
operations and comprehensive loss.  

The
Company calculates expected volatility for a stock-based grant based on historic monthly common stock price observations during
the period immediately preceding the grant that is equal in length to the expected term of the grant. The Company also estimates
future forfeitures, using historical employee behaviors related to forfeitures, as a part of the estimate of expense as of the
grant date. With respect to grants of options, the risk free rate of interest is based on the U.S. Treasury rates appropriate
for the expected term of the grant.

8 - Net Income (Loss) per Common Share   

Basic
income (loss) per common share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the number of weighted
average common shares issued and outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share is calculated by dividing net income (loss)
available to common shareholders, adjusted for amounts representing the potential dilutive effect from the exercise of stock options
and warrants, of any outstanding shares of unvested restricted stock and of the conversion of convertible securities, as applicable.
If applicable for a given period, the Company calculates dilutive potential common shares using the treasury stock method, which
assumes the Company will use the proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants to repurchase shares of common stock
to hold in its treasury stock reserves.  

The
following potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the computations of diluted weighted-average shares outstanding
as they would be anti-dilutive:

9 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

In
May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers,  related to revenue recognition. The
underlying principle of the new standard is that a business or other organization will recognize revenue to depict the transfer
of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects to be entitled to in exchange for the goods
or services. The standard also requires more detailed disclosures and provides additional guidance for transactions that were
not addressed completely in prior accounting guidance. ASU 2014-09 provides alternative methods of initial adoption, and was to
be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption
was not permitted. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the
Effective Date.  The amendment in this ASU defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities for one year. Public
business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09
to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that fiscal year. Early adoption
is permitted only for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that fiscal year.
The Company is currently reviewing the revised guidance and assessing the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure
of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.  ASU 2014-15 provides guidance about management s
responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and
sets rules for how this information should be disclosed in the financial statements. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods
ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating
any impact the adoption of ASU 2014-15 might have on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,  that requires inventory be measured
at the lower of cost and net realizable value and options that currently exist for market value to be eliminated. The standard
defines net realizable value as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs
of completion, disposal, and transportation and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods
within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The guidance should be applied prospectively. The Company does not believe
that the adoption of ASU 2015-11 will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,  that requires that deferred
tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement
that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is
not affected by this amendment. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning
after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted and the standard may be applied either retrospectively or on a prospective
basis to all deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company does not believe that the adoption of ASU 2015-17 will have a significant
impact on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, 
that modifies certain aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The accounting
standard update is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, and
early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting guidance will have

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases,  that discusses how an entity should account for lease assets
and lease liabilities. The guidance specifies that an entity that is a lessee under lease agreements should recognize lease assets
and lease liabilities for those leases classified as operating leases under previous FASB guidance. Accounting for leases by lessors
is largely unchanged under the new guidance. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal
year 2019. Early adoption is permitted. In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the
beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting

11 - Unsecured Promissory Notes and Warrants   

On
June 7, 2016, the Company entered into a Note and Warrant Agreement (the  Agreement ) with new creditors as well as
existing shareholders under which the Company issued unsecured promissory notes ( Notes ) and warrants ( Warrants )
resulting in total gross proceeds to the Company during June 2016 of approximately $1,187,000. The outstanding principal under
the Notes accrues interest at a rate of 11% per annum. The Company is required to make interest only payments on a semi-annual
basis, and all outstanding principal under the Notes is repayable in cash on June 7, 2019, the third anniversary of the date of
issuance. In addition to the Notes, the Company issued Warrants to purchase approximately 2.4 million shares of the Company s
common stock to the investors in the Agreement. The warrants have an exercise price of $0.30 per share and are exercisable for
5 years from the issuance date. The Warrants issued under the Agreement are indexed to the Company s common stock, therefore,
the Company is accounting for the Warrants as a component of equity. In connection with the Agreement, the Company incurred approximately
$13,000 in legal fees.  

The
approximately $1,187,000 in gross proceeds from the Agreement, along with the legal fees of approximately $13,000, were allocated
between the Notes and Warrants based on their relative fair values. The portion of the proceeds, including fees, allocated to
the Warrants of approximately $393,000 was accounted for as additional paid-in capital. Approximately $4,000 of the legal fees
were allocated to the Warrants and recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital. The remainder of the proceeds of approximately
$794,000, including fees, was allocated to the Notes with the fair value of the Warrants resulting in a debt discount. The debt
discount is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method in accordance with ASC 835 over the term of
the Agreement. Approximately $23,000 and $29,000 was recognized as amortization of debt discount during the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and is included in interest expense on the condensed consolidated interim statement of
operations and comprehensive loss. As of September 30, 2016, approximately $43,000 of interest expense has been accrued. As of
September 30, 2016, the portion of the outstanding unsecured promissory notes due to entities controlled by a member of management
and to the majority shareholder amounted to $30,000 and $300,000, respectively. There were no unsecured long-term notes payable
outstanding as of December 31, 2015.

On
February 19, 2014, the Company entered into the First Amendment to License Agreement (the  First Amendment ), by and
between the Company and Bellco, which amends the License Agreement. Pursuant to the First Amendment, the Company and Bellco agreed
to extend the term of the License Agreement from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2021. The First Amendment also expands the
Territory covered by the License Agreement to include Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Korea, Mexico, Brazil, China and the Netherlands.
The First Amendment further provides new minimum sales targets which, if not satisfied, will, at the discretion of the Company,
result in conversion of the license to non-exclusive status. The Company has agreed to reduce the fixed royalty payment payable
to the Company for the period beginning on January 1, 2015 through and including December 31, 2021. Beginning on January 1, 2015
through and including December 31, 2021, Bellco will pay the Company a royalty based on the number of units of Products sold per
year in the Territory as follows: for the first 125,000 units sold in total,  1.75 (estimated at approximately $1.95 using
current exchange rates) per unit; thereafter,  1.25 (estimated at approximately $1.40 using current exchange rates) per unit.
In addition, the Company received a total of  450,000 (approximately $612,000) in upfront fees in connection with the First
Amendment, half of which was received on February 19, 2014 and the remaining half was received on April 4, 2014. In addition,
the First Amendment provides that, in the event that the Company pursues a transaction to sell, assign or transfer all right,
title and interest to the licensed patents to a third party, the Company will provide Bellco with written notice thereof and a
right of first offer with respect to the contemplated transaction for a period of thirty (30) days. See Note 4 for further discussion
of the licensing revenue recognized by the Company related to the upfront fees.  

In
addition to the licensing revenue, the Company recognized royalty revenue related to the First Amendment with Bellco. For the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized approximately $27,000 and $84,000, respectively. For the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized approximately $29,000 and $58,000, respectively.  

License
and Supply Agreement   

On
April 23, 2012, the Company entered into a License and Supply Agreement (the  License and Supply Agreement ) with
Medica S.p.A. ( Medica ), an Italy-based medical product manufacturing company, for the marketing and sale of certain
filtration products based upon Medica s proprietary Medisulfone ultrafiltration technology in conjunction with the Company s
filtration products (collectively, the  Filtration Products ), and to engage in an exclusive supply arrangement for
the Filtration Products. Under the License and Supply Agreement, Medica granted to the Company an exclusive license, with right
of sublicense, to market, promote, distribute, offer for sale and sell the Filtration Products worldwide, excluding Italy for
the first three years, during the term of the License and Supply Agreement. In addition, the Company granted to Medica an exclusive
license under the Company s intellectual property to make the Filtration Products during the term of the License and Supply
Agreement. In exchange for the rights granted, the Company agreed to make minimum annual aggregate purchases from Medica of  300,000
(approximately $400,000),  500,000 (approximately $700,000) and  750,000 (approximately $880,000) for the years 2012,
2013 and 2014, respectively. In the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company s aggregate purchase commitments totaled approximately
 999,000 (approximately $1,119,000). For calendar years 2016 through 2022, annual minimum amounts will be mutually agreed
upon between Medica and the Company. In December 2015, the Company and Medica formalized the agreed upon minimum purchase level
for calendar year 2016 of  1,200,000 (approximately $1,500,000). In exchange for the license, the Company paid Medica a total
of  1,500,000 (approximately $2,000,000) in three installments:  500,000 (approximately $700,000) on April 23, 2012,
 600,000 (approximately $800,000) on February 4, 2013, and  400,000 (approximately $500,000) on May 23, 2013.  

As
further consideration for the license and other rights granted to the Company, the Company granted Medica options to purchase
300,000 shares of the Company s common stock. The fair market value of these stock options was approximately $273,000 as
of April 23, 2012, calculated as described in Note 6 under Stock Options. Together with the total installment payments described
above, the fair market value of the options has been capitalized as a long-term intangible asset. The gross value of the intangible
asset capitalized was approximately $2,250,000. Included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheet is approximately
$1,315,000 and $1,473,000, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, related to the License and Supply Agreement.
Accumulated amortization is approximately $935,000 and $777,000 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

Investment
in Lease, net   

On
October 8, 2015, the Company entered into an equipment lease agreement with Biocon 1, LLC. The lease commenced on January 1, 2016
with a term of 60 months and monthly rental payments of approximately $1,800 will be paid to the Company. At the completion of
the lease term, Biocon 1, LLC will own the equipment provided under the agreement. An investment in lease was established for
the sales-type lease receivable at the present value of the future minimum lease payments. Interest income will be recognized
monthly over the lease term using the effective-interest method. Cash received will be applied against the direct financing lease
receivable and will be presented within changes in operating assets and liabilities in the operating section of the Company s
consolidated statement of cash flows. At lease inception, an investment in the lease of approximately $92,000 was recorded, net
of unearned interest of approximately $14,000. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, approximately $1,000
and $4,000, respectively, was recognized in interest income. As of September 30, 2016, investment in lease, current, is approximately
$22,000, net of unearned interest of $4,000. As of September 30, 2016, investment in lease, noncurrent, is approximately $65,000,

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

This
discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q and the notes thereto, as well as the other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the  Forward-Looking
Statements  section hereof, and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, including the  Risk
Factors  and  Business  sections thereof. This discussion contains a number of forward-looking statements, all
of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our actual results may differ materially.   

Financial
Operations Overview   

Revenue
Recognition:  Revenue is recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 605. Four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be
recognized: (i) persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (iii)
the fee is fixed and determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.  

Cost
of Goods Sold:  Cost of goods sold represents the acquisition cost for the products we purchase and sell from our third party
manufacturers as well as damaged and obsolete inventory written off.  

Research
and Development:  Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred in identifying, developing and testing product
candidates. These expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel, fees of our scientific and engineering
consultants and subcontractors and related costs, clinical studies, machine and product parts and software and product testing.
We expense research and development costs as incurred.  

Selling,
General and Administrative:  Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing expenses
as well as personnel and related costs for general corporate functions, including finance, accounting, legal, human resources,
facilities and information systems expense.  

Overview   

Nephros
is a commercial stage medical device and commercial products company that develops and sells high performance liquid purification
filters and hemodiafiltration ( HDF ) systems. Our filters, which are generally classified as ultrafilters, are primarily
used in dialysis centers for the removal of biological contaminants from water and bicarbonate concentrate, and used in hospitals
for the prevention of infection from water borne pathogens, such as legionella and pseudomonas. Because our ultrafilters capture
contaminants as small as 0.005 microns in size, they minimize exposure to a wide variety of bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites
and endotoxins.  

Our
OLp r H2H Hemodiafiltration System, used in conjunction with a standard hemodialysis machine, is the only FDA 510(k) cleared
medical device that enables nephrologists to provide hemodiafiltration treatment to patients with end stage renal disease ( ESRD ).
Additionally, we sell hemodiafilters, which serve the same purpose as dialyzers in an HD treatment, and other disposables used
in the hemodiafiltration treatment process.  

We
were founded in 1997 by healthcare professionals affiliated with Columbia University Medical Center/New York-Presbyterian Hospital
to develop and commercialize an alternative method to hemodialysis ( HD ). We have extended our filtration technologies
to meet the demand for liquid purification in other areas, in particular water purification.  

Going
Concern   

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. Our recurring
losses and difficulty in generating sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations and sustain our operations raise substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

We
have incurred significant losses in operations in each quarter and have not generated positive cash flow from operations since
inception. To become profitable, we must increase revenue substantially and achieve and maintain income from operations. If we
are not able to increase revenue and generate income from operations sufficiently to achieve profitability, our results of operations
and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.  

Based
on our current cash flow projections, we expect that our existing cash balances and our projected increases in product sales from
the launch of new products will allow us to fund our operations at least into the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, depending
on the timing and market up-take of our new products. This assumption excludes the impact of future cash receipts from recurring
operations. There can be no assurance that our future cash flow will be sufficient to meet our obligations and commitments. If
we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our commitments, we will be required to
adopt alternatives, such as seeking to raise debt or equity capital, curtailing our planned activities or ceasing our operations.
There can be no assurance that any such actions could be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms or at all, or that
these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements.  

Our
Products   

Presently,
we have two core product lines: HDF Systems and Ultrafiltration Products.  

HDF
Systems    

The
current standard of care in the U.S. for patients with chronic renal failure is HD, a process in which toxins are cleared via
diffusion. Patients typically receive HD treatment at least 3 times weekly for 3-4 hours per treatment. HD is most effective in
removing smaller, easily diffusible toxins. For patients with acute renal failure, the current standard of care in the U.S. is
hemofiltration ( HF ), a process where toxins are cleared via convection. HF offers a much better removal of larger
sized toxins when compared to HD. However, HF treatment is performed on a daily basis, and typically takes 12-24 hours.  

Hemodiafiltration
( HDF ) is an alternative dialysis modality that combines the benefits of HD and HF into a single therapy by clearing
toxins using both diffusion and convection. Though not widely used in the U.S., HDF is much more prevalent in Europe and is performed
in approximately 16% of patients. Clinical experience and literature show the following clinical and patient benefits of HDF:  

Enhanced
    clearance of middle and large molecular weight toxins   

Improved
    survival - up to a 35% reduction in mortality risk   

Reduction
    in the occurrence of dialysis-related amyloidosis   

Reduction
    in inflammation   

Reduction
    in medication such as EPO and phosphate binders   

Improved
    patient quality of life   

Reduction
    in number of hospitalizations and overall length of stay   

However,
like HF, HDF can be resource intensive and can require a significant amount of time to deliver one course of treatment.  

We
have developed a modified approach to HDF that we believe is more patient-friendly, less resource-intensive, and can be used in
conjunction with current HD machines. We refer to our approach as an online mid-dilution hemodiafiltration ( mid-dilution
HDF ) system and it consists of our OLp r H2H Hemodiafiltration Module ( H2H Module ), our OLp r MD
220 Hemodiafilter ( HDF Filter ) and our H2H Substitution Filter ( Dialysate Filter ).  

The
H2H Module utilizes a standard HD machine to perform on-line hemodiafiltration therapy. The HD machine controls and monitors the
basic treatment functions, as it would normally when providing HD therapy. The H2H Module is a free-standing, movable device that
is placed next to either side of an HD machine. The H2H Module is connected to the clinic s water supply, drain, and electricity.  

The
H2H Module utilizes the HDF Filter and is very similar to a typical hollow fiber dialyzer assembled with a single hollow fiber
bundle made with a high-flux (or high-permeability) membrane. The fiber bundle is separated into two discrete, but serially connected
blood paths. Dialysate flows in one direction that is counter-current to blood flow in Stage 1 and co-current to blood flow in
Stage 2.  

In
addition to the HDF Filter, the H2H Module also utilizes a Dialysate Filter during patient treatment. The Dialysate Filter is
a hollow fiber, ultrafilter device that consists of two sequential (redundant) ultrafiltration stages in a single housing. During
on-line HDF with the H2H Module, fresh dialysate is redirected by the H2H Module s hydraulic (substitution) pump and passed
through this dual-stage ultrafilter before being infused as substitution fluid into the extracorporeal circuit. Providing ultrapure
dialysate is crucial for the success of on-line HDF treatment.  

Our
HDF System is cleared by the FDA to market for use with an ultrafiltration controlled hemodialysis machine that provides ultrapure
dialysate in accordance with current ANSI/AAMI/ISO standards, for the treatment of patients with chronic renal failure in the
United States. Our on-line mid-dilution HDF system is the only on-line mid-dilution HDF system of its kind to be cleared by the
FDA to date.  

In
May 2014, DaVita Healthcare Partners initiated an evaluation of our HDF System to treat patients at DaVita s North Colorado
Springs Clinic. In February 2015, we announced that, in the course of the evaluation, DaVita informed Nephros that it would require
additional validation of the system. Nephros and DaVita agreed upon a protocol for the additional validation work which was completed
in March 2015. We do not believe that DaVita will restart the evaluation in the near term.  

In
March 2015, we announced that the Renal Research Institute ( RRI ), a research division of Fresenius Medical Care,
was conducting an ongoing evaluation of our HDF system in its clinic. As of June 2016, our HDF Systems had performed over 1,200
patient treatments. Over the last 18 months of commercial use, we have gathered direct feedback from users of our HDF System to
help improve our system and our training methodology. In January 2016, we updated our training procedures and rolled out a software
update, which was focused on improving the system s alignment with nurse work flow. In June 2016, after approximately 5
months of successfully completed patient treatments with the updated software, we concluded the evaluation project with RRI.  

We
expect that a dialysis clinic associated with Vanderbilt University will begin treating patients with our HDF Systems before the
end of 2016. Our goal over the next 12-18 months is to develop a better understanding of how our system best fits into the current
clinical and economic ESRD treatment paradigm with the ultimate goals of a) improving the quality of life for the patient, b)
reducing overall expenditure compared to other dialysis modalities, c) minimizing the impact on nurse work flow at the clinic,
and d) demonstrating the pharmacoeconomic benefit of the HDF technology to the U.S. healthcare system, as has been done in Europe
with other HDF systems. In addition, we are in the process of developing version 2.0 of our HDF System, which will enable us to
manufacture at scale, as well as potentially reduce the per treatment cost of performing HDF.  

Ultrafiltration
Products    

Our
ultrafiltration products target a number of markets.  

Hospitals
    and Other Healthcare Facilities : Filtration of water to be used for patient washing and drinking as an aid in infection
    control. The filters also produce water that is suitable for wound cleansing, cleaning of equipment used in medical procedures
    and washing of surgeons  hands.   

Dialysis
    Centers - Water/Bicarbonate : Filtration of water or bicarbonate concentrate used in HD devices.   

Military
    and Outdoor Recreation : Individual water purification devices used by soldiers and backpackers to produce drinking water
    in the field, as well as filters customized to remote water processing systems.   

Commercial
    Facilities : Filtration of water for washing and drinking, including use in ice machines and soda fountains.   

Our
Target Markets  

Hospitals
and Other Healthcare Facilities.  According to the American Hospital Association approximately 5,700 hospitals, with approximately
915,000 beds, treated over 35 million patients in the U.S. in 2013. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
estimates that healthcare associated infections( HAI ) occurred in approximately 1 out of every 25 hospital patients.
HAIs affect patients in a hospital or other healthcare facility, and are not present or incubating at the time of admission. They
also include infections acquired by patients in the hospital or facility but appearing after discharge, and occupational infections
among staff. Many HAIs are waterborne bacteria and viruses that can thrive in aging or complex plumbing systems often found in
healthcare facilities. The Affordable Care Act, which was passed in March 2010, puts in place comprehensive health insurance reforms
that aim to lower costs and enhance quality of care. With its implementation, healthcare providers have substantial incentives
to deliver better care or be forced to absorb the expenses associated with repeat medical procedures or complications like HAIs.
As a consequence, hospitals and other healthcare facilities are proactively implementing strategies to reduce the potential for
HAIs. Our ultrafilters are designed to aid in infection control in the hospital and healthcare setting by treating facility water
at the point of delivery, for example, from sinks and showers.  

On
June 30, 2014 we submitted to the FDA, for 510(k) clearance, the DSU-H and SSU-H Ultrafilters to filter EPA quality drinking water
to remove microbiological contaminants and waterborne pathogens. On October 28, 2014, we announced that we received 510(k) clearance
from the FDA to market our DSU-H and SSU-H Ultrafilters as medical devices for use in the hospital setting. The DSU-H and SSU-H
Ultrafilters are intended to be used to filter EPA quality drinking water. The filters retain bacteria, viruses and endotoxin.
By providing ultrapure water for patient washing and drinking, the filters aid in infection control. The filters also produce
water that is suitable for wound cleansing, cleaning of equipment used in medical procedures and washing of a surgeon s
hands. The filters are not intended to provide water that can be used as a substitute for United States Pharmacopeia ( USP )
sterile water.  

In
May 2015, we received a warning letter from the FDA resulting from an October 2014 inspection. In the letter, the FDA alleged
deficiencies relating to our compliance with the quality system regulation and the medical device reporting regulation. The warning
letter did not restrict our ability to manufacture, produce or ship any of our products, nor did it require the withdrawal of
any product from the marketplace. In August 2015, we received a subsequent letter from the FDA noting that it had received our
response correspondence detailing our completed corrective actions. The corrective actions included revisions to our standard
operating procedures relating to purchasing and supplier controls, adverse event reporting, and complaint handling and monitoring.
In February 2016, the FDA performed another on-site inspection. There were no observations, or 483 s, cited at the conclusion
of the inspection. In April 2016, we received a third letter from the FDA noting that the FDA had completed its evaluation of
our corrective actions and that, based on its evaluation, it appeared that we had addressed the deficiencies specified in the
May 2015 warning letter.  

In
June 2015, the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc. ( ASHRAE ) approved
Standard 188-2015,  Legionellosis: Risk Management for Building Water Systems . We believe the approval of ASHRAE
188-2015 ( S188 ) as a national standard will have a positive impact on point of delivery filtration market. The S188
applies to any human occupied building that is not a single family residence; requires the building to have a plan to control
for waterborne infection; requires heat, chemical or both cleaning in the event of a suspected or confirmed presence of legionella;
and recommends point-of-use filters in areas of high risk. We are enhancing our efforts to support our distributors by developing
and delivering focused sales training to their sales forces on the use of our filters to support an overall program of infection
risk prevention; and by, whenever possible, doing joint sales calls with our distributors on potential hospital customers to both
serve as a product expert and to field train their sales representatives.  

On
October 27, 2015, we announced that we had submitted the S100 Point of Use filter to the FDA for 510(k) clearance. In late December
2015, the FDA requested additional information. On April 14, 2016, we announced that we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA
to market our S100 Point of Use filter.  

On
May 27, 2016, we submitted the PathoGuard  10  cartridge filter to the FDA for 510(k) under the Special 510(k): Device
Modification process. Following our meeting with the FDA on August 15, 2016, and additional follow-up communications, we initiated
some additional biocompatibility studies and other related testing of our products. The testing was completed in early November
and we will submit the additional information for the HydraGuard  (change from PathoGuard ) Special 510(k) before
the end of November 2016.  

The
complete hospital infection control product line, including in-line and point of use filters, can be viewed on our website at
 http://www.nephros.com/infection-control/ . We are not including the information on our website as a part of, or incorporating
it by reference into, this report.  

Dialysis
Centers - Water/Bicarbonate . To perform hemodialysis, all dialysis clinics have dedicated water purification systems to produce
water and bicarbonate concentrate. Water and bicarbonate concentrate are essential ingredients for making dialysate, the liquid
that removes waste material from the blood. According to the American Journal of Kidney Diseases, there are approximately 6,300
dialysis clinics in the United States servicing approximately 430,000 patients annually. We estimate that there are over 100,000
hemodialysis machines in operation in the United States.  

Medicare
is the main payer for dialysis treatment in the U.S. To be eligible for Medicare reimbursement, dialysis centers must meet the
minimum standards for water and bicarbonate concentrate quality set by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation
( AAMI ), the American National Standards Institute ( ANSI ) and the International Standards Organization
( ISO ). We anticipate that the stricter standards approved by these organizations in 2009 will be adopted by Medicare
in the near future.  

Published
studies have shown that the use of ultrapure dialysate can reduce the overall need for erythropoietin stimulating agents ( ESA ),
expensive drugs used in conjunction with HD. By reducing the level of dialysate contaminants, specifically cytokine-inducing substances
that can pass into a patient s blood stream, the stimulation of inflammation-inducing cytokines is reduced, thus reducing
systemic inflammation. When inflammation is low, inflammatory morbidities are reduced and a patient s responsiveness to
erythropoietin ( EPO ) is enhanced, consequently the overall need for ESAs is reduced.  

We
believe that our ultrafilters are attractive to dialysis centers because they exceed currently approved and newly proposed standards
for water and bicarbonate concentrate purity, assist in achieving those standards and may help dialysis centers reduce costs associated
with the amount of ESA required to treat a patient. Our in-line filters are easily installed into the fluid circuits supplying
water and bicarbonate concentrate just prior to entering each dialysis machine.  

In
March 2016, we launched the SSUmini product, developed to provide a lower cost ultrafiltration solution for water and bicarbonate
flowrates of 0.5 gallons per minutes ( GPM ) or less. The SSUmini can be used as a polish filter for small, portable
reverse osmosis ( RO ) water systems or on bicarbonate concentrate lines in dialysis clinics with centralized bicarbonate
concentrate systems.  

The
endotoxin cartridge filter, EndoPurTM, is designed to provide hemodialysis quality water through ultrafiltration of the water
in a dialysis clinic s reverse osmosis loop. The EndoPurTM filter retains particles as small as 0.005 microns, is designed
to handle higher flowrates and will be offered in 10 , 20 , 30  or 40  sizes upon FDA clearance. In April
2016, we filed for Special 510(k) clearance of an endotoxin cartridge filter. Because we believed that the EndoPurTM conformed
to the design controls of the SSU-D, and had the same intended use, we believed that the cartridge qualified for the Special 510(k):
Device Modification process. In May 2016, after discussion with the FDA, we converted the submission to a traditional 510(k) for
the 20 , 30  and 40  versions of the EndoPurTM cartridge and filed a Special 510(k) for the 10  version
of the EndoPurTM cartridge. On July 1, 2016, the FDA sent us a request for additional information. Following our meeting with
the FDA on August 15, 2016, and additional follow-up communications, we converted the EndoPur 10  cartridge submission to
a traditional 510(k), and initiated some additional biocompatibility studies and other related testing of our products. The testing
was completed in early November and we will submit the additional information for the EndoPur  10  cartridge Traditional
510(k) before the end of November 2016. We expect to submit the full package for a traditional 510(k) for the EndoPur  20 ,
30  and 40  ultrafilters by the middle of December 2016.  

Military
and Outdoor Recreation . Water is a key requirement for the soldier to be fully mission-capable. The availability of water
supplies and immediate on-site water purification is critical to enhance the ability to operate in any environment. Currently,
the military is heavily reliant on the use of bottled water to support its soldiers in the field. Bottled water is not always
available, is very costly to move, is resource intensive, and is prone to constant supply disruptions. Soldiers conducting operations
in isolated and rugged terrain must be able to use available local water sources when unable to resupply from bulk drinking water
sources or bottled water. Therefore, the soldier needs the capability to purify water from indigenous water sources in the absence
of available potable water. Soldiers must have the ability to remove microbiological contaminants in the water to Environmental
Protection Agency ( EPA ) specified levels.  

We
developed our individual water treatment device ( IWTD ) in both in-line and point-of-use configurations. Our IWTD
allows a soldier in the field to derive drinking water from any fresh water source. This enables the soldier to remain hydrated,
which will maintain mission effectiveness and unit readiness, and extend mission reach. Our IWTD is one of the few portable filters
that has been validated by the military to meet the NSF Protocol P248 standard. It has also been approved by U.S. Army Public
Health Command and U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command for deployment.  

On
May 6, 2015, we entered into a Sublicense Agreement with CamelBak Products, LLC ( CamelBak ). Under this Sublicense
Agreement, we granted CamelBak an exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide (with the exception of Italy) sublicense and license,
in each case solely to market, sell, distribute, import and export the IWTD. In exchange for the rights granted to CamelBak, CamelBak
agreed, through December 31, 2022, to pay us a percentage of the gross profit on any sales made to a branch of the U.S. military,
subject to certain exceptions, and to pay us a fixed per-unit fee for any other sales made. CamelBak is also required to meet
or exceed certain minimum annual fees payable to us, and if such fees are not met or exceeded, we may convert the exclusive sublicense
to a non-exclusive sublicense with respect to non-U.S. military sales. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
we recognized royalty revenue of $10,000 related to the Sublicense Agreement with CamelBak.  

In
2015, we began working with multiple companies developing portable water purification systems designed to provide potable water
in remote locations. Specifically, we have provided flushable filter prototypes to these companies for validation as one potential
component in systems that employ multiple technologies to purify water from streams, lakes and rivers.  

Commercial
Facilitie s. In 2014, we launched NanoGuard-D and NanoGuard-S in-line ultrafilters for the filtration of water which is to
be used for non-medical drinking and washing in non-transient non-community water systems, or commercial facilities. The NanoGuard-D
and NanoGuard-S trap particulates greater than 0.005 micons in size and can be used as a component of a facility water treatment
system, or to filter water used in ice machines and soda fountains.  

In
November 2015, we announced a strategic partnership with Biocon 1, LLC. Biocon 1 s AETHER  Water Systems technology,
which includes patented water filtration media and water filtration products, provides solutions for customers to address all
contaminate issues and to provide clean-tasting, sediment-free, scale-free, and bacteria-free water for the food service industry.
AETHER  Water Systems are used with ice machines, coffee stations, and soda fountains in hotels, casual dining restaurants,
fast food restaurants and convenience stores. As part of the collaboration, we have access to Biocon 1 s anti-scale and
related water filtration technology to develop filter products for the medical industry. In March 2016, Nephros shipped the first
lot of filter cartridges to Biocon 1 for inclusion with its AETHER  line of filtration products. Also in March 2016, Biocon
1 shipped the first anti-scale filter samples to Nephros for testing in the medical setting.  

While
our EndoPur TM  ultrafilter cartridge platform was designed initially for use in the dialysis setting, we are working
with our distributors to identify other opportunities for our ultrafilters to provide value to customers in multiple commercial
and industrial settings. The NanoGuard-C, a 10  cartridge filter that inserts into standard 10  housings, will be
available on a limited basis in the fourth quarter of 2016, and we expect to make the product broadly available in 2017.  

Many
potential customers in the commercial and industrial space currently utilize an Everpure  filter system. The NanoGuard-E,
a version of our ultrafilter that plugs into an Everpure  housing system, is now available on a limited basis and will be
available more broadly in 2017.  

Over
the last few years, we have been developing a high-throughput, auto-flushing filter system capable of handling 25 GPM, or greater,
through our proprietary 0.005 micron fiber membrane. The flushable filter system is designed to remove submicron particulates
in closed loop water systems, including cooling systems for data centers and hot water return loops in commercial buildings. Initial
data suggests the ability to remove both organic and inorganic particulates. We have released a limited number of systems to specific
customers for additional testing and validation.  

We
intend to develop flushable filter cartridges capable to filtering 2.5, 5 and 10 GPM through our fiber membrane. These smaller
flushable filter systems have potential utility as a point-of-entry water purification system in restaurants, convenience stores
and households. We intend to provide limited release of these products in the fourth quarter of 2016.  

Going
forward, as we grow our water filtration business, we will be exploring opportunities for new applications for our filter products
and will be open to evaluating new potential partnerships to expand our water filtration foot print.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

The
discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated
interim financial statements. These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared following the requirements
of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X for interim
periods and require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related
to going concern, allowance for doubtful accounts, reserve for inventory obsolescence, impairment analysis of capitalized license
fees, and share-based compensation expense. As these are condensed consolidated financial statements, you should also read expanded
information about our critical accounting policies and estimates provided in  Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. There
have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from the information provided in our Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers,  related to revenue recognition. The underlying principle of the
new standard is that a business or other organization will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services
to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects to be entitled to in exchange for the goods or services. The standard
also requires more detailed disclosures and provides additional guidance for transactions that were not addressed completely in
prior accounting guidance. ASU 2014-09 provides alternative methods of initial adoption, and was to be effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption was not permitted. In August
2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date.  The amendment
in this ASU defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities for one year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit
entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted only for fiscal years beginning
after December 31, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that fiscal year. We are currently reviewing the revised guidance
and assessing the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.  

In
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure
of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.  ASU 2014-15 provides guidance about management s
responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and
sets rules for how this information should be disclosed in the financial statements. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods
ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating any impact
the adoption of ASU 2014-15 might have on our consolidated financial statements.  

In
July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,  that requires inventory be measured
at the lower of cost and net realizable value and options that currently exist for market value to be eliminated. The standard
defines net realizable value as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs
of completion, disposal, and transportation and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods
within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The guidance should be applied prospectively. We do not believe that
the adoption of ASU 2015-11 will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.  

In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,  that requires that deferred
tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement
that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is
not affected by this amendment. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning
after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted and the standard may be applied either retrospectively or on a prospective
basis to all deferred tax assets and liabilities. We do not believe that the adoption of ASU 2015-17 will have a significant impact
on our consolidated financial statements.  

In
January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, 
that modifies certain aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The accounting
standard update is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, and
early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on our
financial statements.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases,  that discusses how an entity should account for lease assets
and lease liabilities. The guidance specifies that an entity who is a lessee under lease agreements should recognize lease assets
and lease liabilities for those leases classified as operating leases under previous FASB guidance. Accounting for leases by lessors
is largely unchanged under the new guidance. The guidance is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2019. Early adoption
is permitted. In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest
period presented using a modified retrospective approach. We are evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated
financial statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,  Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), 
which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The amendments in this update do not change
the core principle of ASU 2014-09. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this update are the same
as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU 2014-09. As discussed above, ASU 2015-14 defers the effective date of
ASU 2014-09 by one year. We are currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on our financial
statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  which simplifies
several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification
of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for us
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact of adopting this
guidance on our consolidated financial statements.  

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,  Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,  which clarifies the
implementation guidance for performance obligations and licensing. The amendments in this update do not change the core principle
of ASU 2014-09. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this update are the same as the effective
date and transition requirements of ASU 2014-09. As discussed above, ASU 2015-14 defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one
year. We are currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on our financial statements.  

In
May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,  Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,  which clarifies the accounting
for certain aspects of guidance issued in ASU 2014-09, including assessing collectability and noncash consideration. The clarifications
in this update do not change the core principle of ASU 2014-09. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments
in this update are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU 2014-09. As discussed above, ASU 2015-14
defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. We are currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting
guidance will have on its financial statements.  

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,  which replaces the
incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration
of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The guidance is effective for us
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. Early adoption is permitted beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year
2019. We are evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,  which clarifies
how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows in order to reduce diversity
in practice. The guidance is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. Early adoption is permitted.
We are evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.  

Results
of Operations   

Fluctuations
in Operating Results   

Our
results of operations have fluctuated significantly from period to period in the past and are likely to continue to do so in the
future. We anticipate that our quarterly results of operations will be impacted for the foreseeable future by several factors
including the progress and timing of expenditures related to our research and development efforts, as well as marketing expenses
related to product launches. Due to these fluctuations, we believe that the period to period comparisons of our operating results
are not a good indication of our future performance.  

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    

Revenues   

Total
net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $475,000 compared to approximately $320,000 for
the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of approximately $155,000, or 48%. This increase was primarily caused by
an increase in hospital filter revenues that was offset by a decrease in dialysis filter and hemodiafiltration revenues.  

Cost
of Goods Sold   

Cost
of goods sold was approximately $159,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately $154,000 for
the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase of approximately $5,000, or 3%, during the three months ended September
30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 is primarily due to an increase in units sold of approximately 10% during the three
months ended September 30, 2016. The cost of goods did not increase proportionally with revenue because direct sales were higher
during the three months ended September 30, 2016 than in the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

Research
and Development Expenses   

Research
and development expenses were approximately $241,000 and $226,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September
30, 2015, respectively. This increase of approximately $15,000, or 7%, is primarily due to additional salary and stock compensation
expenses for increased research and development personnel, offset by a decrease in expenses related to product development.  

Depreciation
and Amortization Expense   

Depreciation
and amortization expense was approximately $60,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately $53,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Amortization expense related to the asset recognized in conjunction with the License
and Supply Agreement with Medica S.p.A was $53,000 for each of the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The remaining
$7,000 recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2016 was depreciation on property and equipment.  

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses   

Selling,
general and administrative expenses were approximately $652,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately
$974,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $322,000 or 33%. The decrease is primarily
due to decreased professional service fees, including regulatory consulting and legal services, which were partially offset by
additional salary and benefit expenses for increased selling, general and administrative personnel and by increased marketing
expenses.  

Change
in Fair Value of Warrant Liability   

Certain
warrants were classified as liabilities at their fair value and adjusted to their fair value at each reporting period. The fair
value of such warrants issued was estimated using a binomial options pricing model. For the three months ended September 30, 2015,
the change in fair value of the warrant liability was an increase of approximately $2,287,000. These liability-classified warrants
were exercised in full on September 29, 2015.  

Warrant
Modification Expense   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2015, the modification of the exercise price of the liability-classified warrants resulted
in an increase in the warrant liability, immediately before exercise, of approximately $1,761,000.  

Interest
Expense   

Interest
expense of approximately $65,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is comprised of approximately $33,000 of interest
related to the June 2016 Note and Warrant Agreement, approximately $23,000 related to the amortization of debt discount and approximately
$9,000 of interest due on outstanding payables to a vendor. Interest expense of approximately $9,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015 related to interest due on outstanding payables owed to a vendor.  

Interest
Income   

Interest
income of approximately $1,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 related to interest income recognized on a lease
receivable.  

Other
Income (Expense)   

Other
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 of approximately $5,000 and $11,000, respectively, are related
to foreign currency losses on invoices paid to an international supplier.  

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    

Revenues   

Total
net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $1,575,000 compared to approximately $1,433,000 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Total net revenues increased approximately $142,000, or 10%, arising from an increase
in hospital filter revenue, which was partially offset by a decrease in dialysis filter revenue.  

Cost
of Goods Sold   

Cost
of goods sold was approximately $667,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately $626,000 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase of approximately $41,000, or 7%, is primarily due to adjustments in inventory
reserve in the periods.  

Research
and Development Expenses   

Research
and development expenses were approximately $763,000 and $582,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30,
2015, respectively. This increase of approximately $181,000, or 31%, is primarily due to additional salary and stock compensation
expenses for increased research and development personnel, partially offset by a decrease in product development expenses.  

Depreciation
and Amortization Expense   

Depreciation
and amortization expense was approximately $171,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately $159,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Amortization expense related to the asset recognized in conjunction with the License
and Supply Agreement with Medica S.p.A was $157,000 and $158,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The remaining $14,000 and $1,000 recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, was depreciation
on property and equipment.  

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses   

Selling,
general and administrative expenses were approximately $2,234,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately
$2,551,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $317,000, or 12%. The decrease is primarily
due to decreased professional service fees, including regulatory consulting and legal services, which were offset by additional
salary and benefit expenses for increased selling, general and administrative personnel and by increased marketing expenses.  

Change
in Fair Value of Warrant Liability   

Certain
warrants were classified as liabilities at their fair value and adjusted to their fair value at each reporting period. The fair
value of such warrants issued have been estimated using a binomial options pricing model. For the nine months ended September
30, 2015, the change in fair value of the warrant liability was an increase of approximately $2,099,000. These liability-classified
warrants were exercised in full on September 29, 2015.  

Warrant
Modification Expense   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the modification of the exercise price of the liability-classified warrants resulted
in an increase in the warrant liability, immediately before exercise, of approximately $1,761,000.  

Interest
Expense   

Interest
expense of approximately $109,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of approximately $43,000 of interest
related to the June 2016 Note and Warrant Agreement, approximately $29,000 related the amortization of debt discount and approximately
$37,000 of interest due on outstanding payables to a vendor. Interest expense of approximately $30,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 relates to interest due on outstanding payables owed to a vendor.  

Interest
Income

Income (Expense)   

Other
expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of approximately $12,000 related to foreign currency losses of approximately
$14,000 on invoices paid to an international supplier offset partially by miscellaneous other income of approximately $2,000.
A foreign currency gain was recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of approximately $24,000 on invoices paid
to an international supplier.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

The
following table summarizes our liquidity and capital resources as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 and is intended to supplement
the more detailed discussion that follows. The amounts stated are expressed in thousands.  

At
September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $119,630,000 and we expect to incur additional operating losses
in the foreseeable future at least until such time, if ever, that we are able to increase product sales or license revenue. We
have financed our operations since inception primarily through the private placements of equity and debt securities, our initial
public offering, license revenue, and rights offerings.  

Our
future liquidity sources and requirements will depend on many factors, including:  

the
    availability of additional financing, through the sale of equity securities or otherwise, on commercially reasonable terms
    or at all;   

the
    market acceptance of our products, and our ability to effectively and efficiently produce and market our products;   

the
    continued progress in, and the costs of, clinical studies and other research and development programs;   

the
    costs involved in filing and enforcing patent claims and the status of competitive products; and   

the
    cost of litigation, including potential patent litigation and any other actual or threatened litigation.   

We
expect to put our current capital resources to the following uses:  

for
    the marketing and sales of our water-filtration products;   

to
    pursue business development opportunities with respect to our chronic renal treatment system; and   

for
    working capital purposes.   

At
September 30, 2016, we had cash totaling approximately $807,000 and total assets of approximately $1,695,000, excluding other
intangible assets (related to the Medica License and Supply Agreement) of approximately $1,315,000.  

On
June 7, 2016, we received gross proceeds of approximately $1,187,000 in connection with the issuance of unsecured promissory notes
and warrants.  

On
December 23, 2015, we received proceeds of approximately $688,000 in connection with our offer to holders of certain warrants
of the opportunity to exercise their warrants at a temporarily reduced cash exercise price. Warrant holders elected to exercise
warrants to purchase an aggregate of 3,442,521 shares of our common stock at the reduced cash exercise price of $0.20 per share,
providing a total of $688,000 in gross proceeds to us. Of the 3,442,521 shares issued, 2,782,577 are held by Lambda. The warrants
that were not exercised pursuant to the offer to exercise remained in effect through the original expiration date, with an exercise
price of $0.40 per share of common stock.  

On
September 29, 2015, we entered into a Warrant Amendment and Exercise Agreement (the  Amendment ) with Lambda. Pursuant
to the Amendment, we agreed to reduce the current exercise price of the Class D Warrant issued to Lambda on November 14, 2007
(together with all amendments thereto entered into prior to the Amendment, the  Warrant ) representing the right to
purchase 11,742,100 shares of our common stock by 50%, to $0.15 per share, in exchange for Lambda s agreement to exercise
such Warrant in its entirety. Upon exercise of the Warrant, we issued 11,742,100 shares of common stock to Lambda and received
approximately $1.76 million in cash proceeds from Lambda. Following such exercise, no Class D Warrants remain outstanding.  

Based
on our current projections, we expect that our existing cash balances and our projected increases in product sales from the launch
of new products, will allow us to fund our operations at least into the first quarter of 2017, if not longer, depending on the
timing and market acceptance of our new products. This assumption excludes the impact of future cash receipts from recurring operations.
Our cash flow currently is not, and historically has not been, sufficient to meet our obligations and commitments. We must seek
and obtain additional financing to fund our operations. If we cannot raise sufficient capital, in connection with offerings of
our common stock or through other means, we will be forced to curtail our planned activities and operations or cease operations
entirely and you will lose all of your investment in our Company. There can be no assurance that we could raise sufficient capital
on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms or at all.  

Net
cash used in operating activities was approximately $1,584,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately
$2,575,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $991,000. Excluding the noncash impact of
the change in fair value of the warrant liability and warrant modification of approximately $338,000 during the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, our net loss was approximately $2,377,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately
$2,491,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $114,000.  

The
most significant items contributing to the net decrease of approximately $991,000 in cash used in operating activities during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 are highlighted below:  

Partially
offsetting the above changes:  

Net
cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $45,000 as a result of the purchase
of property and equipment.  

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $1,188,000 resulted from net proceeds of
approximately $1,187,000 from the issuance of unsecured notes payable and approximately $1,000 of proceeds resulting from the
exercise of warrants.  

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of approximately $3,102,000 resulted from net
proceeds of approximately $1,340,000 from the issuance of common stock and approximately $1,762,000 of proceeds resulting from
the exercise of warrants.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2016 or 2015.  

Forward-Looking
Statements   

Certain
statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q constitute  forward-looking statements.  Such statements include
statements regarding the efficacy and intended use of our technologies under development, our expectations regarding the timing
of products approvals or clearances, the timelines for bringing such products to market or for deploying such products for research
purposes, the availability of funding sources for continued development of such products, the anticipated development of future
products, our expectations regarding sales and revenue, and other statements that are not historical facts, including statements
which may be preceded by the words  intends,   may,   will,   plans,   expects, 
 anticipates,   projects,   predicts,   estimates,   aims,   believes, 
 hopes,   potential  or similar words. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance,
are based on certain assumptions and are subject to various known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond
our control. Actual results may differ materially from the expectations contained in the forward-looking statements. Factors that
may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, the risks that:  

we
    may not be able to continue as a going concern;   

we
    face significant challenges in obtaining market acceptance of our products, which could adversely affect our potential sales
    and revenues;   

product-related
    deaths or serious injuries or product malfunctions could trigger recalls, class action lawsuits and other events that could
    cause us to incur expenses and may also limit our ability to generate revenues from such products;   

we
    face potential liability associated with the production, marketing and sale of our products and the expense of defending against
    claims of product liability, could materially deplete our assets and generate negative publicity which could impair our reputation;   

to
    the extent our products or marketing materials are found to violate any provisions of the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act
    or any other statutes or regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions by the FDA or other governmental agencies;   

we
    may not be able to obtain funding if and when needed or on terms favorable to us in order to continue operations;   

we
    may not have sufficient capital to successfully implement our business plan;   

we
    may not be able to effectively market our products;   

we
    may not be able to sell our water filtration products or chronic renal failure therapy products at competitive prices or profitably;   

we
    may encounter problems with our suppliers, manufacturers and distributors;   

we
    may encounter unanticipated internal control deficiencies or weaknesses or ineffective disclosure controls and procedures;   

we
    may not obtain appropriate or necessary regulatory approvals to achieve our business plan;   

products
    that appeared promising to us in research or clinical trials may not demonstrate anticipated efficacy, safety or cost savings
    in subsequent pre-clinical or clinical trials;   

we
    may not be able to secure or enforce adequate legal protection, including patent protection, for our products; and   

we
    may not be able to achieve sales growth in key geographic markets.   

More
detailed information about us and the risk factors that may affect the realization of forward-looking statements, including the
forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is set forth in our filings with the SEC, including our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and our other periodic reports filed with the SEC. We urge investors
and security holders to read those documents free of charge at the SEC s web site at www.sec.gov. We do not undertake to
publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as
required by law.

Not
required for smaller reporting companies.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

We
maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), which is designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required
to be disclosed in our reports filed pursuant to the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely manner.
Management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Because there are inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud have been or will be detected.  

At
the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with
the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer, regarding the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered
by this report were effective.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
