 Business and Organization

Siguler Guff Small Business Credit Opportunities Fund, Inc. ( SBCOF  or the  Company ), was incorporated in Maryland on July 7, 2014 as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company and elected status as a business development company (a  BDC ) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the  1940 Act ) on July 1, 2015.  Siguler Guff Advisers, LLC (the  Investment Manager ) serves as the Company s Investment Manager.  The Investment Manager is an investment adviser registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, pursuant to the 1940 Act.  One hundred percent of the stock of the Company is held by Siguler Guff Small Business Credit Opportunities Fund, LP (the  Partnership ).  Prior to commencing its operations on October 13, 2015, the Company had no operations other than the issuance to the Partnership of 100,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value for $25,000 in September 2014.

The Company s investment objective is to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns by generating current income from debt investments.  There can be no assurance that the Company will attain its investment objective.  The Company will typically invest in U.S. companies in the lower middle market segment. The Investment Manager defines the  lower middle market  as privately-owned companies with between $2-15 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ( EBITDA ), and between $10-100 million of revenue.  Investments take the form of mezzanine debt as well as some  unitranche  loans with a first lien on a company s assets, as well as second lien loans.  The Partnership generally will seek to purchase equity securities alongside the Company s investments into those same companies, generally with an aggregate cost of up to 20% of the value of the Company s total investment.  The Company also may extend mezzanine financing in forms other than subordinated loans, such as convertible loans and preferred stock.

The Company jointly co-invests in investments alongside the Partnership and Siguler Guff SBCOF Parallel Fund, LP (the  Parallel Partnership ) and may co-invest with other investment funds managed by or otherwise affiliated with the Investment Manager (collectively, the  Affiliated Funds ).  The Company and the Affiliated Funds generally invest pro-rata and  pari passu  with each other in investments, except when tax, regulatory or investment restrictions prevent the Company or the Affiliated Funds from investing.  The General Partner of the Partnership and Parallel Partnership is an Affiliate of the Investment Manager.

The Company is subject to certain investment guidelines and restrictions as set forth in its registration statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10.

 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company included herein were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information and with the instructions to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The information furnished includes all adjustments and accruals of a normal recurring nature, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair statement of results for the interim periods.  The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire year or any subsequent interim period.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

September 30, 2016  

These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, which are included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 29, 2016.

Basis of Accounting

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions.  These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from these estimates and such differences could be material.  The most significant estimates inherent in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements are the valuation of investments and revenue recognition.

The Company is an investment company and follows the accounting and reporting guidance as prescribed by Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 946,  Financial Services   Investment Companies  ( ASC 946 ).

The financial statements include portfolio investments at fair value of $13,008,361 at September 30, 2016 and $6,833,511 at December 31, 2015. The portfolio investments represent 103% of net assets at September 30, 2016 and 106% of net assets at December 31, 2015 and their fair values have been determined in good faith by the Company's Board of Directors ( Directors ). Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, the determined values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for the investments, and the differences could be material.

Consolidation

The Company has certain wholly-owned subsidiaries, including subsidiaries that are not consolidated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which hold certain portfolio investments of the Company.  These subsidiaries are consolidated with the Company for accounting purposes, and the portfolio investments held by the subsidiaries are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements as investments.  All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  The investments held through the subsidiaries are reflected in the Consolidated Schedule of Portfolio Investments in addition to any investments the Company holds directly.  As provided under Regulation S-X and ASC 946, the Company will generally not consolidate its investment in a company other than a wholly-owned investment company or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to the Company.  Accordingly, the Company consolidated the results of certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries in its financial statements.

Valuation of Portfolio Investments

The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  ("ASC 820") defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A liability's fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available or reliable, valuation techniques are applied. These valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the investments or market and the investments' complexity.

Siguler Guff Small Business Credit Opportunities Fund, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

September 30, 2016  

Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the Company's consolidated financial statements are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value.  Hierarchical levels, defined by ASC 820 and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities, are as follows:

Level 1 - Unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.

Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data at the measurement date for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that reflect management's best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model.

Under ASC 820, the Company performs detailed valuations of its debt investments for which quotations are not readily available on an individual basis, using bond yield, market and income approaches as appropriate. In certain instances, the Company may use alternative methodologies, including recent purchase transactions, asset liquidation, expected recovery model or other alternative approaches to estimate the fair value.

Financial instruments with readily available quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment inherent in measuring fair value.

Under the bond yield approach, the Company uses bond yield models to determine the present value of the future cash flow streams of its debt investments. The Company reviews various sources of transactional data, including private mergers and acquisitions involving debt investments with similar characteristics, and assesses the information in the valuation process.

Under the market approach, the Company estimates the enterprise value of the portfolio companies in which it invests. There is no one methodology to estimate enterprise value and, in fact, for any one portfolio company, enterprise value is best expressed as a range of fair values, from which the Company derives a single estimate of enterprise value. To estimate the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the Company analyzes various factors, including the portfolio company's historical and projected financial results. Typically, private companies are valued based on multiples of EBITDA, cash flows, net income or revenues. The Company generally requires portfolio companies to provide annual audited and quarterly or monthly unaudited financial statements, as well as annual projections for the upcoming fiscal year.

Under the income approach, the Company generally prepares and analyzes discounted cash flow models based on projections of the future free cash flows of the business.

The fair value of the Company's portfolio investments at  September 30, 2016  and December 31, 2015 was determined in good faith by the Directors. The Directors are ultimately responsible for the valuation of the portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to the Company's valuation policy.  Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, these estimated fair values do not necessarily represent amounts that might be ultimately realized and the differences could be material.

The following table summarizes the level of the Company s assets measured at fair value as of  September 30, 2016  and December 31, 2015. 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, 100% of the Company s portfolio investments have been classified within Level 3.  Assumptions used by the Company due to the lack of observable inputs may significantly impact the resulting fair value and therefore the Company's results of operations.  The following table summarizes the significant unobservable inputs the Company used to value investments categorized within Level 3.  The below table is not intended to be all-inclusive, but instead captures the significant unobservable inputs relevant to the determination of fair values:

The following is a rollforward of the portfolio investments in which significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) were used in determining fair value:

Fair Value Measurements using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)      

Net change in unrealized gain/(loss) and net realized gain/(loss), if any, on Level 3 portfolio investments in the table above are included in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations.  For the period ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company has a net change in unrealized gain of $0 on Level 3 portfolio investments still held by the Company as of the financial statement date.

Investments

Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date unless there are substantial conditions to the purchase.  Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment. Unrealized gains or losses primarily reflect the change in investment values, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses when gains or losses are realized. Realized gains or losses on the disposition of investments are calculated using the specific identification method.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consists of cash held at a bank and highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased, such as overnight deposits which are held by the Company at one United States financial institution.  During the period, the balances held at the financial institution may at times exceed federally insured limits.

Income and Expense

Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected.  The Company stops accruing interest on investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible.  Fees received upon closing a transaction generally are treated as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment.  Any resulting discount, or closing fee received, from recording the loan or otherwise purchasing a security at a discount, is accreted into interest income over the life of the loan using the effective-yield method.

The Company has investments in debt securities which contain payment-in-kind ("PIK") interest provisions.  PIK interest is computed at the contractual rate specified in each investment agreement and added to the principal balance of the investment and recorded as interest income.  The Company stops accruing PIK interest on investments when it is determined that PIK interest is no longer collectible.

Expenses include investment management fees, legal fees, directors' fees, audit and tax service expenses, and other general and administrative expenses.  Expenses are recognized on an accrual basis.

Income Taxes

During the period ended  September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , the Company did not qualify to be treated as a regulated investment company, or RIC, for federal income tax purposes.  As such, the Company will be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.   It is anticipated that, by the end of the second year of its investment operations, the Company will seek to meet the requirements, including diversification, gross income, and distribution requirements, to qualify for the special pass-through status available to RICs under the Internal Revenue Code, and thus to be relieved of federal income tax on that part of its net investment income and realized capital gains that it distributes.  Unless and until the Company meets these requirements, it will be taxed as a corporation on its taxable income for that year even if that income is distributed to the Partnership (its sole stockholder), and all distributions out of its earnings and profits will be taxable as dividends to the investors of the Partnership; thus, such income will be subject to two layers of tax (although corporate Limited Partners may be entitled to a dividends-received deduction).  There is no assurance that the Company will meet the requirements to qualify as a RIC or be able to maintain such status.

Income taxes payable/(receivable) and prepaid taxes, including deferred benefits, consists of the following:

Table of Contents

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

September 30, 2016  

The provision for income taxes is composed of the following charges/(benefits):

(1) 
 
 The current federal income tax (benefit)/expense is net of the use of federal net operating losses totaling $45,939.

(2) 
 
 The current state income tax (benefit)/expense is net of the use of state net operating losses totaling $41,822.

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

The deferred tax assets and liabilities have been recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities as follows:

The Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized.  In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations.  As of December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a valuation allowance against its total deferred tax assets as the Company did not expect to realize the benefits from these assets prior to when the Company qualifies as a RIC for federal income tax purposes.

As of September 30, 2016, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that an amount of the deferred tax assets, relating to the period prior to RIC qualification, would be utilized. Consequently, the Company has reversed a substantial portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance during the period ended September 30, 2016.  The positive evidence for such reduction was positive earnings for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 and the expectation of earnings going forward in the future. Potentially offsetting this positive evidence is the fact that the Company had a loss before income taxes for the period ended December 31, 2015. If the Company determines that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, it would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.

At  December 31, 2015 , the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $45,939 to offset future federal taxable income, to the extent provided by U.S. federal income tax law.  The Company had state net operating loss carryforwards of $41,822 to offset future state taxable income, to the extent provided by state income tax law. As of  September 30, 2016 , the Company used $87,761 of prior net operating loss carryforwards to offset federal and state taxable income. 

The effective tax rate varied from the statutory federal income tax rates. The effective tax rate is affected by a number of factors, the most significant of which has been the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets.

The Company records uncertain tax positions in accordance with  FASB ASC 740,   Income Taxes   (  ASC 740 ) on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) it determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, it recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. The Company has determined that there are no uncertain tax positions that would have a material impact to the financial statements of the Company and therefore provisions are required to be recorded by the Company. The Company does not anticipate significant increases to uncertain tax positions in the next twelve months. The Company will recognize any interest and penalties, if applicable, for any uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. No interest or penalties were recorded during the period ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 or accrued for as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

The Company files tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates.  In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by federal, state, local and foreign jurisdictions, where applicable.  At September 30, 2016, no examinations were being conducted by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.  Under the respective statute of limitations, tax years beginning in 2015 remain subject to examination by the various tax jurisdictions.

 Portfolio Investments

As of September 30, 2016, the Company held debt investments in six companies and as of December 31, 2015, held debt investments in three companies.  The terms and conditions of those investments, including restrictions on resale, are subject to the terms of the companies  purchase and sale agreements, limited partnership agreements, private placement memoranda and other governing documents.

Purchases of portfolio investments for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 totaled $6,079,884.  There were no sales, repayments or other exits of investments during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016.

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the cost of portfolio investments for federal income tax purposes was $13,103,084 and $6,833,511, respectively. There was no net unrealized appreciation of portfolio investments for federal income tax purposes.

The Company s investment holdings are illiquid and subject to redemption/resale restrictions in accordance with their respective agreements.

The Company s investments are subject to general economic, political and market risk.  These factors may affect the level and volatility of prices and the liquidity of Portfolio Investments, which could adversely affect the Company s profitability or result in losses.

In addition, the Company is subject to credit risk (the risk that an issuer or borrower will default in the payment of principal and/or interest on an instrument), interest rate risk (the risks associated with market changes in interest rates), illiquidity risk/risks of investing in smaller and lower middle market size companies (the risk that the Portfolio Investment will decline sharply after its purchase, whether because of adverse developments affecting that security or a general withdrawal of capital from the small and lower middle market) and concentration/lack of diversification risk (various factors, including prevailing market conditions, available investment opportunities, regulatory constraints, constraints imposed by certain portfolio companies, and the timing of investments, may prevent the Investment Manager from diversifying the Company s portfolio or may result in the Company s portfolio not being as diversified as the Investment Manager may otherwise prefer).

Lastly, the Company is subject to subordination of interest risk.  Portfolio Investments may be in subordinated loans, structurally subordinated loans, mezzanine loans and other structured investments and preferred equity interests or equity interests of an issuer.  These Portfolio Investments will be subordinated to the senior obligations of the property or issuer, either contractually, structurally or inherently due to the nature of the securities.  Greater credit risks are usually attached to these subordinated investments than to investments in senior obligations.  In addition, these securities may not be protected by financial or other covenants, such as limitations upon additional indebtedness, typically protecting the senior debt, and may have limited liquidity.

 Capital Stock

The Company is owned entirely by the Partnership, to which the Company sold 100,000 shares ( Initial Shares ), at a price of $0.25 per share in an offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ( 1933 Act ) pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) and Regulation D ( Regulation D ) thereof.    The Partnership offers and sells limited partnership interests (the  Interests ) to investors (the  Limited Partners ) in an offering exempt from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act pursuant to Regulation D, and will sell its Interests in offerings solely to persons that are both  accredited investors , as that term is defined in Regulation D, and  qualified purchasers  within the meaning of the 1940 Act.    To the extent called for by the Company, the Partnership, subject to its approval of the need for such funds, may make further contributions to the capital ( LP Contributions ) of the Company to the extent of the Limited Partners  capital commitment to the Partnership ( Committed Equity Capital ).  Total Committed Equity Capital of the Partnership is $16,710,000.  Total contributed capital to the Partnership through September 30, 2016 was $16,626,450, of which $12,836,358 was contributed to the Company.  The Partnership intends to seek additional capital commitments from investors; if the Partnership is unsuccessful, fixed expenses will continue to have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations.

Two Limited Partners of the Partnership have Committed Equity Capital in excess of ten percent of the total Committed Equity Capital of the Partnership, which cumulatively represent approximately 90% of the total Committed Equity Capital of the Partnership.  The concentration of these partners  Committed Equity Capital could have a material effect on the Partnership and the Company in the event of default or other actions by these partners.

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were 10,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value common stock authorized, and 100,000 shares issued and outstanding.

 Related Party Transactions

The Company has a Board of Directors, a majority of whom are directors that are not  interested persons  of the Company, as defined in the 1940 Act (the  Independent Directors ).

 Fees and Expenses

As compensation for its services, the Investment Manager will receive an investment management fee from the Company (the  Investment Management Fee ).  The Investment Management Fee is paid by the Company quarterly in arrears in an amount equal to 1.75% per annum of the Company s Invested Capital, as measured as of the close of business on the last business day of such quarterly period.  Invested Capital  means the cost basis of the portfolio investments of the Company (excluding cash and cash equivalents) that have not been written off or disposed of, including portfolio investments acquired with borrowed funds. Invested Capital shall include the cost basis of any portfolio investments held indirectly through any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (if one is formed) that has obtained a license as a Small Business Investment Company from the U.S. Small Business Administration (a  SBIC Subsidiary ).  On March 29, 2016, the Investment Manager voluntarily agreed to reduce the Investment Management Fee to 1.25% per annum (effective as of the commencement of the Company s operations). This resulted in the Investment Manager waiving $48,588 and $15,597 for the nine month s ended September 30, 2016 and the three month s ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  The Investment Manager has no ability to claw back any Investment Management Fees waived.

The General Partner of the Partnership and Parallel Partnership also receives from the Partnership a share of any profits derived from the investments held by the Partnership and Parallel Partnership, including those of the Company.

8. 
 
 Contingencies

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts that contain a variety of representations and warranties which provide general indemnifications.  The Company s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Company that have not yet occurred.  However, based on experience, the Investment Manager expects the risk of loss to be remote.

 Financial Highlights

The following per share data and ratios have been derived from information provided in the consolidated financial statements. The following is a schedule of consolidated financial highlights for a common share outstanding for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016.

1 Given the Company s similarities to a non-registered close-ended fund, the Company calculated total return as the change in the Company's capital over the period ended, and adjusted for stockholder contributions and distributions during the period.  The Company noted that the total return calculated under the typical method for a registered investment company resulted in a total return of 95.62% (not annualized).  The Company determined this did not appropriately represent the performance of the Company, and thus calculated the total return based on the change in value of a theoretical investment at the beginning of the period by geometrically linking the cash flows, which is a method more commonly used by non-registered funds.

On October 7, 2016, the Partnership held an additional closing accepting Capital Commitments of $21,763,562, bringing Aggregate Capital Commitments to $38,473,562.

ITEM 2.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

Siguler Guff Small Business Credit Opportunities Fund, Inc. ( SBCOF  or the  Fund ) is a non-diversified closed-end management investment company electing status as a business development company ( BDC ) under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the  1940 Act ).  The Fund is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Siguler Guff Small Business Credit Opportunities Fund, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the  Partnership ).  The Partnership is the Fund s sole direct shareholder and makes capital contributions to the Fund as needed for the Fund to make investments or pay its expenses, to the extent that the Partnership has available capital and in accordance with the Partnership s governing documents.  The Fund s investment objective is to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns by generating current income from debt investments and capital appreciation from equity investments.

The Fund is a specialty finance investment company providing financing and advisory services to carefully selected companies in the lower middle market, which Siguler Guff Advisers (the  Investment Manager ) defines as privately-owned companies with between $2-15 million of earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ), and between $10-100 million of revenue. The Fund s investments generally take the form of mezzanine debt,  unitranche  loans with a first lien on the company s assets, as well as second lien loans.  The Partnership generally seeks to purchase equity securities alongside the Fund s investments into those same companies, generally with an aggregate cost of up to 20% of the value of the investment.  The Partnership also may extend mezzanine financing in forms other than subordinated loans, such as convertible loans and preferred stock. The Fund commenced investment operations on October 13, 2015, and its portfolio as of September 30, 2016 (excluding cash and cash equivalents) consisted of 6 investments comprising the healthcare services, manufacturing, processed and packaged goods, business equipment, commercial retail and security and protection services industries.

Table of Contents 

The Investment Manager will seek to increase the diversification of the Fund s portfolio so as to make it possible (commencing with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017) to meet the regulated investment company ( RIC ) diversification requirements under Section 851(b) of the Internal Revenue Code (the  Code ), although there is no assurance that the Fund will meet the RIC requirements at that time.  Until the Fund meets the requirements to qualify as a RIC, it will be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income for that year, regardless whether that income is distributed to the Partnership as the Fund s sole direct shareholder, and all distributions out of earnings and profits will be taxable to investors as ordinary dividend income ( i.e. , the Fund will be subject to a double layer of tax).

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Investment Manager has identified the most critical accounting estimates upon which the financial statements depend and determined the critical accounting estimates by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments.  The two critical accounting policies relate to the valuation of investments and the recognition of income and expense.

Valuation of Portfolio Investments

The Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  ( ASC 820 ), defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  A liability s fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor.  Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available or reliable, fair valuation techniques are applied.  These techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the investments or market and the investments  complexity.

Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the Fund s consolidated financial statements are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value.  Hierarchical levels, defined by ASC 820 and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs used in the fair valuation of these assets and liabilities, are as follows:

Level 1 - Unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.

Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data at the measurement date for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.  Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the fair valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model.

Under ASC 820, the Fund performs detailed valuations of its debt investments for which quotations are not readily available on an individual basis, using bond yield, market and income approaches as appropriate. In certain instances, the Fund may use alternative methodologies, including recent purchase transactions, asset liquidation, expected recovery model or other alternative approaches to estimate the fair value.

25 

Table of Contents 

Financial instruments with readily available quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment inherent in measuring fair value.

Under the bond yield approach, the Fund uses bond yield models to determine the present value of the future cash flow streams of its debt investments. The Fund reviews various sources of transactional data, including private mergers and acquisitions involving debt investments with similar characteristics, and assesses the information in the valuation process.

Under the market approach, the Fund estimates the enterprise value of the portfolio companies in which it invests. There is no one methodology to estimate enterprise value and, in fact, for any one portfolio company, enterprise value is best expressed as a range of fair values, from which the Fund derives a single estimate of enterprise value. To estimate the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the Fund analyzes various factors, including the portfolio company s historical and projected financial results. Typically, private companies are valued based on multiples of EBITDA, cash flows, net income or revenues. The Fund generally requires portfolio companies to provide annual audited and quarterly or monthly unaudited financial statements, as well as annual projections for the upcoming fiscal year.

Under the income approach, the Fund generally prepares and analyzes discounted cash flow models based on projections of the future free cash flows of the business.

The fair value of the Fund s portfolio investments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was determined in good faith by the Fund s Board of Directors. The Board of Directors is ultimately and solely responsible for the valuation of the portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to the Fund s valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process.

The following table summarizes the level of the Fund s assets measured at fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

26 

Table of Contents 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, 100% of the Fund s portfolio investments have been classified within Level 3.  Assumptions used by the Fund due to the lack of observable inputs may significantly impact fair value determinations and therefore the Fund s results of operations.  The following table summarizes the significant unobservable inputs the Fund used to value investments categorized within Level 3.  The below table is not intended to be all-inclusive, but instead captures the significant unobservable inputs relevant to the determination of fair values:

Critical factors in determining the fair value of investments include payment history, collateral position, financial strength of borrower, financial performance relative to covenants, likelihood of sale or acquisition of the borrower, and length of expected holding period of the loan, as well as the general interest rate environment. The actual value realized from investments may differ from management s estimates and such differences could be material.   In addition, such differences would impact the carrying value of investments presented in the financial statements, as well as, the Fund s change in net assets resulting from operations.

Income and Expense

Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected.  The Fund stops accruing interest on investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible.  Fees received upon closing a transaction generally are treated as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment.  Any resulting discount, or closing fee received, from recording the loan or otherwise purchasing a security at a discount, is accreted into interest income over the life of the loan using the effective-yield method.

The Fund has investments in debt securities which contain payment-in-kind ( PIK ) interest provisions.  PIK interest is computed at the contractual rate specified in each investment agreement and added to the principal balance of the investment and recorded as income.  The Fund stops accruing PIK interest on investments when it is determined that PIK interest is no longer collectible.

Expenses include investment management fees, legal fees, directors  fees, audit and tax expenses, and other general and administrative expenses.  Expenses are recognized on an accrual basis.

Results of Operations   For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016

The Fund commenced operations on October 13, 2015, so the operating results are limited. Total investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $386,336 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,009,075, which primarily consisted of interest income on investments held during the period.  The average outstanding principal amount of loans made by the Fund (calculated on a monthly basis) during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $11,062,821 and during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $10,019,319.

27 

Table of Contents 

At September 30, 2016, all investments held by the Fund incorporated fixed interest rates.  The weighted average interest rate on outstanding loans was 12.37% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Interest is calculated using the effective interest method, and rates earned by the Fund will fluctuate based on factors including, but not limited to, pre-payments of outstanding loans, defaults or uncollectibility of payments, and changes in interest rates.

Total Fund net expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $188,667. The three months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of investment management fees of $38,992 (gross fees of $54,589 less waived fees of $15,597), professional fees of $105,167, directors  fees of $41,250 and other expenses of $3,258. There was an income tax expense of $131,372 for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  Total Fund net expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $558,902. The nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of investment management fees of $95,274 (gross fees of $143,862 less waived fees of $48,588), professional fees of $331,630, directors  fees of $124,750 and other expenses of $7,248. There was an income tax expense of $107,968 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

The Fund s investment management fee, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, was computed and paid quarterly in arrears in an amount equal to 1.25% per annum of the Fund s Invested Capital, as measured as of the close of business on the last business day of each quarterly period.  Invested Capital  means the cost basis of the Fund s portfolio investments (excluding cash and cash equivalents) that have not been written off or disposed of, including portfolio investments acquired with borrowed funds, and excluding any portfolio investments held indirectly through any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Fund (if one is formed) that has obtained a license as a Small Business Investment Company from the U.S. Small Business Administration.  The Investment Manager has elected to voluntarily waive all management fees greater than 1.25% per annum of the Fund s invested capital.

The Fund s professional fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were comprised of legal, audit, tax and other professional fees. Other expenses included miscellaneous other expenses related to the operation of the Fund.

Net investment gain/(loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $66,297.  Net investment gain/(loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $342,205.  The Fund is continuing to make investments in income-producing assets and seeking additional capital commitments from investors in the Partnership; if the Fund is unsuccessful, its fixed expenses will continue to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations.

There was no realized/unrealized gain or loss from investments during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Net increase/(decrease) in net assets resulting from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $66,297.  Net increase/(decrease) in net assets resulting from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $342,205.

Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Fund was wholly owned by the Partnership. The Partnership is expected, but not required, to make further contributions of capital to the Fund in an aggregate amount that will not exceed the Partnership s limited partners  capital commitments to the Partnership.  From inception of the Partnership through September 30, 2016, the Partnership had received subscriptions for capital in the amount of $16,710,000, of which $16,626,450 had been called and of which $12,836,358 was contributed to the Fund.  As of September 30, 2016, $83,550 of capital remained uncalled by the Partnership.

At September 30, 2016, the Fund had adequate resources consisting of cash on hand and expected future capital contributions from the Partnership that could be used to fund future obligations.  The Fund, based upon the investments held at September 30, 2016, expects to receive approximately $1,490,000 in scheduled interest payments over the next year.  These amounts are sufficient to meet the requirements of anticipated investments and operational expenses of the Fund over the next year.

As of September 30, 2016, 1.59% of the Fund s net assets consisted of cash and cash equivalents.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Fund invested in senior subordinated notes. There were no distributions made by the Fund during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The principal balance and fair value of loans in the Fund s investment portfolio at September 30, 2016 were $13,234,176 and $13,008,361, respectively.

The Fund s consolidated financial statements include portfolio investments held at a fair value of $13,008,361 at September 30, 2016. The portfolio investments represent 103% of net assets at September 30, 2016 and their fair values have been determined in good faith by the Fund s Board of Directors. Because of the inherent uncertainty of fair valuation, the determined values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for the investments, and the differences could be material. Because the Fund s investments consist of privately negotiated transactions, investments in these assets are considered to be illiquid.

Contractual Obligations

The Fund has entered into certain contracts under which it has future commitments. Payments under the Investment Management Agreement, pursuant to which Siguler Guff Advisers has agreed to serve as the Fund s investment adviser, are equal to a percentage of the net invested capital of the Fund, including assets acquired with borrowed funds, if any.  The Investment Management Agreement will continue in effect until June 8, 2017.  Thereafter, regardless of the dissolution of the Fund, the Investment Management Agreement shall continue automatically for successive periods of a year each June, if not terminated. Either party may terminate the Investment Management Agreement without penalty on least 60 days  written notice to the other party.  The Fund has also entered into a Custodian Agreement, pursuant to which Citibank N.A. has agreed to serve as the Fund s custodian. The Fund pays the custodian such fees as have been agreed between the Fund and the custodian, as described in the Custodian Agreement which the Fund has determined are commercially reasonable in its sole discretion.

Taxation of the Fund as an Ordinary Corporation

During the period ended September 30, 2016, the Fund did not qualify to be treated as a regulated investment company, or RIC, for federal income tax purposes.  As such, the Fund will be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  It is anticipated that, commencing with the second full fiscal year of its investment operations, the Fund will seek to meet the requirements, including diversification, gross income, and distribution requirements, to qualify for the special pass-through status available to RICs under the Code, and thus to be relieved of federal income tax on that part of its net investment income and realized capital gains that it distributes.  Unless and until the Fund meets these requirements, it will be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income for that year even if that income is distributed to the Partnership (its sole direct shareholder), and all distributions out of its earnings and profits will be taxable as dividends to the investors of the Partnership; thus, such income will be subject to two layers of tax (although corporate limited partners may be entitled to a dividends-received deduction).  There is no assurance that the Fund will meet the requirements to qualify as a RIC or be able to maintain such status.

Taxation of the Fund as a RIC

Consequences of Converting From an Ordinary Corporation to a RIC . In order to qualify as a RIC, the Fund must, at the end of the first year in which it so qualifies, have no accumulated earnings and profits from years in which it was not taxed as a RIC. To meet this requirement, the Fund must, before the end of the first year in which it qualifies as a RIC, distribute as dividends all of its accumulated earnings and profits. In addition to the foregoing, pursuant to the Treasury regulations, the Fund must either (i) recognize gain on the disposition of any asset during the subsequent recognition period (generally 10 years) (the  Recognition Period ) beginning on the first day of the first taxable year for which the Fund qualifies for pass-through status as a RIC that is held by the Fund as of the beginning of such Recognition Period, to the extent of the excess of (a) the fair market value of such asset as of the beginning of such Recognition Period over (b) the Fund s adjusted tax basis in such asset as of the beginning of such Recognition Period (such excess, hereinafter,  built-in gain ), taxable at the highest regular corporate rates or (ii) elect to immediately recognize and pay tax on any such built-in gain with respect to any of its portfolio holdings and, as described above, distribute the earnings and profits from such deemed sales. As a RIC, the Fund generally would not be able to use any net operating loss carryforwards relating to periods prior to the first year in which the Fund qualifies as a RIC.

RIC Qualification Requirements . In order to qualify as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, the Fund must, among other things, (1) at all times during the taxable year, have a valid and effective election to be a BDC under Sections 6(f) and 54 of the 1940 Act; (2) derive at least 90% of its gross income for each taxable year from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies, or other income (including gains from options, futures and forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies, and net income derived from an interest in a qualified publicly traded partnership (as defined in Section 851(h) of the Code); (3) diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of each taxable year:  (a) at least 50% of the value of the Fund s total assets is represented by (i) cash and cash items, U.S. government securities, and securities of other RICs, and (ii) other securities (counting each investment in such other securities only if the value of such securities does not exceed 5% of the value of the Fund s total assets and the Fund does not own more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer of such securities), and (b) not more than 25% of the value of the Fund s total assets is invested in (i) the securities (other than U.S. government securities and securities of other RICs) of any one issuer, (ii) the securities (other than securities of other RICs) of two or more issuers that the Fund controls (defined as 20% or more of the voting power) and that are engaged in the same, similar, or related trades or businesses, or (iii) the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships; and (4) file an election to be a RIC.

If the Fund qualifies as a RIC and properly distributes to its shareholders each taxable year an amount equal to or exceeding the sum of (1) 90% of its  investment company taxable income  as that term is defined in the Code (which includes, among other things, dividends, taxable interest, and the excess of any net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses, as reduced by certain deductible expenses) without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and (2) 90% of the excess of its gross tax-exempt interest, if any, over certain disallowed deductions, the Fund generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any income of the fund, including  net capital gain  (the excess of net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss), distributed to the shareholders. However, if the Fund meets such distribution requirements and, thus, is eligible for pass-through status, but chooses to retain some portion of its investment company taxable income or net capital gain, it generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate income tax rates on the amount retained. A distribution of warrants or equity investments to its shareholders will be treated as a sale by the Fund of such assets with the excess of the fair market value of those assets over their tax basis being the amount of the income or gain to the Fund arising from the distribution.

If, after initially qualifying as a RIC, the Fund fails to qualify as a RIC that is eligible for pass-through status for any taxable year, it will be treated as a U.S. corporation subject to U.S. federal income tax, thereby subjecting any income earned by the Fund to tax at the corporate level and to a further tax at the shareholder level when such income is distributed. In such a case, there may be substantial tax and other costs associated with re-qualifying as a RIC.

If the Fund qualifies as a RIC, the Fund will be subject to a nondeductible 4% excise tax ( Excise Tax ) to the extent it fails to distribute by the end of any calendar year at least 98% of its ordinary income for such calendar year and 98.2% of its capital gain net income for the one-year period ending on October 31 of such calendar year, plus certain other undistributed amounts. For these purposes, any taxable income retained by the Fund, and on which it pays federal income tax, will be treated as having been distributed.

The Fund currently intends to distribute in each year for which it qualifies as a RIC substantially all of its net investment income and capital gain net income so as not to be subject to either federal income tax or Excise Tax.

Tax Status  .  The Fund must meet a number of requirements, described above under the caption  Taxation  to qualify for the pass-through status as a RIC and, if qualified, to continue to so qualify. If the Fund experiences difficulty in meeting the diversification requirement for any fiscal quarter of its taxable year, it may accelerate capital calls or, if available, borrowings in order to increase the portion of the Fund s total assets represented by cash, cash items and U.S. government securities as of the close of the following fiscal quarter and thus attempt to meet the diversification requirement. The Fund, however, would incur additional interest and other expenses in connection with any such accelerated borrowings, and increased investments by the Fund in cash, cash items and U.S. government securities (whether the funds to make such investments are derived from called equity capital or from accelerated borrowings) are likely to reduce the Fund s return. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the Fund would be able to meet the diversification requirements through such actions. Failure to qualify as a RIC would deny the Fund pass-through status and, in a year in which the Fund has taxable income, would have a significant adverse effect on the returns of the Fund.

When the Fund elects to convert its status from that of an ordinary, or C, corporation to that of a RIC, it must choose either to (i) pay tax whenever an asset is sold during the subsequent  conversion period  (generally, ten years) following the conversion on the amount of gain which would have been realized had the asset been sold on the conversion date, or (ii) treat the entire amount of  built-in gain  as income at the time of conversion.

Effect of Certain Investments and Investment Practices . The Fund s activities generally may be unlike the typical activities engaged in by most investment companies that seek to qualify as RICs for federal income tax purposes. Certain aspects of these activities may at times make it more difficult for the Fund to satisfy the requirements for qualifying as a RIC than is the case for other investment companies. For example, because the Fund generally will call capital from the Partnership on an  as needed  basis and will have relatively few investments in its early period of operations, the Fund will not be holding substantial amounts of  cash and cash items  that could be counted towards the Fund s RIC diversification requirements. As noted above, it is anticipated that the Fund will not meet the RIC requirements (and in particular the diversification requirement) until the second year of its investment operations, and there is no assurance that the Fund will meet the requirements to qualify as a RIC within that timeframe.

ITEM 3.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES OF MARKET RISK.

The Fund s business activities entail various elements of risk.  The Fund considers the principal types of market risk to be interest rate risk (including risks associated with changing interest rates), credit risk and valuation risk.

Changes in interest rates may affect the cost of funding, interest income earned, and the fair value of portfolio investments. The Investment Manager s risk management processes and procedures for the Fund are designed to identify and analyze risk, to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks and limits by means of administrative and information systems and other policies and programs. The Fund s investment income will be affected by changes in various interest rates, including LIBOR and prime rates, to the extent its debt investments include floating interest rates. In addition, the Fund s investments are carried at fair value as determined in good faith by the Fund s Board of Directors. The Fund s fair valuation methodology in part utilizes discount rates, and changes in those discount rates may have an impact on the fair valuation of Fund investments.

The Fund s sensitivity to changes in interest rates is regularly monitored and analyzed by measuring the characteristics of assets and liabilities. The Fund uses various methods to assess interest rate risk in terms of the potential effect on interest income and fair valuation of Fund investments.  Assuming no changes in investment and capital structure, a hypothetical increase in discount rates of 100 basis points would decrease the Fund s net assets resulting from operations by an estimated $491,000 at September 30, 2016. The Fund had no outstanding borrowings as of the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Should the Fund elect to use leverage, its sensitivity to changes in interest rates and other risks would be substantially greater.

The Fund also intends to manage its risk by maintaining a portfolio that is diverse by industry, size of investment, and borrowers.  The Fund continually monitors the financial condition of its borrowers and reports thereon to the Fund s Board of Directors.  The Fund has limited exposure to public market price fluctuations as the Fund invests in the debt of private business enterprises.  The equity investment accompanying most debt investments (which, if it becomes publicly-traded, is subject to enhanced market risk) is generally made by the Partnership.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

At the end of the period covered by this report, Management carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of its President and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). Based upon that evaluation, the President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Fund s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Fund in such reports was accumulated and communicated to the Fund s management, including its President and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

During the period covered by this report, there were no changes in the Fund s internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Fund s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

The Fund is not currently a party to any legal proceedings.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS.

There have been no material changes from the risk factors discussed in the Fund s 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the second quarter.  The risks described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are not the only risks facing the Fund.  Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Fund or the Investment Manager or that the Fund or the Investment Manager currently believe to be insignificant may materially affect the Fund s business and financial condition in the future.

ITEM 2. 

UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.

Prior to the Fund s commencement of operations on October 13, 2015, the Fund sold 100,000 shares to the Fund s sole shareholder, the Partnership, for $25,000 on September 19, 2014.  No other shares of the Funds have been sold; however, the Fund received paid in capital during the period from October 13, 2015, commencement of operations, through September 30, 2016, which is expected to be used for fund investments and operations.  The Fund may receive additional paid in capital from the Partnership in the future.
