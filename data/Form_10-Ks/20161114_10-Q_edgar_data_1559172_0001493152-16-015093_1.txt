Note
1 - Organization and Basis of Presentation   

History   

On
March 13, 2015 ( closing date ), Diego Pellicer Worldwide, Inc. (f/k/a Type 1 Media, Inc.) (the  Company )
closed on a merger and share exchange agreement (the  Merger Agreement ) by and among (i) the Company, and (ii) Diego
Pellicer World-wide 1, Inc., a Delaware corporation, ( Diego ), and (iii) Jonathan White, the majority shareholder
of the Company (the  Majority Shareholder ). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Diego was merged with
and into the Company, with the Company to continue as the surviving corporation (the  Surviving Corporation ) in the
Merger, and the Company succeeding to and assuming all the rights, assets, liabilities, debts, and obligations of Diego (the  Merger ).  

Prior
to the merger, 62,700,000 shares of Type 1 Media, Inc. were issued and outstanding. The principal owners of the Company agreed
to transfer their 55,000,000 issued and outstanding shares to a third party in consideration for $169,000 and cancellation of
their 55,000,000 shares. The remaining issued and outstanding shares are still available for trading in the marketplace. At the
time of the Merger, Type 1 Media, Inc. had no assets or liabilities. Accordingly, the business conducted by Type 1 prior to the
Merger is not being operated by the combined entity post-Merger.  

At
the closing of the Merger, Diego common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Merger was exchanged
for the right to receive 1 share of the surviving legal entity. An aggregate of 21,632,252 common shares of the surviving entity
were issued to the holders of Diego in exchange for their common shares, representing approximately 74% of the combined entity.  

The
Merger has been accounted for as a reverse merger and recapitalization in which Diego is treated as the accounting acquirer and
Diego Pellicer Worldwide, Inc. (f/k/a Type 1 Media, Inc.) is the surviving legal entity.  

Business
Operations   

The
Company leases real estate to licensed marijuana operators, including but not limited to, providing complete turnkey growing space,
processing space, recreational and medical retail sales space and related facilities to licensed marijuana growers, processors,
dispensary and recreational store operators. Additionally, the Company plans to explore ancillary opportunities in the regulated
marijuana industry as well as offering for wholesale distribution branded non-marijuana clothing and accessories.  

The
Company does not and will not, until such time as Federal law allows, grow, harvest, process, distribute or sell marijuana or
any other substances that violate the laws of the United States of America, or any other country.  

Note
2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

The
Management of the Company is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies and the appropriateness
of accounting policies and their application. Critical accounting policies and practices are those that are both most important
to the portrayal of the Company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult, subjective,
or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.
The Company s significant and critical accounting policies and practices are disclosed below as required by generally accepted
accounting principles.  

Basis
of Presentation   

The
Company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ).  

Principles
of Consolidation   

The
financial statements include the accounts of Diego Pellicer Worldwide, Inc., and its wholly-owned subsidiary Diego Pellicer Worldwide
1, Inc., Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

New
accounting pronouncements   

From
time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard setting bodies
that may have an impact on the Company s accounting and reporting. The Company believes that such recently issued accounting
pronouncements and other authoritative guidance for which the effective date is in the future either will not have an impact on
its accounting or reporting or that such impact will not be material to its financial position, results of operations and cash
flows when implemented.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. These estimates and assumptions include valuing equity securities and derivative financial instruments issued in financing
transactions and share based payment arrangements, determining the fair value of the warrants received for the licensing agreement,
the collectability of accounts receivable and deferred taxes and related valuation allowances.  

Certain
of our estimates, including evaluating the collectability of accounts receivable, could be affected by external conditions, including
those unique to our industry, and general economic conditions. It is possible that these external factors could have an effect
on our estimates that could cause actual results to differ from our estimates. We re-evaluate all of our accounting estimates
at least quarterly based on these conditions and record adjustments when necessary.  

Fair
Value Measurements   

The
Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify
as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument
is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported
in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments
should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities
are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument
could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.  

Fair
value of financial instruments   

As
required by the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC, fair value is measured based on a three-tier fair
value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:  

Level
1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or
liabilities;  

Level
2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially
the full term of the asset or liability; and  

Level
3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable
(supported by little or no market activity).  

Fair
value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as
of and September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments
approximated their fair values. These financial instruments include cash, prepaid expenses and accounts payable. Fair values were
assumed to approximate carrying values for cash and payables because they are short term in nature and their carrying amounts
approximate fair values or they are payable on demand.  

Cash   

The
Company maintains cash balances at various financial institutions. Accounts at each institution are insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, or    the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund up to $250,000. The Company s
accounts at these institutions may, at times, exceed the federal insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in
such accounts.  

Property
and equipment and depreciation policy   

Property
and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided for on a straight-line basis over the
useful lives of the assets. Expenditures for additions and improvements are capitalized; repairs and maintenance are expensed
as incurred.  

The
Company intends to take depreciation or amortization on a straight-line basis for all properties, beginning when they are put
into service, using the following life expectancy:  

Equipment
  5 years  

  Leasehold
Improvements   10 years, or the term of the lease, whichever is shorter  

  Buildings
  20 years  

Property,
leasehold improvements and equipment are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset s
or asset group s carrying value may not be fully recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 144. An impairment loss, calculated
as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of an asset or asset group, is recognized if the sum
of the expected discounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value.  

Inventory   

The
Company s inventory is stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value, with cost primarily determined on a weighted-average
cost basis on the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method.  

Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   

Accounts receivable
are presented at their face amount, less an allowance for doubtful accounts, on the balance sheets. Accounts receivable consist
of revenue earned and currently due from sub lessee. The Company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on
a combination of factors, and will recognize reserves for bad debts based on estimates developed using standard quantitative measures
that incorporate historical write-offs and current economic conditions. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the outstanding
balance allowance for doubtful accounts is $148,466 and $10,080, respectively. 

The
policy for determining past due status is based on the contractual payment terms of each customer. Once collection efforts by
the Company and its collection agency are exhausted, the determination for charging off uncollectible receivables is made.  

Revenue
recognition   

The
Company recognizes revenue from rent, tenant reimbursements, and other revenue sources once all of the following criteria are
met in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 104,  Revenue Recognition,  ( SAB 104 ): (a) the agreement
has been fully executed and delivered; (b) services have been rendered; (c) the amount is fixed or determinable; and (d) the collectability
of the amount is reasonably assured.  

In
accordance with ASC 840 ( Leases ), as amended and interpreted, minimum annual rental revenue is recognized in rental
revenues on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease. Rental revenue recognition commences when the tenant takes
possession or controls the physical use of the leased space. In order for the tenant to take possession, the leased space must
be substantially ready for its intended use. To determine whether the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use,
management evaluates whether the Company or the tenant is the owner of tenant improvements for accounting purposes. When management
concludes that the Company is the owner of tenant improvements, rental revenue recognition begins when the tenant takes possession
of the finished space, which is when such tenant improvements are substantially complete. In certain instances, when management
concludes that the Company is not the owner (the tenant is the owner) of tenant improvements, rental revenue recognition begins
when the tenant takes possession of or controls the space.  

When
management concludes that the Company is the owner of tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, management records the cost
to construct the tenant improvements as a capital asset. In addition, management records the cost of certain tenant improvements
paid for or reimbursed by tenants as capital assets when management concludes that the Company is the owner of such tenant improvements.
For these tenant improvements, management records the amount funded or reimbursed by tenants as deferred revenue, which is amortized
as additional rental income over the term of the related lease. When management concludes that the tenant is the owner of tenant
improvements for accounting purposes, management records the Company s contribution towards those improvements as a lease
incentive, which is amortized as a reduction to rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  

In
January 2014, the Company entered into an agreement to license certain intellectual property to a third party. In consideration,
the Company received warrants to purchase shares of common stock, which were valued based on an appraisal of the warrants by an
independent third party appraiser. The revenue from the licensing agreement, which is initially recorded as deferred revenue,
is being amortized over the ten year term of the licensing agreement.  

The
Company records rents due from the tenants on a current basis. However, as part of the Line of Credit Agreement, the Company has
deferred collection of such rents until the tenants receive the proper governmental licenses to begin operation. It is anticipated
that such licenses should be obtained prior to the end of 2016. Management has decided to take the approach and reserve these
amounts due to the contingency factor and experience with typical delays in governmental action.  

Leases
as Lessor   

The
Company currently leases properties in locations that would be acceptable for regulatory purposes and acceptable to sub-lessees
for the manufacturing and development of their products. The Company evaluates the lease to determine its appropriate classification
as an operating or capital lease for financial reporting purposes. The Company currently has a number of leases, which are all
classified as operating leases.  

Minimum
base rent for the Company s operating leases, which generally have escalating rentals over the term of the lease, is recorded
on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The initial rent term includes the build-out, or may include a short rent holiday
period, for the Company s leases, where no rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease.  

Leases   

For
lease agreements that provide for escalating rent payments or free-rent occupancy periods, the Company recognizes rent expense
on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable lease term and option renewal periods where failure to exercise such options
would result in an economic penalty in such amount that renewal appears, at the inception of the lease, to be reasonably assured.
The lease term commences on the date that the Company takes possession of or controls the physical use of the property. Deferred
rent is presented on current liabilities section on the consolidated balance sheets.  

Income
Taxes   

Income
taxes are provided for using the liability method of accounting in accordance with the Income Taxes Topic of the FASB ASC. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities
and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation
allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized and when, in the opinion
of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The computation
of limitations relating to the amount of such tax assets, and the determination of appropriate valuation allowances relating to
the realizing of such assets, are inherently complex and require the exercise of judgment. As additional information becomes available,
the Company continually assesses the carrying value of their net deferred tax assets.  

Research
and Development Costs   

Research
and development costs are charged to the statement of operations as incurred.  

Preferred
Stock   

The
Company applies the guidance enumerated in ASC 480  Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity  when determining the classification
and measurement of preferred stock. Preferred shares subject to mandatory redemption (if any) are classified as liability instruments
and are measured at fair value. It classifies conditionally redeemable preferred shares (if any), which includes preferred shares
that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of
uncertain events not solely within our control, as temporary equity. At all other times, it classifies its preferred shares in
stockholders  equity. Preferred shares do not feature any redemption rights within the holders  control or conditional
redemption features not within our control. Accordingly all issuances of preferred stock are presented as a component of consolidated
stockholders  equity (deficit).  

Common
Stock Purchase Warrants and Other Derivative Financial Instruments   

We
classify as equity any contracts that require physical settlement or net-share settlement or provide us a choice of net-cash settlement
or settlement in our own shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement) provided that such contracts are indexed to our
own stock as defined in ASC 815-40 ( Contracts in Entity s Own Equity ). We classify as assets or liabilities
any contracts that require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net cash settle the contract if an event occurs and
if that event is outside our control) or give the counterparty a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical
settlement or net-share settlement). We assess classification of our common stock purchase warrants and other free standing derivatives
at each reporting date to determine whether a change in classification between assets and liabilities is required.  

Stock-Based
Compensation   

The
Company recognizes compensation expense for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718. For employee stock-based
awards, it calculates the fair value of the award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes method for stock options and the
quoted price of our common stock for unrestricted shares; the expense is recognized over the service period for awards expected
to vest. For non-employee stock-based awards, it calculates the fair value of the award on the date of grant in the same manner
as employee awards, however, the awards are revalued at the end of each reporting period and the pro rata compensation expense
is adjusted accordingly until such time the nonemployee award is fully vested, at which time the total compensation recognized
to date equals the fair value of the stock-based award as calculated on the measurement date, which is the date at which the award
recipient s performance is complete. The estimation of stock-based awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and
to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from original estimates, such amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment
in the period estimates are revised. The Company considers many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types
of awards, employee class, and historical experience.  

Loss
per common share   

Net
loss per share is provided in accordance with ASC Subtopic 260-10. We present basic loss per share ( EPS ) and diluted
EPS on the face of statements of operations. Basic EPS is computed by dividing reported losses by the weighted average shares
outstanding. Loss per common share has been computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the

Note
3 - Going Concern   

The accompanying financial statements have
been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred losses since inception, its
current liabilities exceed its current assets by $3,912,229 and has a stockholders  deficiency of $3,281,442 at September
30, 2016. These factors, among others raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Management
believes that the Company s future success is dependent upon its ability to achieve profitable operations, generate cash
from operating activities and obtain additional financing. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to generate sufficient
cash from operations, sell additional shares of stock or borrow additional funds from its stockholders. The Company s inability
to obtain additional cash could have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, and its ability
to continue in existence. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty.  

The
Company intends to continue to raise additional capital to be used for ongoing preopening expenses. Once the tenants commence
operations and generate profits, rental revenues should exceed rental expense for the four properties.  

Note
4 - Investment

an Agreement with Plandai Biotechnology, Inc. (a publicly traded company) to license to them certain intellectual property rights
in exchange for warrants to purchase 1,666,667 shares of Plandai Biotechnology, Inc. ( Plandai ) common stock. This
license agreement carries a 10-year term with an exercise price of $0.01 per share. The Company is to obtain certain Trademark
rights certified by the government (expected by the end of 2016). On October 10, 2014 the Company filed its Notice of Exercise
to execute the warrants to acquire the shares of Plandai, in which the shares have not yet been issued. The sale of such shares
has a  leak out  restriction on them requiring that the sale of such shares must reach a certain traded price of $0.50
per share. The Company used a third party appraisal firm to ascertain the fair value of warrants held by the company, which was
determined to be $525,567. With the Plandai shares trading at $.07 per share, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $408,900
during the year ended December 31, 2015. During nine months ended September 30, 2016, The company recorded an impairment loss

The
table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for the liabilities measured using fair significant
unobservable inputs (Level 3):  

The
fair value of embedded conversion feature of convertible note determined using a Black Scholes Simulation. This model requires
the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected price volatility, which is based on the historical volatility
of a peer group of publicly traded companies. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the estimate of
fair value of the warrants and the Company s results of operations could be impacted.

 Company ,  we ,  us  or  our ) should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements of Diego Pellicer Worldwide, Inc. and the notes to those financial statements that are included elsewhere in this Form

Overview   

Diego Pellicer Worldwide, Inc. was established
on August 26, 2013 to provide commercial support services, retail and grow facilities, and accessories to the market created by
the legislation allowing for the legalization of cannabis operations for recreational use in several states. These markets currently
include Colorado, Washington and with a number of other states giving consideration to this market as well. It is expected that
the industry will operate under stringent regulations within the various state jurisdictions. 

The company s primary business plan
is to lease various properties to licensed operators to grow, process and retail cannabis and related products. By developing
a premium brand name, building upscale facilities, and providing quality accessories to a market where financing is difficult
to obtain, these subleases leases are designed to provide a substantial stream of income. We believe that as laws evolve, it is
possible that we will have the opportunity to participate directly in these operations as well.

Date ), pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act.  

Based
on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date,
our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, due to material weaknesses
in our control environment and financial reporting process.  

Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls   

Our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our Disclosure Controls
and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to
their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include
the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake.
Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management
or board override of the control.  

The
design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there
can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time,
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.  

Because
of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 that materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
