(Unaudited)

NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS  
     We develop and sell devices
that use spintronics, a nanotechnology that relies on electron spin rather than
electron charge to acquire, store, and transmit information. 
 
   NOTE 2.
INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION  
     The accompanying unaudited financial statements
of NVE Corporation are prepared consistent with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States and in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission
rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, these financial statements
reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal and recurring adjustments,
necessary for a fair presentation of the financial statements. Although we believe
that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading,
it is suggested that these unaudited financial statements be read in conjunction
with the audited financial statements and the notes included in our latest annual
financial statements included in our Annual Report on  Form
10-K  for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. The results of operations
for the quarter or six months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the full fiscal year ending
March 31, 2017. 
 
    NOTE 3.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  
     In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash
Receipts and Cash Payments , which will make eight targeted changes to how
cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement
of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, which will
be fiscal 2019 for us. ASU 2016-15 requires retrospective adoption unless it is
impracticable to apply, in which case it is to be applied prospectively as of
the earliest practicable date. We do not expect adoption of ASU 2016-15 to
have a significant impact on our financial statements. 
 
     In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial
Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Statements . This ASU requires a financial asset (or a group of financial assets)
measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to
be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted
from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying
value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The amendment
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, which
will be fiscal 2021 for us. We do not expect adoption of ASU 2016-13 to have
a significant impact on our financial statements. 
 
     Information regarding all other applicable recently
issued accounting standards, on which our position have not changed since our
latest annual financial statements, are contained in the financial statements
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016. 
 
   NOTE 4.
NET INCOME PER SHARE  
     Net income per basic share is computed based on
the weighted-average number of common shares issued and outstanding during each
period. Net income per diluted share amounts assume exercise of all stock options.
Stock options totaling 6,000 for the quarter
and 14,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 4,000 for the
quarter and six months ended September 30, 2015 were not included in the
computation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise prices were greater
than the market price of the common stock. 
      The following tables show the components of diluted
shares:

NOTE 5. MARKETABLE SECURITIES 
 
     Marketable securities with remaining maturities
less than one year are classified as short-term, and those with remaining maturities
greater than one year are classified as long-term. The fair value of our marketable
securities as of September 30, 2016, by maturity, were as follows: 

As of September 30 and March 31, 2016,
our marketable securities were as follows: 

Five securities were in an unrealized loss position
as of September 30, 2016. The following table shows the gross unrealized
losses and fair value of our investments with unrealized losses, aggregated by
investment category and length of time that individual securities had been in
a continuous unrealized loss position as of September 30 and March 31,
2016: 

Because we expect to recover the cost basis of investments
held, we do not consider any of our marketable securities to be impaired as of
September 30, 2016.

NOTE 6. INVENTORIES 
 
     Inventories consisted of the following: 

NOTE 7.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  
      Stock-based compensation expense was $22,000
for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2017, and $21,160 for the
second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2016. Stock-based compensation expenses
for the quarters and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were due
to the issuance of automatic stock options to our non-employee directors on their
reelection to our Board. We calculate the share-based compensation expense using
the Black-Scholes standard option-pricing model. 
   
  NOTE 8. INCOME TAXES  
     Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects
of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities
for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

We had no unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30,
2016, and we do not expect any significant unrecognized tax benefits within 12 months
of the reporting date. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax
matters in income tax expense. As of September 30, 2016 we had no accrued
interest related to uncertain tax positions. The tax years 1999 and 2013 through
2015 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which we
are subject. 

NOTE 9. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  
     Generally accepted accounting principles establish
a framework for measuring fair value, provide a definition of fair value and prescribe
required disclosures about fair-value measurements. Generally accepted accounting
principles define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset
or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement that
should be determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing
an asset or liability. Generally accepted accounting principles utilize a valuation
hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. The categorization within
the valuation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant
to the fair value measurement. The categories within the valuation hierarchy are
described as follows: 
 
     Level 1   Financial instruments with quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Our Level 1
financial instruments consist of publicly-traded marketable corporate debt
securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. On the balance sheets,
these securities are included in  Marketable securities, short term 
and  Marketable securities, long term.  The fair value of our Level 1
marketable securities was $81,772,564 as of September 30, 2016 and
$84,045,869 as of March 31, 2016. 
 
     Level 2   Financial instruments with quoted
prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities. Level 2 fair
value measurements are determined using either prices for similar instruments
or inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable, such as interest
rates. We had one Level 2 financial instrument, a municipal debt security,
which is classified as available-for-sale. The fair value of the Level 2
marketable security was $1,324,301 as of September 30, 2016 and $1,346,850
as of March 31, 2016. The security was included in  Marketable securities,
short term  on the September 30, 2016 balance sheet, and  Marketable
securities, long term  on the March 31, 2016 balance sheet. 
 
     Level 3   Inputs to the fair value measurement
are unobservable inputs or valuation techniques. We do not have any financial
assets or liabilities being measured at fair value that are classified as Level 3
financial instruments.

NOTE 10. STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM  
     On January 21, 2009 we announced that our Board
of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2,500,000 of our Common Stock,
and on August 27, 2015 we announced that our Board authorized $5,000,000
of additional repurchases. We did not repurchase any of our Common Stock under
the program during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. The remaining authorization
was $4,540,806 as of September 30, 2016. The Repurchase Program may be modified
or discontinued at any time without notice. 
 
 NOTE 11. DIVIDENDS  
     On October 19, 2016 we announced that our Board
had declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.00 per share of Common Stock to be
paid November 30, 2016 to shareholders of record as of the close of business
October 31, 2016. 

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
Forward-looking statements  
     Some of the statements made in this Report or in
the documents incorporated by reference in this Report and in other materials
filed or to be filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC )
as well as information included in verbal or written statements made by us constitute
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to the safe harbor provisions
of the reform act. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of
the terminology such as may, will, expect, anticipate, intend, believe, estimate,
should, or continue, or the negatives of these terms or other variations on these
words or comparable terminology. To the extent that this Report contains forward-looking
statements regarding the financial condition, operating results, business prospects
or any other aspect of NVE, you should be aware that our actual financial condition,
operating results and business performance may differ materially from that projected
or estimated by us in the forward-looking statements. We have attempted to identify,
in context, some of the factors that we currently believe may cause actual future
experience and results to differ from their current expectations. These differences
may be caused by a variety of factors, including but not limited to our reliance
on several large customers for a significant percentage of revenue, uncertainties
related to the economic environments in the industries we serve, uncertainties
related to future contract research and development revenue, uncertainties related
to future stock repurchases and dividend payments, and other specific risks that
may be alluded to in this Report or in the documents incorporated by reference
in this Report. 
 
     Further information regarding our risks and uncertainties
are contained in Part I, Item 1A  Risk Factors  of our Annual Report
on  Form 10-K  for the year ended March 31,
2016. 
 
 General  
     NVE Corporation, referred to as NVE, we, us, or
our, develops and sells devices that use spintronics, a nanotechnology that relies
on electron spin rather than electron charge to acquire, store and transmit information.
We manufacture high-performance spintronic products including sensors and couplers
that are used to acquire and transmit data. We have also licensed our spintronic
magnetoresistive random access memory technology, commonly known as MRAM. 
 
 Critical accounting policies  
     A description of our critical accounting policies
is provided in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on  Form
10-K  for the year ended March 31, 2016. As of September 30, 2016
our critical accounting policies and estimates continued to include investment
valuation, inventory valuation, and deferred tax assets estimation.

Table
of Contents  
 
Quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to quarter ended September 30,
2015  
     The table shown below summarizes the percentage
of revenue and quarter-to-quarter changes for various items: 

Total revenue for the quarter ended September 30,
2016 (the second quarter of fiscal 2017) increased 0.3% compared to the quarter
ended September 30, 2015 (the second quarter of fiscal 2016). The increase
was due to a 6% increase in product sales, partially offset by a 42% decrease
in contract research and development revenue. 
 
     The increase in product sales from the prior-year
quarter was due to new customers. The decrease in contract research and development
revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was due to the completion of certain
contracts. 
 
     Gross profit margin decreased to 76% of revenue
for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to 77% for the second quarter of
fiscal 2016, due to decreased gross profit margins on product sales with a less
profitable product sales mix. 
 
     Total expenses decreased 4% for the second quarter
of fiscal 2017 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016, due to a 34% decrease
in selling, general, and administrative expense, partially offset by an 22% increase
in research and development expense. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative
expense was primarily due to decreased sales commissions. The increase in research
and development expense was due to an increase in new product development activities. 
 
     Interest income for the second quarter of fiscal
2017 decreased 8% due to a decrease in the average interest rates on our marketable
securities.  
 
     The provision for income taxes was $1,575,635 for
the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $1,639,386 for the second quarter
of fiscal 2016. The effective tax rate was 32% of income before taxes for the
second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to 33% for the second quarter of fiscal
2016. 
 
     The 0.2% decrease in net income in the second quarter
of fiscal 2017 compared to the prior-year quarter was primarily due to decreases
in contract research and development revenue, gross profit margin, and interest
income, partially offset by increased product sales, decreased total expenses,
and a decrease in the provision for income taxes.

Table
of Contents  
 
Six months ended September 30, 2016 compared to six months ended September 30,
2015  
     The table shown below summarizes the percentage
of revenue and period-to-period changes for various items: 

Total revenue for the six months ended September 30,
2016 decreased 10% compared to the six months ended September 30, 2015. The
decrease was due to an 11% decrease in product sales and a 6% decrease in contract
research and development revenue. 
 
     The decrease in product sales from the prior-year
period was due to decreased purchase volume by existing customers. The decrease
in contract research and development revenue for the first six months of fiscal
2017 was due to the completion of certain contracts. 
 
     Gross profit margin increased to 78% of revenue
for the first six months of fiscal 2017 compared to 77% for the first six months
of fiscal 2016, due to increased gross profit margins on contact research and
development revenue. 
 
     Total expenses decreased 3% for the first six months
of fiscal 2017 compared to the first six months of fiscal 2016, due to a 27% decrease
in selling, general, and administrative expense, partially offset by an 17% increase
in research and development expense. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative
expense was primarily due to decreases in sales commissions. The increase in research
and development expense was due to an increase in new product development activities. 
 
     Interest income for the first six months of fiscal
2017 decreased 9% due to a decrease in marketable securities and a decrease in
the average interest rates on those securities. 
 
     The 10% decrease in net income in the first six
months of fiscal 2017 compared to the prior-year quarter was primarily due to
decreased total revenue and decreased interest income.

 Liquidity and capital resources  
 
  Overview   
     Cash and cash equivalents were $5,690,673 as of
September 30, 2016 compared to $7,534,593 as of March 31, 2016.
The $1,843,920 decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the six months ended
September 30, 2016 was due to $9,628,940 net cash used in financing activities,
partially offset by $5,666,144 in net cash provided by operating activities and
$2,118,876 net cash provided by investing activities. We currently believe our
working capital and cash generated from operations will be adequate for our needs
at least for the next 12 months. 
 
  Operating Activities   
     Accounts receivable as of September 30, 2016
increased $1,124,084 compared to March 31, 2016, primarily due to the
timing of sales to and payments from certain customers. 
 
  Investing Activities   
     Net cash provided by investing activities in the
first six months of fiscal 2017 was primarily due to marketable security maturities
of $9,200,000, less marketable security purchases of $6,928,028. 
  
  Financing Activities   
     Net cash used in financing activities in the first
six months of fiscal 2017 was primarily due to $9,670,020 of cash dividends paid to
shareholders. In addition to dividends paid in the first six months of fiscal
2017, on October 19, 2016 we announced that our Board had declared a cash
quarterly dividend of an additional $1.00 per share of common stock, or $4,836,010
based on shares outstanding as of October 14, 2016, to be paid November 30,
2016. We plan to fund such dividends through cash provided by operating activities
and proceeds from maturities of marketable securities. All future dividends will
be subject to Board approval and subject to the company s results of operations,
cash and marketable security balances, estimates of future cash requirements,
and other factors the Board may deem relevant. Furthermore, dividends may be modified
or discontinued at any time without notice. 
  
   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk.  
     As discussed in our Annual Report on  Form
10-K  for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, we are exposed to financial
market risks, primarily marketable securities and, to a lesser extent, changes
in currency exchange rates. 
  
 Marketable Securities  
     The primary objective of our investment activities
is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing after-tax yields without
significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio
of cash equivalents and marketable securities in securities including municipal
obligations, corporate obligations, and money market funds. Short-term and long-term
marketable securities are generally classified as available-for-sale and consequently
are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses
reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income or
loss, net of estimated tax. Our marketable securities as of September 30,
2016 had remaining maturities between 17 days and 231 weeks. Marketable
securities had a market value of $83,096,865 as of September 30, 2016, representing
approximately 85% of our total assets. We have not used derivative financial instruments
in our investment portfolio.

 Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
     Management, with the participation of the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has performed an evaluation of
our disclosure controls and procedures that are defined in  Rules
13a-15(e)  and  15d-15(e)  of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) as of the end of
the period covered by this Report. This evaluation included consideration of the
controls, processes, and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective. 
 
  Changes in Internal Controls   
     During the quarter ended September 30, 2016,
there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.
