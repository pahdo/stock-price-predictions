NOTE 1  
DESCRIPTION OF OUR COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (In thousands, except per share amounts)  

Description of our Company  

ITEX Corporation ( ITEX ,  Company ,
 we  or  us ) was incorporated in October 1985 in the State of Nevada. Through our independent licensed
broker and franchise network (individually,  broker,  and together the  Broker Network ) in the United
States and Canada, we operate a  Marketplace  in which products and services are exchanged by Marketplace members utilizing
 ITEX dollars . ITEX dollars are only usable in the Marketplace and allows thousands of member businesses (our  members )
to acquire products and services without exchanging cash. We administer the Marketplace and provide record-keeping and payment
transaction processing services for our members. 

Unaudited Interim Financial Information  

We have prepared the accompanying consolidated
financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) for
interim financial reporting. These consolidated financial statements are unaudited and, in our opinion, include all adjustments,
consisting of normal recurring adjustments and accruals necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated balance sheets, operating
results, and cash flows for the periods presented. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) have
been omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and
the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses
during the reporting period. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes in Item 8 of Part II,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,  of
our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 19, 2016. 

Principles of Consolidation  

The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of ITEX Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary BXI Exchange, Inc. All inter-company accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Use of Estimates  

Management has made a number of estimates
and assumptions relating to the reporting of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities to prepare these consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

5   

Income Per Share  

We prepare our financial statements using
both basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share excludes potential dilution and is computed by dividing income
available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per
share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or
converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity. As of October
31, 2016, we had no contracts to issue common stock. The Company had 114 unvested restricted stock units that were dilutive as
of October 31, 2016. 

The following table presents a reconciliation
of the denominators used in the computation of net income per common share basic and net income per common share   diluted
for the three-month period ended October 31, 2016 (in thousands, except per share data) (unaudited): 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09) , which amends the existing
accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects
to be entitled when products or services are transferred to customers. In July 2015, the FASB voted to approve a one-year delay
of the effective date. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including
interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2016, including interim reporting periods within those annual periods. ASU 2014-09 may be applied retrospectively to each prior
period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. In 2016, the FASB issued
additional guidance to clarify the implementation guidance. The Company is evaluating the expected impact on its consolidated financial
statements. 

In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update (ASU) 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , intended to improve how deferred taxes are
classified on organizations  balance sheets. The ASU eliminates the current requirement for organizations to present deferred
tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead, organizations will now be required
to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The pronouncement is effective for reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual period. The adoption of ASU 2015-17
is not expected to have any material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

6   

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which amends the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and creates Topic 842,   Leases .  
The new topic supersedes Topic 840,   Leases ,  and increases transparency and comparability among organizations
by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requires disclosures of key information about leasing
arrangements.  The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  ASU 2016-02 mandates
a modified retrospective transition method.  The Company is currently assessing the impact this guidance will have on its
consolidated financial statements.  Adoption is not expected to have a significant effect on the Company s financial
statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB amended the existing
accounting standards for stock-based compensation, with Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09,  Compensation-Stock Compensation
(Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (ASU 2016-09) . The amendments impact several aspects of
accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, forfeitures, classification of awards as
either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. If early adoption is elected, all amendments must be adopted in the
same period. The manner of application varies by the various provisions of the guidance, with certain provisions applied on a retrospective
or modified retrospective approach, while others are applied prospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of these
amendments and the transition alternatives on its consolidated financial statements, although adoption is not expected to have
a significant effect on the Company s financial statements. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on
Financial Instruments (ASU 2016-13) , an ASU amending the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments.
The ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted after December 15,
2018. The ASU must be adopted using a modified-retrospective approach. The Company does not expect adoption to have a material
impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

NOTE 2  
COMMITMENTS   

The Company leases
office space under operating leases. Lease commitments include a lease for the Company s corporate headquarters in Bellevue,
Washington. In July 2016, we signed a 5-year lease for a new location in Bellevue, Washington, with a lease commencement date of
September 15, 2016. The Company recognizes rent expense under the agreement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The lease
incentive that was part of this lease is reflected as other liabilities   rent expense and amortized as a reduction of rent
expense over the lease term. The lease expiration date is March 31, 2022. 

The lease expense for our executive office
space for the three-months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 was $33 and $21, respectively. 

7   

NOTE 3  
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND LITIGATION CONTINGENCIES  

From time to time we are subject to a variety
of claims and litigation incurred in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, the outcome of our pending legal proceedings,
individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations, cash
flows or financial condition. 

Management has regular litigation reviews,
including updates from outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of contingencies relating to
pending lawsuits. The Company accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable,
and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The Company does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has
been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably
possible or remote. For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant, the Company
discloses the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes of our litigation contingency
disclosures,  significant  includes material matters as well as other items which management believes should be disclosed. 

Management judgment is required related
to contingent liabilities and the outcome of litigation because both are difficult to predict. Litigation is subject to inherent
uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur. Although management currently does not believe resolving any pending proceeding
will have a material adverse impact on our financial statements, management s view of these matters may change in the future.
A material adverse impact on our financial statements could occur in the future if the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes
probable and reasonably estimable. 

NOTE 4  
INCOME TAXES  

Income tax expense during interim periods
is based on applying an estimated annual effective income tax rate to year-to-date income, plus any significant unusual or infrequently
occurring items which are recorded in the interim period.  

The effective tax rate related to our provision
for income taxes in the three-months ended October 31, 2016 is similar to that used in the period ended October 31, 2015. 

The computation of the annual estimated
effective tax rate at each interim period requires certain estimates and significant judgment including, but not limited to, the
expected operating income for the year, projections of the proportion of income earned and taxed in various jurisdictions, permanent
and temporary differences, and the likelihood of recovering deferred tax assets generated in the current year. The accounting
estimates used to compute the provision for income taxes may change as new events occur, more experience is obtained, additional
information becomes known or as the tax environment changes. 

As of October 31, 2016 we have recognized
a net income tax expense of $85 which is our estimated federal and state income tax liability for the three-months ended October 31,
2016. Realization of our deferred tax asset is dependent upon future earnings in specific tax jurisdictions, the timing and amount
of which are uncertain.  As of October 31, 2016 the net deferred tax asset was $2,553. 

We account for any uncertainty in income
taxes by recognizing the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will
be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. We measure the tax benefits
recognized in the financial statements from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood
of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The application of income tax law is inherently complex. As such, we are required to
make subjective assumptions and judgments regarding income tax exposures. The result of the assessment of our tax positions did
not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 5  
STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY (in thousands, except per share amounts)  

The Company has
5,000 shares of preferred stock authorized at $0.01 par value. No preferred shares were issued or outstanding as of October 31,
2016. 

On March 9, 2010, the
Company announced a $2,000 stock repurchase program. The program authorizes the repurchase of shares in open market purchases or
privately negotiated transactions, has no expiration date and may be modified or discontinued by the Board of Directors at any
time. During the three-month period ended October 31, 2016, the Company repurchased 2 shares of common stock for $7. There was
1 share of common stock for $3 purchased during the three-month period ended October 31, 2015. 

On August 16, 2016, the Board of Directors
of ITEX Corporation declared a semi-annual cash dividend in the amount of $0.10 per share, payable on December 12, 2016 to stockholders
of record as of the close of business on December 1, 2016. 

NOTE 6  
STOCK-BASED PAYMENTS (in thousands)  

We account for stock-based compensation
in accordance with the related guidance. Under the fair value recognition provisions, we estimate stock-based compensation cost
at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. We recognize that expense ratably over the requisite service period of
the award and recognized $18 and $59 of stock based compensation expense for the periods ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

At October 31, 2016, 114
shares of common stock granted under the 2004 Plan remained unvested and none under the 2015 plan. At October 31, 2016, the Company
had $415 of unrecognized compensation expense, expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately six years. 

NOTE 7  
SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  

The
Company has evaluated the period after the balance sheet date up through December 9, 2016 and determined that there were no
subsequent events or transactions that required recognition or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (in thousands, except per share amounts) 

In addition to current and historical information,
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to our future operations, prospects,
potential products, services, developments, business strategies or our future financial performance. Forward-looking statements
reflect our expectations and assumptions only as of the date of this report and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual
events or results may differ materially. We have included a detailed discussion of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results and events to differ materially from our forward-looking statements in the section titled  Risk Factors 
in Item 1A of our Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on October 19, 2016. We undertake
no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statement after the date of this report, whether as a result of
new information, future events or otherwise. 

Overview  

ITEX operates a marketplace (the  Marketplace )
in which products and services are exchanged by Marketplace members utilizing ITEX dollars. ITEX dollars are only usable in the
Marketplace and allow thousands of member businesses (our  members ) to acquire products and services without exchanging
cash. We service our member businesses through our independent licensed brokers and franchise network (individually,  broker 
and together, the  Broker Network ) in the United States and Canada. We administer the Marketplace and provide record-keeping
and payment transaction processing services for our members. We generate revenue by charging members percentage-based transaction
fees, association fees, and other fees assessed in United States dollars and Canadian dollars where applicable (collectively and
as reported on our financial statements,  USD  or  Cash ). 

For each calendar year, we divide our operations
into 13 four-week billing and commission cycles always ending on a Thursday ( operating cycle ). For financial statement
purposes, our fiscal year is from August 1 to July 31 ( year ,  2017  for August 1, 2016 to July 31, 2017,
 2016  for August 1, 2015 to July 31, 2016). Our first quarter is the three-month period from August 1, 2016 to October
31, 2016 ( three-month period ended October 31 ). We report our results as of the last day of each calendar month ( accounting
cycle ). The timing of billing and collection activities after the end of the billing cycle does not correspond with the
end of the accounting period, therefore this timing difference results in the fluctuations of the balances of cash, accounts receivable,
commissions payable and accrued commissions on the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows. 

Each operating cycle we generally charge
our members association fees of $20 USD ($260 USD annually) and $10 ITEX dollars ($130 ITEX dollars annually). We also charge transaction
fees in USD from both the buyer and seller computed as a percentage of the ITEX dollar value of the transaction. 

The following summarizes our operational
and financial highlights for the quarter and our outlook (in thousands except per share data): 

10   

Revenue Trends  . Our reduction in revenue this quarter was due to a reduction in members and a corresponding reduction
in transaction and association fees generated from our members. Based on reported revenues and informal market information available
to us, trade exchanges overall are faced with a general decline in year-over-year revenue. We believe this reflects, in part, the
effect of enhanced competition. Trade exchanges currently compete with a wide variety of online and offline companies providing
products and services to consumers and merchants, including big box stores. There are numerous avenues to move excess inventory
or products and services.. We have approximately 33% recurring revenues from association fees. Approximately two-thirds of our
revenues each year come from transactions fees assessed during that year. We believe the expansion of our membership base will
increase our recurring revenues. We continue to seek to increase our revenue by:   

o   enhancing our internet applications;   

o   offering expanded tools and features with ITEX Mobile SM ;   

o   marketing the benefits of participation in the Marketplace;   

o   expanding Marketplace offerings of goods and services;   

o   adding and retaining qualified brokers.   

In order to add new brokers we are sustaining our
broker recruiting incentives. Through our Broker Mentor program, existing brokers recruit prospective brokers and provide ongoing
training to the prospective broker until certain performance thresholds are met. Upon meeting the performance thresholds, the prospective
broker is offered a franchise for a reduced fee.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

Condensed Results (in thousands, except per share data):   

Revenue for the three-months ended October
31, 2016, as compared to the corresponding three-months ended October 31, 2015, decreased by $250, or 9%. The decrease in revenues
during the three-months ended October 31, 2016 was from a reduction in members and a reduction in transaction and association fees
generated from our members. 

Cost of Marketplace revenue consists of
commissions paid to brokers, payment of processing fees and other expenses directly correlated to Marketplace revenue, decreased
by $173, or 10% for the three-month period ended October 31, 2016, as compared to the corresponding three-months ended October
31, 2015. 

Operating expenses which include corporate
salaries, wages and employee benefits, selling, general and administrative, depreciation and amortization decreased by $70, or
8% for the three-months ended October 31, 2016, compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2016. 

Income from operations for the three-months
ended October 31, 2016, as compared to the corresponding three-months ended October 31, 2015, decreased by $7 or 3%. This net decrease
is primarily the result of the $77 decrease in gross profit offset by the $70 decrease in operating expenses for the period ended
October 31, 2016. 

Net income for the three-months ended October
31, 2016, as compared to the corresponding three-months ended October 31, 2015, decreased by $19, or 12%. 

Earnings per share, both basic and diluted,
decreased by $0.01 to $0.07 per share in the three-months ended October 31, 2016 compared to the three-months ended October 31,
2015.

Revenue, Costs and Expenses  

The following table sets forth our selected
consolidated financial information for the three-months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 with amounts expressed as a percentage
of total revenues (in thousands) (unaudited): 

Marketplace revenue  

Marketplace revenue consists of transaction
fees, association fees and other revenues net. Revenue also includes a nominal amount of ITEX dollars (non-cash). The following
are the components of Marketplace revenue that are included in the consolidated statements of income (in thousands) (unaudited): 

Marketplace revenue for the three-months
ended October 31, 2016 decreased by $250, or 9% to $2,564 as compared to $2,814 for the three-months ended October 31, 2015. 

Transaction fees for the three-months ended
October 31, 2016 decreased by $180, or 10%, to $1,582 from $1,762 for the three-months ended October 31, 2015. The decrease in
transaction fees was due to lower transaction volume for the three-months ended October 31, 2016, as compared to the three-months
ended October 31, 2015. 

13   

Association fees for the three-months ended
October 31, 2016 decreased by $63, or 6%, to $909 from $972 for the three-months ended October 31, 2015. The decrease in association
fees is due to a decrease in net active membership accounts for the comparable periods. 

Other revenue for the three-months ended
October 31, 2016 decreased by $7, or 9% to $73 as compared to $80 for the three-months ended October 31, 2015. 

ITEX Dollar Revenue  

As described in the notes to our consolidated
financial statements, we receive ITEX dollars from members  transaction and association fees, and, to a lesser extent, from
other member fees. ITEX dollars earned from members are later used by us in revenue sharing and incentive arrangements with our
Broker Network, including co-op advertising for members, as well as for certain general corporate expenses. ITEX dollars are only
usable in our Marketplace. 

Occasionally we spend ITEX dollars in the
Marketplace for our corporate needs. As discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in our most recent form
10-K filed with the SEC on October 19, 2016, we record ITEX dollar revenue in the amounts ultimately equal to expenses we incurred
and paid for in ITEX dollars, resulting in an overall net effect of $0 on the operating and net income lines. We recorded $21 and
$23 as ITEX dollar revenue for the three-months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

The corresponding ITEX dollar expenses in
the period ended October 31, 2016 was for equipment, legal services, printing, outside services and miscellaneous expenses. We
plan to continue to utilize ITEX dollars for our corporate purposes in future periods. 

Cost of Marketplace Revenue  

Cost of Marketplace revenue consists of
commissions paid to brokers, payment of processing fees and other expenses directly correlated to Marketplace revenue. The following
are the main components of cost of Marketplace revenue that are included in the consolidated statements of income (in thousands)(unaudited): 

Cost of Marketplace revenue for the three-months
ended October 31, 2016 was $1,568 as compared to $1,741 for the three-months ended October 31, 2015, a decrease of $173, or 10%. 

14   

Transaction fee commissions for the three-months
ended October 31, 2016 decreased by $130 or 10% to $1,186 as compared to $1,316 for the three-months ended October 31, 2015. The
decrease in transaction fee commissions is due to the reduction in transaction fee revenue which is similar to the 10% reduction
is transaction fee revenues for the comparable period. 

Association fee commissions for the three-months
ended October 31, 2016 decreased by $22, or 6% to $326 as compared to $348 for the three-months ended October 31, 2015. The decrease
in association fee commissions is due to a similar reduction in association fee revenue. 

Other costs of revenue consist of miscellaneous
Marketplace-related expenses such as marketing and credit card processing fees and other commissions not associated with association
or transaction revenue. Other costs of revenue decreased by $21 or 27% to $56 as compared to $77 for the three-months ended October
31, 2015. 

Corporate Salaries, Wages and Employee
Benefits  

Salaries, wages and employee benefits include
expenses for employee salaries and wages, payroll taxes, payroll related insurance, healthcare benefits, stock-based compensation,
recruiting costs and other personnel related items. 

Salaries, wages and employee benefits expenses
for the three-months ended October 31, 2016, as compared to the three-months ended October 31, 2015, decreased by $26, or 6%. The
decrease is primarily due to a reduction in stock compensation expense. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  

Selling, general and administrative expenses
( SG A ), include consulting, legal and professional services, as well as expenses for rent and utilities, marketing,
business travel, insurance, bad debts, business taxes, and other expenses. As discussed above in  ITEX Dollar Revenue, 
certain ITEX dollar expenses are also included. 

SG A expenses for
the three-months ended October 31, 2016, as compared to the three-months ended October 31, 2015, decreased by $41 or 10%. The decrease
is due primarily to a decrease in legal fees, foreign currency expense and accounting fees. Legal fees decreased by $11, foreign
currency expense decreased by $4 and accounting fees decreased by $15 for the three-months ended October 31, 2016. 

Depreciation and Amortization  

Depreciation and amortization expenses include
depreciation on our fixed assets and amortization of our intangible assets. 

Depreciation and amortization for the three-months
ended October 31, 2016, as compared to the three-months ended October 31, 2015, decreased by $3, or 14%. 

Other income   

Other income includes interest received
on notes receivable and promissory notes. Interest income is derived primarily from our notes receivable for corporate-owned office
sales and general loans to brokers. 

15   

Income Taxes  

We recognized an $85 provision for income
taxes, in the three-month period ended October 31, 2016, as compared to the $80 provision for income taxes in the three-month period
ended October 31, 2015. 

The effective federal tax rate related to
our provision for income taxes in the three-month period ended October 31, 2016 is similar to that used in the period ended October
31, 2015. The effective state tax rate related to our provision for income taxes in the three-months ended October 31, 2016 is
1% higher than the three month period ended October 31, 2015 due to uncertain tax positions related primarily to state jurisdictions. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   

We finance our ongoing operations primarily
from existing cash, investing activities, and cash flows from operations. As of October 31, 2016, and July 31, 2016, we had $3,655
and $3,235, respectively, in cash. 

The following table
presents a summary of our cash flows for the three-months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands) (unaudited): 

We believe that our financial condition
is stable and that our cash balances, other liquid assets, and cash flows from operating activities provide adequate resources
to fund ongoing operating requirements. 

Inflation has not had a material impact
on our business. Inflation affecting the U.S. dollar is not expected to have a material effect on our operations in the foreseeable
future. 

Operating Activities  

For the three-months ended October 31, 2016,
net cash provided by operating activities was $363 compared with $360 in the three-months ended October 31, 2015 an increase of
$3, or 1%. 

16   

The difference
between our net income and our net cash provided by operating activities was attributable to non-cash expenses included in net
income, and changes in the operating assets and liabilities, as presented below (in thousands) (unaudited): 

Non-cash expenses
are primarily associated with the amortization of intangible assets, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, stock-based
compensation expense, and the changes in the deferred portion of the provision (benefit) for income taxes.   

Investing Activities   

Net cash provided by investing activities
was primarily the result of collections on notes receivable from corporate office sales and broker loans. 

For the three-months ended October 31, 2016,
net cash provided by investing activities was $63 compared with $67 provided by investing activities in the three-months ended
October 31, 2015, a decrease of $4, or 6%. In the three-months ended October 31, 2016, the net cash provided by investing activities
was related to $63 in note receivable principal collections. In the three-months ended October 31, 2015, the net cash provided
by investing activities was related to $67 in note receivable principal collections. 

Financing Activities  

Our net cash used in financing activities
consists of cash dividends to stockholders and discretionary repurchases of our common stock. 

For the three-months
ended October 31, 2016, net cash used in financing activities was $6 compared with $2 used in financing activities in the three-months
ended October 31, 2015, an increase of cash used in financing activities of $4. In the three-months ended October 31, 2016, we
purchased $7 of shares. In the three-months ended October 31, 2015, we purchased $3 of shares . 

Commitments  

The Company leases
office space under operating leases. Lease commitments include a lease for the Company s corporate headquarters in Bellevue,
Washington. In July 2016, we signed a 5-year lease for a new location in Bellevue, Washington, with a lease commencement date of
September 15, 2016. The lease expiration date is March 31, 2022. 

The lease expense for our executive office
space for the three-months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 was $33 and $21, respectively. 

17   

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates  

Our discussion
and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( GAAP ). The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate significant estimates
used in preparing our financial statements, including those related to: 

revenue recognition, including allowances for uncollectible accounts;   

accounting for ITEX dollar activities;   

the allocation of purchase price in business combinations;   

valuation of notes receivable;   

accounting for goodwill and other long-lived intangible assets;   

accounting for income taxes;   

share-based compensation; and   

litigation matters   

We base our estimates
on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ
from those in our assumptions. 

For a summary of all of our significant
accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies discussed above, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies, to our consolidated financial statements filed with our 2016 annual report on Form 10-K. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

For a discussion of new accounting pronouncements
and their impact on the Company, see  Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  included in this Form 10-Q.
