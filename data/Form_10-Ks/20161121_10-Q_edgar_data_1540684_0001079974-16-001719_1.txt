NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION, BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Organization and Description of Business 

Brazil Minerals, Inc. ("BMIX" or the "Company") was incorporated as Flux Technologies, Corp. under the laws of the State of Nevada, U.S. on December 15, 2011.  The Company, through subsidiaries, mines and sells diamonds, gold, sand and mortar. The Company, through subsidiaries, outright or jointly owns 10 mining concessions and 28 other mineral rights in Brazil, for diamonds, gold, and sand. The Company, through subsidiaries, owns a large alluvial diamond and gold processing and recovery plant, a sand processing and mortar plant, trucks and earth-moving capital equipment used for mining.

Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its 99.99% owned subsidiary, BMIX Participa  es Ltda. ("BMIX Subsidiary"), which includes the accounts of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Minera  o Duas Barras Ltda. ("MDB").

During the year ended December 31, 2014, the BMIX Subsidiary acquired an initial 25% interest in RST Recursos Minerais Ltda. ("RST"), and during the first quarter of 2015, it acquired an additional 25% interest in RST, thus bringing its total ownership of RST to 50%. As of March 18, 2015, RST has been consolidated within the Company's financial statements.

On April 17, 2015, the BMIX Subsidiary incorporated Hercules Resources Corporation ("HRC"). On May 27, 2015, HRC formalized title to 99.99% of Hercules Brasil Comercio e Transportes Ltda. ("Hercules Brasil"). Thus, as of December 31, 2015, Hercules Brasil is a wholly owned subsidiary and has been consolidated within the Company's consolidated financial statements.

On July 27, 2016,  upon approval by its Board of Directors, the Company entered into a stock purchase and sale agreement pursuant to which HRC transferred its 99.99% equity interest in  Minera  o Jupiter Ltda  to the Company which immediately thereafter sold such equity interest to Jupiter Gold Corporation ("JGC"), a newly created company. In addition, the Company simultaneously acquired all of the common stock of JGC.  As such, the accounts and results of JGC and MJL have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements. See Note 2 for more information.

All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. See subsequent events for discussion of an additional subsidiary formed subsequent to quarter end.

Going Concern 

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has limited working capital, has incurred losses in each of the past two years, and has not yet received material revenues from sales of products or services. These factors create substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustment that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company generating cash from its operations, the sale of its stock, and/or obtaining debt financing. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company funded operations through the receipt of proceeds from revenues, and the sale of equity and debt securities. Management's plan to fund its capital requirements and ongoing operations include an increase in cash received from sales primarily of gold derived from processing in a small, low operational cost gold plant its inventory of alluvial material and gravel already mined, as well as an increase in cash received from mortar and sand sales, all of which are expected to occur within the next two quarters. Management's secondary plan to cover any shortfall is selling its equity securities and obtaining debt financing. There can be no assurance the Company will be successful in these efforts.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Interim Consolidated Financial Statements 

The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.  Certain information and disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, all adjustments and disclosures necessary for a fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements have been included.  Such adjustments consist of normal recurring adjustments.  These interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2015. The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.

Basis of Presentation 

The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") of the United States of America and are presented in U.S. dollars.

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results may differ from those estimates.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The Company follows the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 820   Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure. Fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The guidance also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of our Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our Company's assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. The guidance establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

Level 1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;

Level 2. Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and

Level 3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company's derivative liabilities were considered a level 2 liability. See Note 4 for a discussion regarding the determination of the fair market value. The Company does not have any level 3 assets or liabilities.

BRAZIL MINERALS, INC.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company's financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, taxes recoverable, prepaid expenses, inventory, deposits and other assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses, deferred revenue and convertible notes payable. The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximates fair value due to either length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in these consolidated financial statements.

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents to the extent that the funds are not being held for investment purposes. The Company's bank accounts are deposited in FDIC insured institutions. Funds held in U.S. banks are insured up to $250,000 and funds held in Brazilian banks are insured up to 250,000 Brazilian Reais (translating into approximately $70,050 as of September 30, 2016).

Inventory 

Inventory for the Company consists of rough diamonds, gold, ore stockpile, parts, supplies and related production costs and is stated at lower of cost or market. The amount of any write-down of inventories to net realizable value and all losses, are recognized in the period the write-down of loss occurs. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, all inventory consisted primarily of rough ore stockpile for gold and diamonds. No value was placed on sand.

Value-Added Taxes Receivable 

The Company records a receivable for value added taxes recoverable from Brazilian authorities on goods and services purchased by its Brazilian subsidiaries. The Company intends to recover the taxes through the acquisition of capital equipment from sellers who accept tax credits as payments. On April 20, 2016, the Company's taxes receivable decreased by $50,100 with the recovery of such amount being used in the acquisition of a Mercedes Benz truck, through a state-government program.

Property and Equipment 

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Major improvements and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life. At the time of retirement or other disposition of property and equipment, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the statements of operations as other gain or loss, net.

The diamond and gold processing plant and other machinery are depreciated over an estimated useful life of 10 years; and computer and other office equipment over an estimated useful life of 3 years. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,  all property and equipment related to the diamond, sand and mortar processing plants and other production machinery except for approximately $1,300 in computer equipment. Accumulated depreciation as of  September 30, 2016 and December 31 , 2015, was $253,995 and $157,381, respectively. 

Mineral Properties 

Costs of exploration, carrying and retaining unproven mineral lease properties are expensed as incurred. Mineral property acquisition costs, including licenses and lease payments, are capitalized. Although the Company has taken steps to verify title to mineral properties in which it has an interest, these procedures do not guarantee the Company's rights. Such properties may be subject to prior agreements or transfers and title may be affected by undetected defects.

Impairment losses are recorded on mineral properties used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets' carrying amount. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not recognize any impairment losses related to mineral properties held.

BRAZIL MINERALS, INC.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Intangible Assets 

For intangible assets purchased in a business combination, the estimated fair values of the assets received are used to establish their recorded values. For intangible assets acquired in a non-monetary exchange, the estimated fair values of the assets transferred (or the estimated fair values of the assets received, if more clearly evident) are used to establish their recorded values, unless the values of neither the assets received nor the assets transferred are determinable within reasonable limits, in which case the assets received are measured based on the carrying values of the assets transferred. Valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, income approach and/or cost approach are used to measure fair value. Intangible assets consist of mineral right agreements held by MDB, RST, and MJL.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

For long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, the Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances are present, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell. 

Revenue Recognition 

The Company recognizes revenue when products are fully delivered or services have been provided and collection is reasonably assured.  Typically, the Company records revenues upon delivery of the products to the customer. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had deposits of $0 and $0, respectively, related to proceeds received for future diamond and gravel sales which have been recorded as customer deposits. See Note 4 and 6 for additional information related to these agreements.

Costs of Goods Sold 

Included within costs of goods sold are the costs of cutting and polishing rough diamonds, and costs of production such as diesel fuel, labor, and transportation.

Stock-Based Compensation 

The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. ASC 718 requires companies to measure compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation at fair value at the grant date and recognize the expense over the employee's requisite service period. Under ASC 718, volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock or the expected volatility of the stock of similar companies. The expected life assumption is primarily based on historical exercise patterns and employee post-vesting termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which was developed for use in estimating the fair value of options. Option-pricing models require the input of highly complex and subjective variables including the expected life of options granted and the expected volatility of our stock price over a period equal to or greater than the expected life of the options. Because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value of our employee stock options, it is management's opinion that the Black-Scholes option-pricing model may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of our employee stock options. Although the fair value of employee stock options is determined in accordance with ASC Topic 718 using an option-pricing model, that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer/willing seller market transaction.

BRAZIL MINERALS, INC.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company has adopted a stock plan to attract, retain and motivate its directors, officers, employees, consultants and advisors. The Company's stock plan provides for the issuance of up to 15,000,000 common shares for employees, consultants, directors, and advisors.

Foreign Currency 

The Company's foreign subsidiaries use a local currency as the functional currency. Resulting translation gains or losses are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Transaction gains or losses related to balances denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. Net foreign currency transaction losses included in the Company's consolidated statements of operations were negligible for all periods presented.

Income Taxes 

We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. ASC 740 requires a company to use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of, the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company's deferred tax assets had a full valuation allowance.

Under ASC 740, a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is "more likely than not" that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the "more likely than not" test, no tax benefit is recorded.  The Company has identified the United States Federal tax returns as its "major" tax jurisdiction. 

Basic Income (Loss) Per Share 

The Company computes loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share, which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. As of September 30, 2016, the Company's potentially dilutive securities relate to common stock issuable in connection with convertible notes payable, options and warrants. Dilutive loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. As of September 30, 2016, if all holders of preferred stock, convertible notes payable, options and warrants exercised their right to convert their securities to common stock, the common stock issuable would be in excess of the Company's authorized, but unissued shares of common stock.

Other Comprehensive Income 

Other comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources, other than net income and including foreign currency translation adjustments.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. This update requires capitalized debt issuance costs to be classified as a reduction to the carrying value of debt rather than a deferred charge, as is currently required. This update will be effective for the Company for all annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and is required to be adopted retroactively for all periods presented, and early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this ASU with no impact on the accompanying consolidated financial statements as the issuance costs were already accounted for as a reduction of the carrying value of the debt.

In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern", which requires management to evaluate, at each annual and interim reporting period, whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued and provide related disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. 

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The amendments in this update simplify the presentation of deferred taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. These amendments may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The amendments are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 840), to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The amendments in this standard are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, for a public entity. Early adoption of the amendments in this standard is permitted for all entities and the Company must recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the effect this guidance will have on its financial statements and related disclosures.

We have reviewed other recent accounting pronouncements issued to the date of the issuance of these consolidated financial statements, and we do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the Company.

NOTE 2  ACQUISITIONS

RST Recursos Minerais Ltda

In June 2014, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase 25% of the equity of RST for cash payments of 250,000 Brazilian Reais and the issuance of shares of the Company's common stock valued at 100,000 Brazilian Reais. In connection with this agreement the Company issued 1,428,572 shares of common stock with a value of $43,868 and made cash payments of $107,858. At December 31, 2014, the investment was accounted for using the equity method. Effective March 18, 2015, the Company purchased an additional 25% of RST from a third party for R$400,000 or $124,680. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company is to make monthly payments ranging from R$75,000 to R$100,000 beginning March 25, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, all required payments had been made. In December 2015, the  1,428,572 shares of common stock previously issued with a value of $43,868 were returned to the Company. The Company reversed the initial amount of the investment recorded upon return.

BRAZIL MINERALS, INC.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

As a result of the additional 25% acquired, the Company owns 50% of RST and has consolidated the operations in the Company as of March 18, 2015. The remaining 50% ownership is held by Brazil Mining, Inc. ("BMI"), an entity controlled through management and stock ownership by the Company's Chief Executive Officer. On the date of consolidation, the Company determined the fair market value of RST to be $570,548. The fair market value was based upon the average price paid by the Company for the 50% ownership, including the relief of monies advanced to RST and increasing for the non-controlling interest which represents 50%. The Company allocated 100% of the fair market value to the mineral rights held by RST. Since the date of acquisition, the value of the Brazilian Reais has decreased significantly, thus, has the value of the Company's intangibles.

The purpose of the Company's acquisition of RST was due to the quality of its mineral assets, close proximity to the Company's MDB diamond and gold processing plant, and attractive acquisition price. Pro-forma financial statements have not been provided as the assets, liabilities and operations of RST are not significant. The Company expects the future expected cash flows to exceed the carrying value of the assets due to the close proximity to MDB's plant which is expected to shorten the exploration period as new plant and equipment do not need to be procured.

Jupiter Gold Corporation and  Minera  o  Jupiter Ltda

On July 27, 2016,  upon approval by its Board of Directors, the Company entered into a stock purchase and sale agreement pursuant to which HRC transferred its 99.99% equity interest in MJL to the Company which immediately thereafter sold such equity interest to JGC.

The 192,000 shares of JGC common stock were valued at $192,000, or $1.00 per share, which represents fair market value as of such date. The 384,000 warrants are exercisable at $1.50 for a two year period from issuance. The JGC warrants were valued at $37,426 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions:  an exercise price of $1.50, a stock price of $1.00 on the date of grant, an expected dividend yield of 0%, an expected volatility of 40.0%, a risk free interest rate of 0.71% and an expected term of 2.0 years.

During December 2015, in satisfaction of the remaining receivable, BMI transferred the rights to two mineral right properties. At the time of the transfer, the Company's subsidiary RST retained a 50% ownership in these rights, thus, the value of the two mineral rights transferred is included within consolidation of RST. Thus, the Company recorded other expense of $93,580 during the year ended December 31, 2015 as the assets had already been reflected at their fair market value on the Company's financial statements. The Company agreed to the transaction to ensure there were no potential violations of the Sarbanes Oxley Act as the Company's CEO also controls BMI though management and stock holdings.

Item 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Report.

This Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements for Brazil Minerals, Inc. reflect current expectations, as of the date of this Quarterly Report, and involve certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward- looking statements as a result of various factors. Factors that could cause future results to materially differ from the recent results or those projected in forward-looking statements include: unprofitable efforts resulting not only from the failure to discover mineral deposits but also from finding mineral deposits that, though present, are insufficient in quantity and quality to return a profit from production; market fluctuations; government regulations, including regulations relating to royalties, allowable production, importing and exporting of minerals, and environmental protection; competition; the loss of services of key personnel; unusual or infrequent weather phenomena, sabotage, government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of infrastructure as well as general economic conditions .

General or Recent Developments 

Description of Business

Brazil Minerals, Inc. ("Brazil Minerals", the "Company", "we", "us", or "our"), together with its subsidiaries, is engaged in the business of acquiring   controlling positions or significant positions with oversight roles in companies in Brazil in the minerals area or in industries related to minerals.   We consolidate the results of our controlled subsidiaries in this Annual Report. 

Our progress has been steady, and can be measured in at least two quantifiable ways. First, in terms of mineral assets, in early 2013, our initial year of operations under the current business model and management team, we had 3 mineral rights. As of September 30, 2016, we had 38 mineral rights, as follows:

a) 
 
 10 mineral rights that are mining concessions, the highest level of mineral right in Brazil ("Concess o de Lavra");

b) 
 
 8 mineral rights that have status just below mining concession ("Requerimento de Lavra"), which allows us to apply for both an upgrade to mining concession and to conduct limited commercial mining;

c) 
 
 8 mineral rights in the research permit phase ("Autoriza  o de Resquisa"); and

d) 
 
 12 mineral rights in the phase of application for research permit ("Requerimento de Pesquisa").

The second manner in which we expanded as a company from 2013 to now is in the product mix output from our Brazilian subsidiaries. In 2013 we produced and sold rough diamonds and gold. In 2014 we added polished diamonds. In 2015 we added sand and mortar, a product made from our sand.

From 2013 to today, we have been taking shape as a holding company owner of different subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2016, we owned the approximate following stakes:

(1)            100% of BMIX Participa  es Ltda ("BMIXP");

(2)            100% of Minera  o Duas Barras Ltda ("MDB");

(4)            100% of Hercules Brasil Ltda. ("HBR");

(5)            60% of Jupiter Gold Corporation ("JGC").

Major Events in the Third Quarter of 2016

1)      Operational Focus

During the third quarter of 2016, Brazil Minerals focused its operational effort primarily in this area:

Development of Portable, Scalable, Higher Yield and Lower Cost Gold and Diamond Recovery Operations

During the third quarter of 2016 the Company successfully tested centrifugation as a means of recovery of gold.. Material which had been considered waste after processing in the gravity-based gold separation columns present in Brazil Minerals' original plant yielded recoverable gold after processing in centrifuges in amounts that indicated centrifugation to be significantly higher yielding. An initial small gold-recovery processing plant that uses two small centrifuges was delivered to Brazil Minerals at the end of the third quarter and placed in one of its mining concessions for gold. The operation is simple, utilizing two to three workers and a diesel-powered portable generator and produces gold from final alluvial material.

Subsequent to the end of the third quarter of 2016, this small plant is being expanded with the addition of machines and structures that will allow it to process thicker material, containing gravel and stones. It is also being outfitted to permit recovery of diamonds. Thicker material has higher gold concentration and contains diamonds.  

Brazil Minerals has mining areas spread over 60 miles along the banks of the Jequitinhonha River in Brazil, a well-known area for exploration of gold and diamonds. The Company envisions, over time, the deployment of several portable, scalable and low-cost, but highly efficacious plants to recover gold and diamonds from various locations simultaneously. 

2)      Improvements in Capital Structure

During the third quarter of 2016, Brazil Minerals continued to materially improve its capital structure as follows:

i)    Removal of Significant Variable-Rate Noteholder 

The entirety of the convertible debt from St. George Investments, LLC, a short-term oriented variable-rate noteholder has been extinguished. The Company has remaining convertible debt from one short-term oriented holder; all of the notes from such investor have a fixed floor price.

- 6 - 

ii)    Initial Formation of Mineral-Specific Subsidiaries 

Mineral-specific subsidiaries allow certain investors interested in one particular mineral (gold, manganese, etc.) to be able to more directly invest and/or partner in that mineral. Brazil Minerals intends to maintain an ongoing ownership stake in each such subsidiary and also intends that each subsidiary provide ongoing royalty payments to Brazil Minerals on revenue-generation from projects. The first such subsidiary is JGC, incorporated in the third quarter of 2016. JGC, through its subsidiary MJ, has since obtained six mineral rights for gold which were not owned by Brazil Minerals previously.

iii)    Extinguishment of $200,000 in Principal plus Accrued Interest 

The holders of certain of Brazil Minerals' convertible notes in an aggregate principal amount of $200,000 exchanged all such notes and their accrued interest into an aggregate of 80 million Brazil Minerals common shares plus securities of JGC. These notes would have matured on January 1, 2018, at which point Brazil Minerals would have to pay the $200,000 principal plus accrued interest. With the exchange described above, the entire liability comprising the $200,000 in principal and its accrued interest has been extinguished.

iv)  Extinguishment of 100% of Preferred C and 44% of Preferred B 

Brazil Minerals eliminated a large amount of preferred stock from its balance sheet during the third quarter of 2016. In particular, the Company eliminated 100% of its Preferred C Convertible Stock and approximately 44% of its Preferred B Convertible Stock by exchange of such Brazil Minerals preferred stock for securities of JGC, with cancellation of the preferred stock. Such elimination of Brazil Minerals preferred stock prevented a substantial potential dilution of the Brazil Minerals common shareholders since the preferred stock was convertible to common stock. 

v) Improvement in Book Value 

The Company has been involved in a concentrated effort to improve its financial condition. The Company's book value, while still a negative number, has increased since December 31, 2014 as shown below.

Results of Operations

Quarter Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Quarter Ended September 30, 2015

In the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we had revenues of $7,752 as compared to revenues of $18,326 in the quarter ended September 30, 2015, a decline of 57.70%. This result is due to the fact that the Company was awaiting deployment of a gold retrieval unit to restart production of gold.

Our consolidated cost of goods sold in the third quarter of 2016 was $47,461, consisting entirely of production-related expenses as compared to our consolidated cost of goods sold in the third quarter of 2015 of $8,573. These costs included labor, diesel, and machine rentals. Certain expenses were fixed or unavoidable in the third quarter of 2016 even though we had considerably less revenue than in the third quarter of 2015.

Our gross loss in the third quarter of 2016 was $39,709, as compared to our gross profit of $9,753 in the third quarter of 2015, a decline of 507.15%. This result was primarily due a decline in revenues and increase in costs of goods sold for the reasons detailed above.

We had an aggregate of $194,656 in operating expenses in the third second quarter of 2016, as compared to an aggregate of $213,588 in operating expenses in the third quarter of 2015, a decrease of 8.86%. This decrease was mostly due to lower general and administrative expenses, and no stock-based compensation, which more than compensated for higher professional fees and compensation and related costs.

- 7 - 

In the third quarter of 2016, we had total other expenses of $249,124 as compared to ($153,130) in total other expenses in the third quarter of 2015. This change was mostly due to much lower gain on derivative liabilities, a gain on interest on promissory notes, and much lower amortization of debt discount and other fees, and higher other expense in the quarter ended September 30, 2016.

In the third quarter of 2016, we experienced a net loss attributable to Brazil Minerals of $444,727, as compared to a net loss attributable to Brazil Minerals of $50,705 in the third quarter of 2015. This result was mostly due to the much higher total other expense and also higher operating expenses in the third quarter of 2016. On a per share basis (both basic and diluted), in both the third quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2015 we had net loss attributable to Brazil Minerals of $0.00. The higher net loss attributable to Brazil Minerals in the third quarter of 2016 was due to lower revenues, higher loss from operations and higher other expenses.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015

In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had revenues of $11,821 as compared to revenues of $58,512 in the quarter ended September 30, 2015, a decline of 79.80%. This result is due to the fact that the Company was awaiting deployment of a gold retrieval unit to restart production of gold in 2016.

Our consolidated cost of goods sold in the first nine months of 2016 was $112,293, consisting entirely of production expenses as compared to our consolidated cost of goods sold in the first nine months of 2015 of $145,599, a decline of 22.88%. These costs included labor, diesel and machine rentals.

Our gross loss in the first nine months of 2016 was $100,472, as compared to our gross loss of $87,087 in the first nine months of 2015, a decline of 15.37%. This result was primarily due a decline in gross revenues which was slightly offset by a decline in cost of goods sold during the nine months ended September 20, 2016, for the reasons detailed above.

We had an aggregate of $638,837 in operating expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to an aggregate of $672,409 in operating expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of 4.99%. This decrease was mostly due to lower professional fees, which more than offset increases in general and administrative expenses, compensation and related costs and stock-based compensation.

In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had total other expenses of $324,923 as compared to $153,313 in total other income in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This change was mostly due to a much lower gain on derivative liabilities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 which more than compensated for lower amortization of debt discounts and lower interest on promissory notes in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

- 8 - 

In the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we experienced a net loss attributable to Brazil Minerals of 1,039,455, as compared to a net loss attributable to Brazil Minerals of $606,183 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This result was mostly due to the higher total other expenses and lower revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 which more than offset lower costs of goods sold in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. On a per share basis (both basic and diluted), in both the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the nine months ended September 30, 2015 we had net loss attributable to Brazil Minerals of $0.00.  

Net cash used in operating activities was $368,092 in the first nine months of 2016, as compared to $618,864 in the first nine months of 2015. This was primarily due to the Company's mining a smaller surface area, as it developed its strategy of smaller, lower-cost but more efficient recovery plants in 2016. Net cash used in investing activities was $94,428 in the first nine months of 2016, as compared to $33,796 in the first nine months of 2015. This was primarily because of the acquisition of both certain capital equipment and intangible assets, such as mineral rights, in 2016. The Company acquired Net cash provided by financing activities was $372,340 in the first nine months of 2016, as compared to $932,060 in the first nine months of 2015. This was due to the fact that the Company needed to raise lesser funds from equity in debt in 2016.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of September 30, 2016, we had total current assets of $205,209 compared to total current liabilities of $1,117,510 for a current ratio of 0.18 to 1 and a working capital deficit of $912,301. By comparison, on September 30, 2015, we had total current assets of $262,429 compared to current liabilities of $1,404,594 for a current ratio of 0.19 to 1 and a working capital deficit of $1,142,165. This difference is explainable primarily by both a decrease in convertible debt and preferred stock outstanding.

In 2016 our principal sources of liquidity were the issuance of equity and debt securities. In 2015, our principal source of liquidity had been issuances of debt securities.

During the first quarter of 2016, we received an aggregate of $118,000 in gross proceeds from the sale of common stock in various transactions, none greater than $30,000 in size.

During the second quarter of 2016, we received $41,200 and $29,500 from sales of common stock in separate transactions or groups of transactions and $30,000 from the sale of a convertible note with a fixed-floor.

During the third quarter of 2016, we received a total of $25,000 from sales of Brazil Minerals' common stock, $20,000 from sales of Brazil Minerals' preferred stock, $31,000 from sales of common stock of a subsidiary of Brazil Minerals in separate transactions and a total of $110,000 from sales of convertible notes with a fixed-floor. All of these notes and all of Brazil Minerals' short-term oriented convertible debt are owned by only one relatively small entity. The Company does not expect this level of intake of debt to be the norm going forward.

We believe that, as the small portable plant for gold and diamond processing is finalized with the addition of the structure enabling it to process thicker material, funds generated from sales of gold, primarily, and diamonds, over time, recovered from such initial unit, plus sales of our mortar and sand, will generate enough revenues to make us cash flow positive, although no assurance of this can be given. In the meantime, we will rely on financing from the issuance of equity and/or debt, and/or sales of shares in mineral-specific subsidiaries, the availability of which on terms satisfactory to us is not assured.

The Company has no plans for any significant acquisitions in 2016 or in the foreseeable future that would require cash payments to be made by the Company while it is not cash flow positive.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, loans to a related party, accrued expenses, and an amount due to a director. The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximates fair value due either to length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in our financial statements. If our estimate of the fair value is incorrect at September 30, 2016, it could negatively affect our financial position and liquidity and could result in our having understated our net loss.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the financial statements. We have reviewed all recent accounting pronouncements issued to the date of the issuance of these financial statements, and we do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on us.

Item 2.  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

During the third quarter of 2016, we received $45,000 from sale of our common and preferred stock in separate transactions. The equity purchasers and amounts sold were as follows. We sold $20,000 in our Series B Convertible Preferred stock to Matthew Taylor in July of 2016. We sold $10,000 in our restricted common stock to Benjamin Khowong in July of 2016. We sold $8,000 in our restricted common stock to Craig Kincaid in July of 2016. We sold $7,000 in our restricted common stock to Peter Goldy in July of 2016.

All of the above shares were issued in accordance with exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act by virtue of being offered without employing any means of general solicitation and issued to purchasers which represented to the Company that they are accredited investors and that they were acquiring the shares for investment and could bear the economic risk of the investment.  All proceeds of the above described transactions were for use in the normal course of business of the Company.

Item 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K (  229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a "smaller reporting company," as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1).

Item 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the design, operation, and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2016. On the basis of that evaluation, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"), and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure were effective.

(b) Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and to our Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in  Internal Control Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on his evaluation under the framework in  Internal Control Integrated Framework,  he concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2016.

(c)   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Company added a full-time internal resource in Brazil to supplement and support outside accounting personnel it uses.

(d)    Limitations of the Effectiveness of Internal Controls

The effectiveness of the Company's system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting is subject to certain limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing and evaluating the control system, the assumptions used in identifying the likelihood of future events, and the inability to eliminate fraud and misconduct completely. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will detect all errors or fraud. However, the Company's control systems have been designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and the Company's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are effective at the reasonable assurance level.
