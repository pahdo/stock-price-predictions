Independent Film Development Corporation  

  Notes to     Condensed Consolidated 
 Financial Statements  

  June 30, 2016  

  (Unaudited)  

NOTE 1: HISTORY OF OPERATIONS  

Business Activity   

 Independent Film Development Corporation ( IFLM )
was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 14, 2007. The Company s current plan of operations consists of three
parts: 

To operate the Company s newly acquired
hospitality asset, C2C Restaurant Group, Inc. ( C2C ). The first restaurant to fall under C2C, Chef Eddie G s
Kitchen, was opened in December 2015 in Manhattan s East Harlem neighborhood in New York City. 

The development of content creation/distribution
projects, both in the form of original theatrical material as well as related and/or derivative programming related to the operations
of C2C. IFLM will pursue those projects that align with the company s strategic vision. 

The acquisition of real estate assets which
present value creation potential due to the complexity or illiquidity of their existing ownership and/or capital structure. In
such situations, IFLM will seek to actively work through the complexities, gain control of the asset, actively manage, recapitalize
and thereby create value. 

NOTE 2: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Basis of Unaudited Interim Financial
Information   

 The accompanying unaudited condensed   consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
( GAAP ) and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for interim financial information
and the SEC instructions to Form 10-Q, accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP
for completed financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary in order for the financial statements
to not be misleading have been reflected herein. Operating results for the interim period ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results that can be expected for the full year. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended September 30, 2015. 

Use of Estimates   

 In preparing financial statements in conformity
with U.S. GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of
expenses during the reporting period. Due to inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future
periods may be affected by changes in these estimates. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions.
These estimates and assumptions include valuing equity securities in share-based payment arrangements, estimating the fair value
of equity instruments recorded as derivative liabilities, and estimating the useful lives of amortizable assets and whether impairment
charges may apply. 

Principles of Consolidation   

 The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of Independent Film Development Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary C2C Restaurant Group, Inc. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 

Reclassifications   

 Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year
financial information to conform to the presentation used in the financial statements for the nine months ended June 30, 2016. 

Property and equipment   

  Property
and equipment are recorded at cost.  Major betterments that extend the useful lives of assets are also capitalized. Normal
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in operations. Depreciation is computed
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of three years. 

Inventories   

 Inventory is composed of mostly food products, beverages and
paper goods. Inventory is valued at cost. Due to the nature of the Company s inventory and its quick turn over a valuation
allowance is not necessary. As of June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 inventory was $4,750 and $0, respectively. 

Revenue recognition   

 The Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1
of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition, which has four basic criteria that must be met before revenue
is recognized: 1) existence of persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists; 2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered;
3) the seller s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable; and 4) collection is reasonably assured. The Company s
revenue is recognized when payment is tendered at the time of sale. The Company presents sales net of sales-related taxes. 

Segment Reporting   

 FASB ASC Topic 280,  Segment Reporting ,
requires use of the  management approach  model for segment reporting. The management approach model is based on the
way a company s management organizes segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing performance.
The Company determined it has one reportable segments. See Note 9. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

 The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10
of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37
of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( Paragraph 820-10-35-37 ) to measure the fair value of its financial
instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  To increase consistency
and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy
which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels.  The fair value
hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the
lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described
below: 

Level 1: Quoted market prices available in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. 

 Level 2: Pricing inputs other
than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting
date. 

 Level 3: Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs
and not corroborated by market data. 

The carrying amount of the Company s
financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the
short maturity of those instruments.  The Company s notes payable approximates the fair value of such instruments based
upon management s best estimate of interest rates that would be available to the Company for similar financial arrangements
at June 30, 2016. 

The following table presents assets and liabilities
that are measured and recognized at fair value as of June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 on a recurring basis: 

June 30, 2016  

September 30, 2015  

Derivative Liabilities   

 The Company records the fair value of its derivative
financial instruments in accordance with ASC815,  Derivatives and Hedging . The fair value of the derivatives was calculated
using a multi-nomial lattice model performed by an independent qualified business valuator. The fair value of the derivative liability
is revalued on each balance sheet date with corresponding gains and losses recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 

Derivative financial instruments should be
recorded as liabilities in the balance sheet and measured at fair value. For purposes of the Company s financial statements
fair value was used as the basis for formulating an analysis which has been defined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
( FASB ) as  the amount for which an asset (or liability) could be exchanged in a current transaction between
knowledgeable, unrelated willing parties when neither party is acting under compulsion . The FASB has provided guidance that
its definition of fair value is consistent with the definition of fair market value in IRS Rev. Rule 59-60. In determining the
fair value of the derivatives it was assumed that the Company s business would be conducted as a going concern. These derivative
liabilities will need to be marked-to-market each quarter with the change in fair value recorded in the income statement. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

 The Company has implemented all new accounting
pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise
disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that
might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 

NOTE 3: ACQUISITIONS  

On September 21, 2015, the Company entered
into a share purchase agreement, by and among the Company, C2C Restaurant Group, Inc., a New York corporation and a restaurant
holding company ( C2C ), and the shareholders of C2C, pursuant to which the Company purchased all of the outstanding
common stock of C2C in exchange for 20,000 shares of our Series F preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per. Based upon an independent
third party valuation the purchase was fair valued in two parts. First, a value of $5,600 was capitalized as a trade name for Chef
Eddie G's Kitchen. Second the Company recorded goodwill in the amount of $117,754. The location for C2C s first restaurant,
Chef Eddie G's Kitchen, opened in December on Park Avenue in Manhattan, New York. 

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase
price over the underlying net assets of businesses acquired. The Company complies with ASC 350,  Goodwill and Other Indefinite
Lived Intangible Assets , requiring that a test for impairment be performed at least annually. As of September 30, 2015 the
Company performed the required impairment analysis which resulted in the impairment of both the goodwill and trade name valuation
amounts in their entirety. The Company recorded impairment expense of $122,354.  

NOTE 4: PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT  

Property and equipment, stated at cost, less
accumulated depreciation consisted of the following: 

Depreciation expense for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $2,084 and $0, respectively.

NOTE 6: CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE  

On April 9, 2012, the Company entered into
a $100,000 convertible debenture with Neil Linder. The debenture accrued interest of 12% and matured on April 9, 2013. Mr. Linder
has the right to convert all or a portion of the principal into shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to the lesser
of fifty percent (50%) of the average of the closing bid price of common stock during the five trading days immediately preceding
the conversion date, or fifty percent (50%) of the closing bid price of the Common Stock on the date of issuance as quoted by Bloomberg,
LP. Pursuant to the terms of this debenture, the holder shall not be entitled to convert a number of shares that would exceed 4.99%
of the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock. Based on the initial valuation the Company has recorded a debt discount
of $49,532, $15,994 of which was amortized in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 with the remaining $33,538 amortized the
fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. During the fiscal year ending September 30, 2013, $13,950 of the $100,000 debenture was converted
into 821 shares of common stock. This conversion was converted within the terms of the agreement. On March 30, 2015, $4,000 of
accrued interest was converted into 1,600 shares of common stock. In addition, as a consequence of the triggering of the default
provision of the debenture the interest on the debenture has been instated at a rate of 18%, a $1,000 per business day penalty
was being imposed for failure to execute a conversion in a timely manner, and an additional accrual of $112,509 was accounted for
as a result of a provision requiring additional funds due in the event that a  default payment  is made by the Company.

continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has generated minimal revenue and has an accumulated deficit of $12,926,556
and has funded its operations primarily through the issuance of short term debt and equity. This matter raises substantial doubt
about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 

 These financial statements do not include any
adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities
that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, the Company s ability to
accomplish its business strategy and to ultimately achieve profitable operations is dependent upon its ability to obtain additional
debt or equity financing. Management plans to take the following steps that it believes will be sufficient to provide the Company
with the ability to continue in existence. 

Management intends to raise financing through
private equity financing or other means and interests that it deems necessary. There can be no assurance that the Company will
be successful in its endeavor.

Item 2:  Management s Discussion and Analysis
or Plan of Operation  

The following discussion of our financial condition
and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes to the financial statements
included elsewhere in this filing as well as with Management s Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operations contained in
the Company s Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended September 30, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Forward Looking Statements  

Certain matters discussed herein are forward-looking
statements. Such forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q involve risks and uncertainties, including statements as
to: 

our future operating results;   

our business prospects;   

our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties;   

the dependence of our future success on the general economy;   

our possible future financings; and   

the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital.   

These forward-looking statements can generally
be identified as such because the context of the statement will include words such as we  believe,   anticipate, 
 expect,   estimate  or words of similar meaning. Similarly, statements that describe our future plans,
objectives or goals are also forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties
which are described in close proximity to such statements and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those
anticipated. Shareholders, potential investors and other readers are urged to consider these factors in evaluating the forward-looking
statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included
herein are only made as of the date of this Form 10-Q, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update such forward-looking statements
to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 

Plan of Operations  

The Company s current plan of operations
consists of three parts: 

To begin operations of IFLM s newly acquired
hospitality asset, C2C Restaurant Group ( C2C ). The first restaurant to fall under C2C, Chef Eddie G s Kitchen,
was opened in December 2015 in Manhattan s East Harlem neighborhood in New York City. 

The development of content creation/distribution
projects, both in the form of original theatrical material as well as related and/or derivative programming related to the operations
of C2C. IFLM will pursue those projects that align with the company s strategic vision. 

The acquisition of real estate assets which
present value creation potential due to the complexity or illiquidity of their existing ownership and/or capital structure. In
such situations, IFLM will seek to actively work through the complexities, gain control of the asset, actively manage, recapitalize
and thereby create value. 

IFLM possesses a small video and film library. 

Results of Operations   Three Months Ended June 30, 2016
as Compared to the Three Months Ended June 30, 2015  

Sales and cost of sales  

 During the three months ended June 30, 2016,
sales from our new subsidiary C2C Restaurant Group, Inc. ( C2C ), which opened its first location in December 2015
in New York City, were $58,406. Cost of sales was $34,087 for a gross margin of $24,319. 

Operating Expenses  

 Professional fees for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 were $20,558, as compared to $6,445 for the three months ended June 30, 2015, an increase of $14,113 or 219%.  Professional
fees mainly consist of legal, auditor and other fees associated with the Company s quarterly filings and year-end audit. 

Officer compensation expense for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $109,500 to $32,500 as compared to $142,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2015.  The
expense consists of cash payments, accrued salary and stock. The decrease in compensation is due to no stock issued for compensation
in the current period as well as a decrease in officer compensation in an effort to reduce liabilities. 

General and administrative expense increased
$180,646 to $193,713 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from $13,067 for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The increase
in the current period can be attributed to expenses incurred with the setup, opening and operating the restaurant. 

Other Expense  

 Total other expense decreased from other income
of $141,227 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 to other expense of $220,342 for the three months ended June 30, 2016. In
the prior year we recognized a gain on settlement of debt of $134,250 and a $45,000 gain on extinguishment of debt. In the current
period we had a $54,475 loss on derivative and $165,867 of interest expense. 

Net Loss  

 We recorded a net loss of $442,794 for the
three months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to $20,285 for the three months ended June 30, 2015. 

Results of Operations   Nine Months Ended June 30, 2016
as Compared to the Nine Months Ended June 30, 2015  

Sales and cost of sales  

 During the nine months ended June 30, 2016,
sales from our new subsidiary C2C Restaurant Group, Inc. ( C2C ), which opened its first location in December 2015
in New York City, were $101,327. Cost of sales was $54,556 for a gross margin of $46,771. 

Operating Expenses  

 Professional fees for the nine months ended
June 30, 2016 were $33,033, as compared to $30,281 for the nine months ended June 30, 2015, an increase of $2,752 or .09%.  Professional
fees mainly consist of legal, auditor and other fees associated with the Company s quarterly filings and year-end audit. 

Officer compensation expense for the nine months
ended June 30, 2016 decreased $268,001 or 71.8% to $105,000 as compared to $373,001 for the nine months ended June 30, 2015.  The
expense consists of cash payments, accrued salary and stock. The decrease in compensation is due to no stock issued for compensation
in the current period as well as a decrease in officer compensation in an effort to reduce liabilities. 

General and administrative expense increased
$419,117 to $447,004 for the nine months ended June 30, 2016 from $27,887 for the nine months ended June 30, 2015. The increase
in the current period can be attributed to expenses incurred with the setup, opening and operating the restaurant as well as $235,000
of consulting expense. 

Other Expense  

 Total other expense decreased from $3,117,171
for the nine months ended June 30, 2015 to $335,563 for the nine months ended June 30, 2016. In the prior year we recognized a
loss on settlement of debt of $2,973,250 as well as a $12,503 loss on derivative, a $31,875 penalty expense and $144,543 of interest
expense. In the current period we had a $49,964 loss on derivative and $285,599 of interest expense. 

Net Loss  

 We recorded a net loss of $873,829 for the
nine months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to $3,548,340 for the nine months ended June 30, 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

 At June 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit
of $12,926,556 and a working capital deficit of $2,384,842. For the nine months ended June 30, 2016, net cash used in operating
activities was $223,068 and we received $260,481 from financing activities. 

While we are attempting to increase operations
and revenues, our cash position may not be significant enough to support the Company s daily operations. Management
intends to raise additional funds by way of debt and equity financing.  We believe that the actions presently being taken
to further implement our business plan and generate increased revenues provide the 

opportunity for the Company to continue as
a going concern.   While we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate increased revenues and in our ability to
raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect.  The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern
is dependent upon the Company s ability to further implement its business plan and generate increased revenues. 

Critical Accounting Estimates
and Policies  

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Note
1 to the Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Financial
Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, contingencies and taxes.  Actual results could differ materially from
those estimates. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates
used in the preparation of the Financial Statements. 

FASB ASC Topic 280,  Segment Reporting ,
requires use of the  management approach  model for segment reporting. The management approach model is based on the
way a company s management organizes segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing performance.
The Company determined it has one reportable segments. See Note 7. 

We recognize deferred tax assets (future tax
benefits) and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and
the tax basis of assets and liabilities.  The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the expected future tax return
consequences of those differences, which are expected to be either deductible or taxable when the assets and liabilities are recovered
or settled.  Future tax benefits have been fully offset by a 100% valuation allowance as management is unable to determine
that it is more likely than not that this deferred tax asset will be realized. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We have not entered into any off-balance sheet
arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered
material to investors. 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk  

Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. 

Item 4: Controls and Procedures  

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )
that are designed to be effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ), and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation,
they concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2016. 

In designing and evaluating disclosure controls
and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute assurance of achieving the desired objectives. Also, the design of a control system must reflect the fact
that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. 

Changes in Internal Controls  

Our management, with the participation
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation to determine whether any change in our
internal controls over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2016.  Based on that evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that no change occurred in the Company's internal
controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company's internal controls over financial reporting. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings  

There are not presently any material pending
legal proceedings to which the Company is a party or as to which any of our property is subject, and no such proceedings are known
to the Company to be threatened or contemplated against it. 

Item 1A Risk Factors  

We are a smaller reporting company as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and, as such, are not required to provide the information under this Item.

 8% CONVERTIBLE REDEEMABLE NOTE 

 DUE APRIL 6, 2017 

FOR VALUE RECEIVED,
Independent Film Development Corp. (the  Company ) promises to pay to the order of CERBERUS FINANCE GROUP, LTD and
its authorized successors and permitted assigns (  Holder  ), the aggregate principal face amount of Nineteen Thousand
Six Hundred Eighty Seven Dollars 50/100 cents exactly (U.S. $19,687.50) on April 6, 2017 (  Maturity Date  ) and
to pay interest on the principal amount outstanding hereunder at the rate of 8% per annum commencing on April 6, 2016. The interest
will be paid to the Holder in whose name this Note is registered on the records of the Company regarding registration and transfers
of this Note. The principal of, and interest on, this Note are payable at Craigmuir Chambers, Road Town, Tortola VG 1110, British
Virgin Islands , initially, and if changed, last appearing on the records of the Company as designated in writing by the Holder
hereof from time to time. The Company will pay each interest payment and the outstanding principal due upon this Note before or
on the Maturity Date, less any amounts required by law to be deducted or withheld, to the Holder of this Note by check or wire
transfer addressed to such Holder at the last address appearing on the records of the Company. The forwarding of such check or
wire transfer shall constitute a payment of outstanding principal hereunder and shall satisfy and discharge the liability for principal
on this Note to the extent of the sum represented by such check or wire transfer. Interest shall be payable in Common Stock (as
defined below) pursuant to paragraph 4(b) herein. 

This Note is subject
to the following additional provisions: 

1. This Note is exchangeable for
an equal aggregate principal amount of Notes of different authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering the
same. No service charge will be made for such registration or transfer or exchange, except that Holder 

Initials:  JR    1       

shall pay any tax or other governmental
charges payable in connection therewith. 

2. The Company shall be entitled
to withhold from all payments any amounts required to be withheld under applicable laws. 

3. This Note may be transferred
or exchanged only in compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (  Act  ) and applicable state securities
laws. Any attempted transfer to a non-qualifying party shall be treated by the Company as void. Prior to due presentment for transfer
of this Note, the Company and any agent of the Company may treat the person in whose name this Note is duly registered on the Company's
records as the owner hereof for all other purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company nor any such agent
shall be affected or bound by notice to the contrary. Any Holder of this Note electing to exercise the right of conversion set
forth in Section 4(a) hereof, in addition to the requirements set forth in Section 4(a), and any prospective transferee of this
Note, also is required to give the Company written confirmation that this Note is being converted (  Notice of Conversion  )
in the form annexed hereto as  Exhibit A . The date of receipt (including receipt by telecopy) of such Notice of Conversion
shall be the Conversion Date. 

4. (a) The Holder of this Note
is entitled, at its option, at any time, to convert all or any amount of the principal face amount of this Note then outstanding
into shares of the Company's common stock (the   Common Stock  ) at a price (  Conversion Price  )
for each share of Common Stock equal to 50% of   lowest trading price   of the Common Stock as reported on the National
Quotations Bureau OTC Marketplace exchange which the Company s shares are traded or any exchange upon which the Common Stock
may be traded in the future (  Exchange  ), for the   twenty     prior   trading days including
the day upon which a Notice of Conversion is received by the Company or its transfer agent (provided such Notice of Conversion
is delivered by fax or other electronic method of communication to the Company or its transfer agent after 4 P.M. Eastern Standard
or Daylight Savings Time if the Holder wishes to include the same day closing price). If the shares have not been delivered within
3 business days, the Notice of Conversion may be rescinded. Such conversion shall be effectuated by the Company delivering the
shares of Common Stock to the Holder within 3 business days of receipt by the Company of the Notice of Conversion. Accrued but
unpaid interest shall be subject to conversion. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractions of shares will be issued on
conversion, but the number of shares issuable shall be rounded to the nearest whole share .  To the extent the Conversion
Price of the Company s Common Stock closes below the par value per share, the Company will take all steps necessary to solicit
the consent of the stockholders to reduce the par value to the lowest value possible under law. The Company agrees to honor all
conversions submitted pending this increase.  In the event the Company experiences a DTC  Chill  on its shares, the
conversion price shall be decreased to 40% instead of 50% while that  Chill  is in effect.   If the Company violates
Section 4(e) of the Securities Purchase Agreement, the conversion discount shall be increased by 20% to reflect a net conversion
discount of 70%.  In no event shall the Holder be allowed to effect a conversion if such conversion, along with all other shares
of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates would exceed 9.9% of the outstanding shares of the
Common Stock of the Company. 

Initials:  JR    2       

(b) Interest on any unpaid principal
balance of this Note shall be paid at the rate of 8% per annum. Interest shall be paid by the Company in cash only. 

(c) During the first six months
this Note is in effect, the Company may redeem this Note by paying to the Holder an amount as follows: (i) if the note is prepaid
within 60 days of the issuance date, then at 130% of the face amount plus any accrued interest; (ii) if the note is prepaid after

to pay interest on the principal amount outstanding hereunder at the rate of 8% per annum commencing on April 6, 2016. The interest

of this Note. The principal of, and interest on, this Note are payable at 1218 Union Street, Suite #2, Brooklyn, NY 11225, initially,
and if changed, last appearing on the records of the Company as designated in writing by the Holder hereof from time to time. The
Company will pay each interest payment and the outstanding principal due upon this Note before or on the Maturity Date, less any
amounts required by law to be deducted or withheld, to the Holder of this Note by check or wire transfer addressed to such Holder
at the last address appearing on the records of the Company. The forwarding of such check or wire transfer shall constitute a payment
of outstanding principal hereunder and shall satisfy and discharge the liability for principal on this Note to the extent of the
sum represented by such check or wire transfer. Interest shall be payable in Common Stock (as defined below) pursuant to paragraph
4(b) herein. 

This Note is subject
to the following additional provisions: 

1. This Note is exchangeable for
an equal aggregate principal amount of Notes of different authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering the
same. No service charge will be made for such registration or transfer or exchange, except that Holder 

Initials:  JR    1       

shall pay any tax or other governmental
charges payable in connection therewith. 

2. The Company shall be entitled
to withhold from all payments any amounts required to be withheld under applicable laws. 

3. This Note may be transferred
or exchanged only in compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (  Act  ) and applicable state securities
laws. Any attempted transfer to a non-qualifying party shall be treated by the Company as void. Prior to due presentment for transfer
of this Note, the Company and any agent of the Company may treat the person in whose name this Note is duly registered on the Company's
records as the owner hereof for all other purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company nor any such agent
shall be affected or bound by notice to the contrary. Any Holder of this Note electing to exercise the right of conversion set
forth in Section 4(a) hereof, in addition to the requirements set forth in Section 4(a), and any prospective transferee of this
Note, also is required to give the Company written confirmation that this Note is being converted (  Notice of Conversion  )
in the form annexed hereto as  Exhibit A . The date of receipt (including receipt by telecopy) of such Notice of Conversion
shall be the Conversion Date. 

4. (a) The Holder of this Note
is entitled, at its option, at any time, to convert all or any amount of the principal face amount of this Note then outstanding
into shares of the Company's common stock (the   Common Stock  ) at a price (  Conversion Price  )
for each share of Common Stock equal to 50% of   lowest trading price   of the Common Stock as reported on the National
Quotations Bureau OTC Marketplace exchange which the Company s shares are traded or any exchange upon which the Common Stock
may be traded in the future (  Exchange  ), for the   twenty     prior   trading days including
the day upon which a Notice of Conversion is received by the Company or its transfer agent (provided such Notice of Conversion
is delivered by fax or other electronic method of communication to the Company or its transfer agent after 4 P.M. Eastern Standard
or Daylight Savings Time if the Holder wishes to include the same day closing price). If the shares have not been delivered within
3 business days, the Notice of Conversion may be rescinded. Such conversion shall be effectuated by the Company delivering the
shares of Common Stock to the Holder within 3 business days of receipt by the Company of the Notice of Conversion. Accrued but
unpaid interest shall be subject to conversion. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractions of shares will be issued on
conversion, but the number of shares issuable shall be rounded to the nearest whole share .  To the extent the Conversion
Price of the Company s Common Stock closes below the par value per share, the Company will take all steps necessary to solicit
the consent of the stockholders to reduce the par value to the lowest value possible under law. The Company agrees to honor all
conversions submitted pending this increase.  In the event the Company experiences a DTC  Chill  on its shares, the
conversion price shall be decreased to 40% instead of 50% while that  Chill  is in effect.   If the Company violates
Section 4(e) of the Securities Purchase Agreement, the conversion discount shall be increased by 20% to reflect a net conversion
discount of 70%.  In no event shall the Holder be allowed to effect a conversion if such conversion, along with all other shares
of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates would exceed 9.9% of the outstanding shares of the
Common Stock of the Company. 

Initials:  JR    2

within 60 days of the issuance date, then at 130% of the face amount plus any accrued interest; (ii) if the note is prepaid after
60 days after the issuance date but less than 121 days after the issuance date, then at 140% of the face amount plus any accrued
interest and (iii) if the note is prepaid after 120 days after the issuance date but less than 180 days after the issuance date,
then at 150% of the face amount plus any accrued interest. This Note may not be prepaid after the 180 th  day. Such redemption
must be closed and funded within 3 days of giving notice of redemption of the right to redeem shall be null and void. If the Company

or entity in which the Company is not the surviving entity (other than a merger which is effected solely to change the jurisdiction
of incorporation of the Company and results in a reclassification, conversion or exchange of outstanding shares of Common Stock
solely into shares of Common Stock) (each of items (i), (ii) and (iii) being referred to as a  Sale Event ), then, in
each case, the Company shall, upon request of the Holder, redeem this Note in cash for 150% of the principal amount, plus accrued
but unpaid interest through the date of redemption, or at the election of the Holder, such Holder may convert the unpaid principal
amount of this Note (together with the amount of accrued but unpaid interest) into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to

(not to include a sale of all or substantially all of the Company s assets) in connection with which this Note is not redeemed
or converted, the Company shall cause effective provision to be made so that the Holder of this Note shall have the right thereafter,

of the number of shares of Common Stock that could have been purchased upon exercise of the Note and at the same Conversion Price,
as defined in this Note, immediately prior to such Sale Event. The foregoing provisions shall similarly apply to successive Sale
Events. If the consideration received by the holders of Common Stock is other than cash, the value shall be as determined by the

authorized successors and permitted assigns (  Holder  ), the aggregate principal face amount of Nineteen Thousand
Six Hundred Eighty Seven Dollars 50/100 cents exactly (U.S. $19,687.50) on June 10, 2017 (  Maturity Date  ) and
to pay interest on the principal amount outstanding hereunder at the rate of 8% per annum commencing on June 10, 2016. The interest
will be paid to the Holder in whose name this Note is registered on the records of the Company regarding registration and transfers
of this Note. The principal of, and interest on, this Note are payable at 1218 Union Street, Suite #2, Brooklyn, NY 11225, initially,
and if changed, last appearing on the records of the Company as designated in writing by the Holder hereof from time to time. The
Company will pay each interest payment and the outstanding principal due upon this Note before or on the Maturity Date, less any
amounts required by law to be deducted or withheld, to the Holder of this Note by check or wire transfer addressed to such Holder
at the last address appearing on the records of the Company. The forwarding of such check or wire transfer shall constitute a payment
of outstanding principal hereunder and shall satisfy and discharge the liability for principal on this Note to the extent of the
sum represented by such check or wire transfer. Interest shall be payable in Common Stock (as defined below) pursuant to paragraph
4(b) herein. 

This Note is subject
to the following additional provisions: 

1. This Note is exchangeable for
an equal aggregate principal amount of Notes of different authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering the
same. No service charge will be made for such registration or transfer or exchange, except that Holder 

Initials:
                                          JR    1       

shall pay any tax or other governmental
charges payable in connection therewith. 

2. The Company shall be entitled
to withhold from all payments any amounts required to be withheld under applicable laws. 

3. This Note may be transferred
or exchanged only in compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (  Act  ) and applicable state securities
laws. Any attempted transfer to a non-qualifying party shall be treated by the Company as void. Prior to due presentment for transfer
of this Note, the Company and any agent of the Company may treat the person in whose name this Note is duly registered on the Company's
records as the owner hereof for all other purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company nor any such agent
shall be affected or bound by notice to the contrary. Any Holder of this Note electing to exercise the right of conversion set
forth in Section 4(a) hereof, in addition to the requirements set forth in Section 4(a), and any prospective transferee of this
Note, also is required to give the Company written confirmation that this Note is being converted (  Notice of Conversion  )
in the form annexed hereto as  Exhibit A . The date of receipt (including receipt by telecopy) of such Notice of Conversion
shall be the Conversion Date. 

4. (a) The Holder of this Note
is entitled, at its option, at any time, to convert all or any amount of the principal face amount of this Note then outstanding
into shares of the Company's common stock (the   Common Stock  ) at a price (  Conversion Price  )
for each share of Common Stock equal to 50% of   lowest trading price   of the Common Stock as reported on the National
Quotations Bureau OTC Marketplace exchange which the Company s shares are traded or any exchange upon which the Common Stock
may be traded in the future (  Exchange  ), for the   twenty     prior   trading days including
the day upon which a Notice of Conversion is received by the Company or its transfer agent (provided such Notice of Conversion
is delivered by fax or other electronic method of communication to the Company or its transfer agent after 4 P.M. Eastern Standard
or Daylight Savings Time if the Holder wishes to include the same day closing price). If the shares have not been delivered within
3 business days, the Notice of Conversion may be rescinded. Such conversion shall be effectuated by the Company delivering the
shares of Common Stock to the Holder within 3 business days of receipt by the Company of the Notice of Conversion. Accrued but
unpaid interest shall be subject to conversion. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractions of shares will be issued
on conversion, but the number of shares issuable shall be rounded to the nearest whole share .  To the extent the Conversion
Price of the Company s Common Stock closes below the par value per share, the Company will take all steps necessary to solicit
the consent of the stockholders to reduce the par value to the lowest value possible under law. The Company agrees to honor all
conversions submitted pending this increase.  In the event the Company experiences a DTC  Chill  on its shares,
the conversion price shall be decreased to 40% instead of 50% while that  Chill  is in effect.   If the Company
violates Section 4(e) of the Securities Purchase Agreement, the conversion discount shall be increased by 20% to reflect a net
conversion discount of 70%.  In no event shall the Holder be allowed to effect a conversion if such conversion, along with
all other shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates would exceed 9.9% of the outstanding
shares of the Common Stock of the Company. 

Initials: JR   2       

(b) Interest on any unpaid principal
balance of this Note shall be paid at the rate of 8% per annum. Interest shall be paid by the Company in cash only. 

(c) During the first six months
this Note is in effect, the Company may redeem this Note by paying to the Holder an amount as follows: (i) if the note is prepaid
within 60 days of the issuance date, then at 130% of the face amount plus any accrued interest; (ii) if the note is prepaid after
60 days after the issuance date but less than 121 days after the issuance date, then at 140% of the face amount plus any accrued
interest and (iii) if the note is prepaid after 120 days after the issuance date but less than 180 days after the issuance date,
then at 150% of the face amount plus any accrued interest. This Note may not be prepaid after the 180 th  day. Such redemption
must be closed and funded within 3 days of giving notice of redemption of the right to redeem shall be null and void. If the Company
violates Section 4(e) of the Securities Purchase Agreement, the prepay premium shall be increased by 20%. 

(d)  Upon (i) a transfer of all
or substantially all of the assets of the Company to any person in a single transaction or series of related transactions, (ii)
a reclassification, capital reorganization or other change or exchange of outstanding shares of the Common Stock, other than a
forward or reverse stock split or stock dividend, or (iii) any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another person
or entity in which the Company is not the surviving entity (other than a merger which is effected solely to change the jurisdiction
of incorporation of the Company and results in a reclassification, conversion or exchange of outstanding shares of Common Stock
solely into shares of Common Stock) (each of items (i), (ii) and (iii) being referred to as a  Sale Event ), then, in
each case, the Company shall, upon request of the Holder, redeem this Note in cash for 150% of the principal amount, plus accrued
but unpaid interest through the date of redemption, or at the election of the Holder, such Holder may convert the unpaid principal
amount of this Note (together with the amount of accrued but unpaid interest) into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to
such Sale Event at the Conversion Price. 

(e)  In case of any Sale Event
(not to include a sale of all or substantially all of the Company s assets) in connection with which this Note is not redeemed
or converted, the Company shall cause effective provision to be made so that the Holder of this Note shall have the right thereafter,
by converting this Note, to purchase or convert this Note into the kind and number of shares of stock or other securities or property
(including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, capital reorganization or other change, consolidation or merger by a holder
of the number of shares of Common Stock that could have been purchased upon exercise of the Note and at the same Conversion Price,
as defined in this Note, immediately prior to such Sale Event. The foregoing provisions shall similarly apply to successive Sale
Events. If the consideration received by the holders of Common Stock is other than cash, the value shall be as determined by the
Board of Directors of the Company or successor person or entity acting in good faith. 

5. No provision of this Note shall
alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, and interest on, this
Note at the time, place, and rate, and in the form, herein prescribed. 

6. The Company hereby expressly
waives demand and presentment for payment,

7. The Company agrees to pay all
costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, which may be incurred by the Holder in collecting any amount
due under this Note. 

8. If one or more of the following
described  Events of Default  shall occur: 

(a) The Company shall default in
the payment of principal or interest on this Note or any other note issued to the Holder by the Company; or 

(b) Any of the representations
or warranties made by the Company herein or in any certificate or financial or other written statements heretofore or hereafter
furnished by or on behalf of the Company in connection with the execution and delivery of this Note, or the Securities Purchase
Agreement under which this note was issued shall be false or misleading in any respect; or 

(c) The Company shall fail to perform
or observe, in any respect, any covenant, term, provision, condition, agreement or obligation of the Company under this Note or
any other note issued to the Holder; or 

(d) The Company shall (1) become
insolvent; (2) admit in writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they mature; (3) make an assignment for the benefit
of creditors or commence proceedings for its dissolution; (4) apply for or consent to the appointment of a trustee, liquidator
or receiver for its or for a substantial part of its property or business; (5) file a petition for bankruptcy relief, consent to
the filing of such petition or have filed against it an involuntary petition for bankruptcy relief, all under federal or state
laws as applicable; or 

(e) A trustee, liquidator or receiver

or filed against the Company or any of its properties or other assets and shall remain unpaid, unvacated, unbonded or unstayed
for a period of fifteen (15) days or in any event later than five (5) days prior to the date of any proposed sale thereunder; or 

(h) The Company shall have defaulted
on or breached any term of any other 

Initials: JR   4       

note of similar debt instrument into which
the Company has entered and failed to cure such default within the appropriate grace period; or 

(i) The Company shall have its
Common Stock delisted from a trading market (including the OTC QB market) or, if the Common Stock trades on an exchange, then trading
in the Common Stock shall be suspended for more than 10 consecutive days or ceases to file its 1934 act reports with the SEC; 

(j) If a majority of the members
of the Board of Directors of the Company on the date hereof are no longer serving as members of the Board; 

(k) The Company shall not deliver
to the Holder the Common Stock pursuant to paragraph 4 herein without restrictive legend within 3 business days of its receipt

(l)  The Company shall not replenish
the reserve set forth in Section 12, within 3 business days of the request of the Holder; or 

(m) The Company shall not be  current 
in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; or 

(n)  The Company shall lose the
 bid  price for its stock in a market (including the OTCBB marketplace or other exchange) 

Then, or at any time thereafter, unless
cured within 5 days, and in each and every such case, unless such Event of Default shall have been waived in writing by the Holder
(which waiver shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent default) at the option of the Holder and in the Holder's sole
discretion, the Holder may consider this Note immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or (further) notice
of any kind (other than notice of acceleration), all of which are hereby expressly waived, anything herein or in any note or other
instruments contained to the contrary notwithstanding, and the Holder may immediately, and without expiration of any period of
grace, enforce any and all of the Holder's rights and remedies provided herein or any other rights or remedies afforded by law.
Upon an Event of Default, interest shall accrue at a default interest rate of 24% per annum or, if such rate is usurious or not
permitted by current law, then at the highest rate of interest permitted by law. In the event of a breach of Section 8(k) the penalty

8(n) shall be an increase of the outstanding principal amounts by 20%. In case of a breach of Section 8(i), the outstanding principal
due under this Note shall increase by 50%. Further, if a breach of Section 8(m) occurs or is continuing then the Holder shall be
entitled to use the lowest closing bid price during the delinquency period as a base price for the conversion. For example, if
the lowest closing bid price during the delinquency period is $0.01 per share and the conversion discount is 50% the Holder may
elect to convert future conversions at $0.005 per share. If this Note is not paid at maturity, the outstanding principal due under
this Note shall increase by 10%. 

Initials: JR   5       

If the Holder shall commence an action
or proceeding to enforce any provisions of this Note, including, without limitation, engaging an attorney, then if the Holder
prevails in such action, the Holder shall be reimbursed by the Company for its attorneys  fees and other costs and expenses
incurred in the investigation, preparation and prosecution of such action or proceeding.

At the Holder s election, if the Company fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder the conversion shares by the by the
3rd business day following the delivery of a Notice of Conversion to the Company and if the Holder incurs a Failure to Deliver
Loss, then at any time the Holder may provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect
of the Failure to Deliver Loss and the Company must make the Holder whole as follows: 

 Failure to Deliver Loss = [(High trade
price at any time on or after the day of exercise) x (Number of conversion shares)] 

The Company must pay the Failure to Deliver
Loss by cash payment, and any such cash payment must be made by the third business day from the time of the Holder s written
notice to the Company. 

9. In case any provision of this
Note is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be excessive in scope or otherwise invalid or unenforceable, such provision
shall be adjusted rather than voided, if possible, so that it is enforceable to the maximum extent possible, and the validity and
enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Note will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. 

10. Neither this Note nor any term
hereof may be amended, waived, discharged or terminated other than by a written instrument signed by the Company and the Holder. 

11. The Company represents that
it is not a  shell  issuer and has never been a  shell  issuer or that if it previously has been a  shell 
issuer that at least 12 months have passed since the Company has reported form 10 type information indicating it is no longer
a  shell issuer. Further. The Company will instruct its counsel to either (i) write a 144 opinion to allow for salability
of the conversion shares or (ii) accept such opinion from Holder s counsel.

agent instructions reserving 1,575,000,000 shares of its Common Stock for conversions under this Note (the  Share Reserve ).

associated with issuing and delivering the shares. If such amounts are to be paid by the Holder, it may deduct such amounts from
the Conversion Price. The company should at all times reserve a minimum of four times the amount of shares required if the note
would be fully converted.  The Holder may reasonably request increases from time to time to reserve such amounts. The Company
will instruct its transfer agent to provide the outstanding share information to the Holder in connection with its conversions.

Holder direct notice of any corporate actions, including but not limited to name changes, stock splits, recapitalizations etc.

Initials:  JR    5

or proceeding to enforce any provisions of this Note, including, without limitation, engaging an attorney, then if the Holder prevails
in such action, the Holder shall be reimbursed by the Company for its attorneys  fees and other costs and expenses incurred
in the investigation, preparation and prosecution of such action or proceeding.

Failure to Deliver Loss = [(High trade
price at any time on or after the day of exercise) x (Number of conversion shares)] 

The Company must pay the Failure to Deliver
Loss by cash payment, and any such cash payment must be made by the third business day from the time of the Holder s written
notice to the Company. 

9. In case any provision of this
Note is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be excessive in scope or otherwise invalid or unenforceable, such provision
shall be adjusted rather than voided, if possible, so that it is enforceable to the maximum extent possible, and the validity and
enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Note will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

hereof may be amended, waived, discharged or terminated other than by a written instrument signed by the Company and the Holder.

issuer that at least 12 months have passed since the Company has reported form 10 type information indicating it is no longer a
 shell issuer. Further. The Company will instruct its counsel to either (i) write a 144 opinion to allow for salability of
the conversion shares or (ii) accept such opinion from Holder s counsel. 

12. The
Company shall issue irrevocable transfer agent instructions reserving 21,000,000 shares of its Common Stock for conversions under
this Note (the  Share Reserve ). Upon full conversion of this Note, any shares remaining in the Share Reserve shall
be cancelled. The Company shall pay all costs associated with issuing and delivering the shares. If such amounts are to be paid
by the Holder, it may deduct such amounts from the Conversion Price. The company should at all times reserve a minimum of four
times the amount of shares required if the note would be fully converted.  The Holder may reasonably request increases from
time to time to reserve such amounts. The Company will instruct its transfer agent to provide the outstanding share information
to the Holder in connection with its conversions. 

Initials:  JR    6       

13. The Company will give the Holder
direct notice of any corporate actions, including but not limited to name changes, stock splits, recapitalizations etc. This notice
shall be given to the Holder as soon as possible under law. 

14. This Note shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of New York applicable to contracts made and wholly to be performed within the State
of New York and shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of each party hereto. The Holder and the Company hereby mutually
waive trial by jury and consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the courts of the State of New York. This Agreement may
be executed in counterparts, and the facsimile transmission of an executed counterpart to this Agreement shall be effective as
an original.
