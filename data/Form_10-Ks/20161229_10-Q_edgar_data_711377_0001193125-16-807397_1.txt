  NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)   
  1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION     The accompanying unaudited
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (generally accepted accounting principles) for interim financial information and with the instructions
to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all
adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The results of operations for the six month period ended November 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the
results to be expected for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2017. For more complete financial information, these consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the May 31, 2016 audited consolidated financial statements
and the notes thereto included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2016.     2. INVENTORIES

   4. SEGMENT INFORMATION   
 The Company has two reportable segments: Food Safety and Animal Safety. The Food Safety segment is primarily engaged in the development, production and
marketing of diagnostic test kits, dehydrated culture media and related products used by food producers and processors to detect harmful natural toxins, foodborne bacteria, allergens and levels of general sanitation. The Animal Safety segment is
primarily engaged in the development, production and marketing of products dedicated to animal safety, including a complete line of consumable products marketed to veterinarians and animal health product distributors; this segment also provides
genomic identification and related interpretive bioinformatic services. Additionally, the Animal Safety segment produces and markets rodenticides, disinfectants and insecticides to assist in the control of rodents, insects and disease in and around
agricultural, food production and other facilities.    These segments are managed separately because they represent strategic business units that offer
different products and require different marketing strategies. The Company evaluates performance based on total sales and operating income of the respective segments. The accounting policies of each of the segments are the same as those described in
Note 1.    Segment information follows:      

(1) 
 Includes corporate assets, consisting principally of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, current and deferred tax accounts and overhead expenses not allocated to specific business segments. Also includes
the elimination of intersegment transactions.

   5. EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS   
 Qualified and non-qualified options to purchase shares of common stock may be granted to directors, officers and employees of the Company under the terms of
the Company s stock option plans. These options are granted at an exercise price of not less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. Options vest ratably over three and five year periods and the contractual terms are
generally five or ten years. A summary of stock option activity during the six months ended November 30, 2016 follows:      
   During the three and six month periods ended November 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company recorded $1,218,000 and $1,248,000
and $2,734,000 and $2,545,000, respectively, of compensation expense related to its share based awards.    The weighted-average fair value per share of
stock options granted during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model was $15.79 and $13.11, respectively. The fair value of stock options granted was estimated using the following
weighted-average assumptions.      
   The Company has an employee stock purchase plan that provides for employee stock purchases at a 5% discount to market price.
The discount is recorded in administrative expense as of the date of purchase.     6. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   
 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The new standard outlines a single comprehensive model for
entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the revenue model is that an entity should
recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard is designed to create
greater comparability for financial statement users across industries and jurisdictions and also requires enhanced disclosures. In April 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-10  Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606), which amends and adds clarity to certain aspects of the guidance set forth in ASU 2014-09 related to identifying performance obligations and licensing. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years,
beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.  
 In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11 Inventory: Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. The update requires inventory not measured using
either the last in, first out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable
cost of completion, disposal and transportation. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of ASU 2015-11 on its consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

Table of Contents  

  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16 Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement - Period
Adjustments. Changes to the accounting for measurement-period adjustments relate to business combinations. Currently, an acquiring entity is required to retrospectively adjust the balance sheet amounts of the acquiree recognized at the acquisition
date with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill as a result of changes made to the balance sheet amounts of the acquiree. The measurement period is the period after the acquisition date during which the acquirer may adjust the balance sheet amounts
recognized for a business combination (generally up to one year from the date of acquisition). The changes eliminate the requirement to make such retrospective adjustments, and instead require the acquiring entity to record these adjustments in the
reporting period they are determined. The new standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company has adopted this standard, which does not have a material impact on its consolidated
financial condition and results of operations.    The FASB recently issued ASU No. 2015-17 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification
of Deferred Taxes as part of its Simplification Initiative. The amendments eliminate the guidance in Topic 740,  Income Taxes , that required an entity to separate deferred tax liabilities and assets between current and noncurrent amounts in a
classified balance sheet. Rather, deferred taxes will be presented as noncurrent under the new standard. This ASU is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017 for
public companies. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not believe that adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial condition.  
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 Leases to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets
and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset
representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed from previous U.S. GAAP. This ASU is
effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018. Modified retrospective application is permitted with certain practical expedients. Early adoption is permitted. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of ASU No. 2016-02 on its consolidated financial condition and results of operations.    In March 2016, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2016-09   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting to provide guidance that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. The
guidance requires the recognition of the income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled, thus eliminating additional paid-in capital pools. The guidance also allows for the employer to repurchase more of an
employee s shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting. In addition, the guidance allows for a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than on an estimated basis. This ASU is effective for
annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU No. 2016-09 on its consolidated financial
condition and results of operations.    In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments
(a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force). The amendments in ASU 2016-15 address eight specific cash flow issues and apply to all entities that are required to present a statement of cash flows under FASB Accounting Standards Codification
(FASB ASC) 230, Statement of Cash Flows. The amendments in ASU 2016-15 are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is
permitted, including adoption during an interim period. The Company has not yet adopted this update and is currently evaluating the impact of ASU No. 2016-15 on its consolidated financial statements.  
 In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16   Income Taxes (Topic 740), Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory which requires
companies to account for income tax effects of intercompany transactions other than inventory in the period in which the transfer occurs. This is a change from current GAAP, which requires companies to defer the income tax effects of intercompany
transfers of assets until the asset has been sold to an outside party or otherwise recognized (i.e. depreciation, amortization, impaired). ASU 2016-16 will still require companies to defer the income tax effects of intercompany inventory
transactions. The amendments of this ASU are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company has not yet adopted this update and is currently evaluating the impact of ASU
No. 2016-16 on its consolidated financial statements.

   7. BUSINESS AND PRODUCT LINE ACQUISITIONS   
 The Consolidated Statements of Income reflect the results of operations for business acquisitions since the respective dates of purchase. All are accounted for

 On August 26, 2015, the Company acquired all of the stock of Lab M Holdings, a developer, manufacturer and supplier of microbiological culture media and

$3,611,000 (with an estimated life of 5-15 years) and the remainder to goodwill (non-deductible for tax purposes). These values are Level 3 fair value measurements. This business continues to operate in its current location and reports within the
Food Safety segment.    On December 22, 2015, the Company acquired the rodenticide assets of Virbac Corporation, the North American affiliate of the
France-based Virbac group, a global animal health company. The acquired assets include a rodenticide active ingredient that complements Neogen s existing active ingredients, and more than 40 regulatory approvals for a variety of formulations in
the United States, Canada and Mexico. The acquired assets also include a large retail and OEM customer base. Consideration for the purchase was $3,525,000 in cash and up to $300,000 of contingent consideration. The preliminary purchase price
allocation included inventory of $317,000, property and equipment of $60,000, intangible assets of $2,545,000 (with an estimated life of 5-15 years) and the remainder to goodwill (deductible for tax purposes). These values are Level 3 fair value

 On April 26, 2016, the Company acquired the stock of Deoxi Biotecnologia Ltda., an animal genomics laboratory located in Aracatuba, Brazil. Deoxi was a
competitor of Neogen s in the livestock genomics market and this acquisition is intended to help accelerate the growth of Neogen s animal genomics services in Brazil. Consideration for the purchase was $1,549,000 in cash and up to
$2,552,000 of contingent consideration, due at the end of each of the first two years, based on an excess net sales formula. The final purchase price allocation, based upon the fair value of these assets and liabilities determined using the income
approach, included accounts receivable of $132,000, inventory of $89,000, other current assets of $9,000, property and equipment of $232,000, current liabilities of $266,000, contingent consideration liabilities of $453,000, non-amortizable

intangible assets of $350,000 (with an estimated life of 5-10 years) and the remainder to goodwill (deductible for tax purposes). These values are Level 3 fair value measurements. This business
continues to operate in its current location and reports within the Food Safety segment.    On May 1, 2016, the Company acquired the stock of Preserve
International and its sister company, Tetradyne LLC, manufacturers and marketers of cleaners, disinfectants and associated products to the swine, poultry, food processing and dairy markets. Preserve and Tetradyne have manufacturing locations in

cash. Due to the timing of the transaction, the preliminary purchase price allocation was not complete at the time of filing.    On December 27, 2016
subsequent to the end of the second quarter, Neogen completed the acquisition of the stock of Rogama Industria e Comercio, Ltda., a company that develops and manufactures rodenticides and insecticides, based near Sao Paulo, Brazil. Consideration for

  8. LONG TERM DEBT     The Company has a financing agreement
with a bank providing for an unsecured revolving line of credit, which was amended on November 30, 2016 to increase the line from $12,000,000 to $15,000,000, and extend the maturity from September 1, 2017 to September 30, 2019. There
were no advances against the line of credit during fiscal 2016 and there have been none thus far in fiscal 2017; there is no balance outstanding at November 30, 2016. Interest on any borrowings remained at LIBOR plus 100 basis points (rate
under the terms of the agreement was 1.77% at November 30, 2016). Financial covenants include maintaining specified levels of tangible net worth, debt service coverage, and funded debt to EBITDA, each of which the Company was in compliance with
at November 30, 2016.     9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   
 The Company is involved in environmental remediation and monitoring activities at its Randolph, Wisconsin manufacturing facility and accrues for related costs
when such costs are determined to be probable and estimable. The Company expenses annual costs of remediation, which have ranged from $47,000 to $57,000 per year over the past five years. The Company s estimated liability for these costs is
$916,000 at November 30, 2016 and May 31, 2016, measured on an undiscounted basis over an estimated period of 15 years; $60,000 of the liability is recorded within current liabilities and the remainder is recorded within other long-term
liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.    The Company is subject to certain legal and other proceedings in the normal course of business that, in
the opinion of management, should not have a material effect on its future results of operations or financial position.     10. STOCK PURCHASE   
 The Company has a stock repurchase program, authorized by the Board of Directors in calendar year 2008, to purchase, subject to market conditions, up to

  PART I   FINANCIAL INFORMATION  
    Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   
 The information in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains both historical financial
information and forward-looking statements. Neogen does not provide forecasts of future financial performance. While management is optimistic about the Company s long-term prospects, historical financial information may not be indicative of
future financial results.     Safe Harbor and Forward-Looking Statements   
 Forward-looking statements, within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, are made throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. For this purpose, any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements. Without limiting the
foregoing, the words  believes,   anticipates,   plans,   expects,   seeks,   estimates,  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. There are a number of
important factors, including competition, recruitment and dependence on key employees, impact of weather on agriculture and food production, identification and integration of acquisitions, research and development risks, patent and trade secret
protection, government regulation and other risks detailed from time to time in the Company s reports on file at the Securities and Exchange Commission, that could cause Neogen Corporation s results to differ materially from those
indicated by such forward-looking statements, including those detailed in this  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   
 In addition, any forward-looking statements represent management s views only as of the day this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q was first filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission and should not be relied upon as representing management s views as of any subsequent date. While management may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, it specifically
disclaims any obligation to do so, even if its views change.     Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   
 The discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements that have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the estimates, including, but not limited to, those related to receivable allowances, inventories, accruals,
goodwill and other intangible assets. These estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  
 There were no significant changes to our contractual obligations or contingent liabilities and commitments disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016.    There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in
the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016.

   Executive Overview   
 Revenues for the Company for the second quarter ended November 30, 2016 were $90.7 million, an increase of 14%, or $11.1 million, compared to revenues of
$79.6 million for the same period in the prior year. For the year to date period, revenues were $174.4 million, an increase of 13%, or $19.9 million, compared to revenues of $154.5 million in the first six months of fiscal 2016. Net income
attributable to Neogen for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 increased 23% to $11.2 million, or $0.29 per fully diluted share, compared to $9.1 million, or $0.24, in the second quarter of the prior fiscal year. For the first six months of the
current fiscal year, net income attributable to Neogen increased 14% to $21.0 million, or $0.55 per fully diluted share, compared to $18.4 million, or $0.49, in the same period in fiscal 2016.  
 For the three month period ended November 30, 2016, Food Safety revenues increased 9% and Animal Safety revenues increased 18%, each compared to the same
period in the prior year. For the quarter, the overall organic sales increase was 7%; organic growth in the Food Safety segment was 8% while the Animal Safety segment had organic growth of 5%. The acquisitions of Virbac (December 2015), Deoxi (April
2016) and Preserve/Tetradyne (May 2016) contributed $5.9 million to the overall revenue growth in the quarter. For the first six months of fiscal 2017, Food Safety revenues increased 11% and Animal Safety revenues increased 14%, each compared to the
same period in the prior fiscal year. Overall organic sales increased 5% for the year to date period; the organic increases were 9% for the Food Safety segment and 2% for the Animal Safety segment. Lab M (August 2015) and the previously mentioned
acquisitions contributed $12.1 million to the overall revenue growth in the first six months of fiscal 2017. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company lost the ability to sell its popular canine thyroid replacement product after the FDA
approved a new drug application for a competitor, which gave the competitor exclusive marketing rights to the product. The Company will be unable to sell this product, which had sales of $6.6 million for the full 2016 fiscal year, in the U.S. until
similar regulatory approval is granted; the Company does not expect that this approval will occur in the current fiscal year. Excluding the impact of the loss of revenues of this product and adverse currency translations, primarily due to the
devaluation of the pound sterling and the Mexican peso, overall organic sales growth would have been 11% for both the second quarter and year to date periods.  
 International sales were $31.2 million in the second quarter, an increase of 9% compared to the prior year. Expressed as a percentage of total sales,
international sales were 34.4% compared to 36.0% in the second quarter of the prior year. For the six month period, international sales were $60.3 million, an increase of 13%; international sales were 34.6% of total sales in the current year to date
period and 34.4% in the prior year. Currency translations had an adverse effect of approximately $2.1 million on international revenue in the second quarter and $4.0 million for the year to date.  
 Neogen Europe, based in Ayr, Scotland, recorded sales increases of 33% in its local currency, the pound sterling, in the second quarter; this increase was
reduced to 10% when these revenues were translated to U.S. dollars. For the six month period, revenues increased 38% in pound sterling, which was reduced to a 17% increase when translated to dollars. Strong sales of deoxynivalenol (DON) test kits,
due to outbreaks of contaminated corn crops in western Europe, and increases in genomics revenues resulting from the addition of an in-house genomics lab in Ayr, led the growth at the Company s European subsidiary for both the second quarter
and year to date periods.    Neogen do Brasil recorded an increase of 64% in its local currency, the real, in the second quarter. The Company benefitted
from favorable currency conditions as the real strengthened during the quarter, resulting in a 93% revenue increase when translated to U.S. dollars. For the year to date period, revenues increased 54% in local currency and 66% in dollars. For both
periods, the increase was led by sales of forensic test kits, sold to testing labs in Brazil for drug testing of commercial truck drivers, and sales of the Company s Acumedia line of dehydrated culture media as the subsidiary recorded market
share gains. The Company s Mexico-based subsidiary recorded an increase of 3% in its local currency, the peso, which was reduced to an 11% decrease when translated to U.S. dollars, for the second quarter. The peso declined 10% in early November
following the results of the U.S. presidential election. For the six month period, Neogen Latinoamerica sales increased 20% in pesos and 4% after translating to dollars. The lower 3% growth rate in the second quarter was primarily due to delays in
order timing for several customers.    Service revenue was $13.8 million for the quarter ended November 30, 2016, an increase of $2.9 million, or 26%,
compared to the same quarter in the prior year. For the year to date period, service revenue increased 21%, from $20.7 million in the prior year to $25.2 million in fiscal 2017. For both the second quarter and year to date periods, the growth was
led by increased genomics revenues, the result of additional business with a large customer in the poultry market, custom research work, and increased sales to the bovine market.  
 Gross margin was 48.1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to 48.0% in the same period a year ago. Favorable product mix in the quarter, led by
strong sales of DON test kits, forensic test kits and rodenticides, offset the lower margin impact of the recent Lab M and Preserve/Tetradyne acquisitions, the loss of the high margin thyroid replacement product and the negative impact of currency

translations. For the six-month period, gross margin was 48.2% compared to 49.2% in the prior year. On a year to date basis, the loss of the thyroid replacement product lowered gross margin by
approximately 60 basis points in the current year; adverse currency translations and product mix also negatively impacted gross margins.    Total operating
expenses increased 13% for both the quarter and year to date periods. Sales and marketing expense increased $1.5 million in the second quarter and $2.7 million for the six month period; each period represented a 10% increase over the same period in
the prior year. The largest increases for both the quarter and year to date were commissions, shipping and royalties, all of which are based on the revenue increase, and higher salaries, the result of increased staffing and compensation increases.
General and administrative expense increased $1.5 million in the quarter and $3.0 million for the year to date; each increased 22% compared to the same periods in the prior year. Recent acquisitions contributed $1.4 million of the increase year to
date, with half of that in the second quarter. Additional increases were for personnel related expenditures, and higher depreciation on information technology equipment and software. Research and development expense increased $150,000, or 6%, in the
second quarter and rose $254,000, or 5%, for the six months, and reflect continued investment in product improvement and development, primarily in the Food Safety segment.  
 Operating income was $16.9 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, an increase of 15%, from $14.6 million recorded in last year s second quarter.
Expressed as a percentage of revenue, operating income was 18.6%, compared to 18.4% for the same period in the prior year. The increase in operating margin was due to the slight improvement in gross margin and operating expenses that rose less than
the increase in revenues. For the six month period, operating income was $31.6 million, or 18.1% of sales, compared to $29.5 million, or 19.1% of sales, in the same period of the prior year. The decline in operating margin, as a percentage of
revenues, on a year to date basis is due to the decrease in gross margin percentage, which resulted from the loss of the thyroid replacement product, adverse currency translations and product mix.  
 Other expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was $81,000 compared to expense of $420,000 in the prior year. Currency loss of $424,000 was offset by
royalty income of $22,000 and interest income of $296,000. The increase in interest income for the quarter was due to interest received on funds on deposit in Brazil; the approximate annual interest rate in Brazil is 14%. In the second quarter of
the prior year, currency loss was $562,000, partially offset by interest income of $51,000 and royalty income of $67,000. For the first six months of fiscal 2017, other income was $412,000, comprised primarily of interest income of $420,000 and
royalty income of $67,000, offset by currency loss of $178,000. For the year to date period in the prior year, other expense of $876,000 includes currency loss of $1,167,000, interest income of $119,000 and royalty income of $109,000.  
 The Company s effective tax rate in the second quarter was 33.4% compared to 35.6% in the prior year. The current year provision includes a tax credit
for research and development; this was not recorded in last year s second quarter as the credit had not yet been approved by the U.S. Congress. For the year to date period, the effective tax rate was 34.1% compared to 35.6% in the prior year.
Net income attributable to Neogen increased $2.1 million, or 23%, for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and $2.6 million, or 14%, for the six month period, each compared to the same period in the prior year.

   Revenues       
   The Company s Food Safety segment revenues were $40.8 million in the quarter ended November 30, 2016, an increase of
9% compared to the same period in the prior year. For the six month period, Food Safety revenues increased 11% to $79.8 million. Organic growth for the segment was 8% for the quarter and 9% for the year to date period, with the acquisitions of Lab M
on August 26, 2015 and Deoxi on April 26, 2016 contributing the remainder of growth. Adverse currency translations, resulting from the strength of the U.S. dollar, reduced both overall segment growth and organic growth for both periods. In
a neutral currency environment, Food Safety growth was 15% for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, with organic growth of 14%; year to date, the overall increase was 17% and organic growth was 14%.  
 Natural Toxins, Allergens   Drug Residues sales increased 16% in the second quarter and 12% for the first six months of fiscal 2017. For the second
quarter, sales of natural toxins increased 27%, led by sales of DON test kits and related equipment due to outbreaks of DON in corn crops in the Midwest U.S., Canada and Europe; overall sales of this product line have risen 14% for the year to date
period. Allergen  
      16  

Table of Contents  

test kit revenues rose 20% in the quarter and 18% for the six month period, as increased consumer awareness and recalls relating to allergenic contamination of food continues to expand the
market. Sales of test kits to detect the presence of drug residues, primarily in dairy milk, were down 8% in the quarter, due in large part to order timing from a large distributor and market losses in Europe; sales of these kits were flat for the
year to date period.    Sales of Bacterial   General Sanitation products decreased 1% in the second quarter but rose 3% for the year to date. For
the quarter, sales of  Salmonella  test kits increased 18%; this increase was offset by a 24% decline in sales of  Listeria  test kits, due to a research project in the prior year which did not recur, and an 18% decrease in sales of
Soleris and BioLumix equipment, due to difficult comparisons to a strong prior year quarter. For the six month period, sales of  Salmonella  test kits increased 14% and the Company s AccuPoint sanitation monitoring product line rose 5%,
while  Listeria  test kit sales recorded an 8% decline.    Dehydrated Culture Media   Other increased 8% in the second quarter and 17% for the
year to date period, each compared to the same periods a year ago, aided in part by the acquisitions of Lab M and Deoxi. Organic growth was 4% and 8% for the quarter and year to date periods, respectively. Genomics revenue, which is reported in the
Other category in the Food Safety segment, increased 70% for the quarter and 78% for the six months, due primarily to the transfer of certain genomics revenues from GeneSeek to Neogen Europe as the Ayr, Scotland based operation added genomics
testing capabilities to better serve the growing European market. Partially offsetting this was a 15% decrease in sales of the Company s Acumedia line of dehydrated culture media sold into traditional domestic media markets; the prior year had
strong sales resulting from a customer s research project which did not recur; this resulted in a 28% decline for the six month period.    The
Company s Animal Safety segment revenues were $50.0 million, an increase of 18% compared to the same quarter in the prior year. Organic growth for the segment was 5% for the quarter and 2% for the year to date period, with the acquisitions of
Virbac on December 22, 2015 and Preserve/Tetradyne on May 1, 2016 contributing the remainder of growth. Revenues for the six month period increased 14% to $94.6 million from $82.8 million in the prior year. Excluding the loss of the
previously discussed thyroid replacement product, this segment had overall organic growth of 9% for the second quarter and 7% for the year to date period. Currency translations had minimal effect on revenues in this segment.  
 Life Sciences sales increased 36% for the second quarter and 35% for the year to date period, each compared to the prior year, the result of increased volume
from testing labs to meet new requirements for drug testing of commercial truck drivers in Brazil. Sales of Veterinary Instruments   Disposables products were down 7% for the quarter and 6% for the year to date. In the second quarter,
decreases in disposable syringes, which had increased sales in the prior year due to a competitor s backorder situation, and marking products were partially offset by a 19% increase in detectable needles, with particularly strong sales to
international customers.    Animal Care   Other sales decreased 14% in the quarter ended November 30, 2016 and year to date sales decreased
13%. The decrease is due to the loss of the ability to sell the Company s popular thyroid replacement product; the decrease was $1.4 million in the second quarter and $4.4 million for the first six months of the fiscal year. Partially
offsetting this decline was an increase in sales of vitamin injectables due to a marketing program in the second quarter.    Rodenticides,
Insecticides   Disinfectants sales increased 60% in the second quarter and 47% for the six month period, each compared to the same periods in the prior year. Organic growth in this category was 14% for the quarter and 6% for the year to
date. In the second quarter, the Preserve/Tetradyne acquisition added $5.2 million of cleaner and disinfectant sales, primarily to domestic swine, poultry, dairy and food processing markets; year to date sales were $9.7 million. Rodenticide sales
increased 16% for both the three and six month periods, led by incremental revenues from contract manufacturing agreements and continued penetration of the retail agricultural market, and partially offset by a decline in sales to the northwest U.S.
resulting from strong sales in the prior year due to a rodent outbreak which moderated in the current year. Cleaner and disinfectant sales increased 13% on an organic basis for the quarter, led by increases in international markets; year to date
sales are down 7% due primarily to weak demand in international markets in the first quarter. Chem-Tech revenues increased 22% in the quarter and 7% for the six months due to timing of distributor orders of insecticides.  
 DNA Testing revenues reported within the Animal Safety segment increased 24% in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and were up 17% for the six month period.
The increase for the quarter was due to significant research projects with two universities and continued new business with a large customer in the poultry market. In the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company began processing genomic samples at
its Neogen Europe location after expanding its genomic laboratory capabilities. Neogen Europe reports through the Food Safety segment and recorded approximately $800,000 of revenues in each of the first two quarters that would have been reported
through this product line in the prior year. Overall, DNA testing revenues rose 31% worldwide in the quarter and 26% year to date compared to the same periods last year.

   Financial Condition and Liquidity   
 The overall cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities position of the Company was $142.1 million at November 30, 2016, compared to $107.8 million
at May 31, 2016. Approximately $29.5 million was generated from operations during the first six months of fiscal 2017. Net cash proceeds of $10.3 million were realized from the exercise of stock options and issuance of shares under the
Company s employee stock purchase plan during the same period. The Company spent $6.2 million for property, equipment and other non-current assets in the first half of fiscal 2017.  
 Accounts receivable balances were $64.9 million at November 30, 2016, a decline of $2.8 million, or 4%, compared to $67.7 million at May 31, 2016.
Average days  sales outstanding was 63 days at November 30, 2016, compared to 61 days at May 31, 2016. Inventory levels rose by $7.3 million, or 11%, compared to May 31, 2016. The increase is due primarily to the timing of
receipts of orders and planned increases in stocking levels of identified key products to ensure availability and improve service levels.    Inflation and
changing prices are not expected to have a material effect on operations, as management believes it will continue to be successful in offsetting increased input costs with price increases and/or cost efficiencies.  
 Management believes that the Company s existing cash and marketable securities balances at November 30, 2016, along with available borrowings under
its credit facility and cash expected to be generated from future operations, will be sufficient to fund activities for the foreseeable future. However, existing cash and borrowing capacity may not be sufficient to meet the Company s cash
requirements to commercialize products currently under development or its plans to acquire other organizations, technologies or products that fit within the Company s mission statement. Accordingly, the Company may choose to issue equity
securities or enter into other financing arrangements for a portion of its future financing needs.

   PART I   FINANCIAL INFORMATION   
    Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   
 The Company has interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk exposure but no long-term fixed rate investments or borrowings. The Company s primary
interest rate risk is due to potential fluctuations of interest rates for variable rate borrowings (no borrowings at November 30, 2016) and short-term investments.  
 Foreign exchange risk exposure arises because the Company markets and sells its products throughout the world. Revenues in certain foreign countries as well
as certain expenses related to those revenues are transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company s operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the British pound sterling, the euro,
the Mexican peso, the Brazilian real, the Chinese yuan, and to a lesser extent, the Indian rupee and the Canadian dollar. When the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the dollar value of revenues denominated in foreign currencies
increases. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, the opposite situation occurs. Additionally, previously recognized revenues in the course of collection can be affected positively or negatively by changes in exchange rates. The Company uses derivative
financial instruments to help manage the economic impact of fluctuations in certain currency exchange rates. These contracts are adjusted to fair value through earnings.  
 Neogen has assets, liabilities and operations outside of the United States, located in Scotland, England, Brazil, Mexico, China, India, and Canada where the
functional currency is the British pound sterling, Brazilian real, Mexican peso, Chinese yuan, Indian rupee and Canadian dollar, respectively, and also transacts business throughout Europe in the euro. The Company s investments in foreign
subsidiaries are considered to be long-term.     PART I   FINANCIAL INFORMATION   
    Item 4. Controls and Procedures   
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures     An
evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of November 30, 2016 was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management,
including the Chairman   Chief Executive Officer and the Vice President   Chief Financial Officer ( the Certifying Officers ). Based on the evaluation, the Certifying Officers concluded that the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures are effective.     Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting   
 No changes in our control over financial reporting were identified as having occurred during the quarter ended November 30, 2016 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.
