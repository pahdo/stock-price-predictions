1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

NATURE OF BUSINESS   Incorporated on August 1, 2008, under the Laws of Republic of the Marshall Islands, Gener8 Maritime, Inc. (formerly named General Maritime Corporation) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the  Company ) provide international transportation services of seaborne crude oil and petroleum products. The Company s owned fleet at September 30, 2016 consisted of 37 tankers in operation (20 Very Large Crude Carriers ( VLCCs ), 11 Suezmax tankers, four Aframax tankers, two Panamax tankers), and six newbuilding VLCCs under construction. The Company operates its business in one business segment, which is the transportation of international seaborne crude oil and petroleum products. 

On May 7, 2015, the Company consummated a merger ( 2015 merger ) pursuant to an agreement between Gener8 Maritime Acquisition, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, Navig8 Crude Tankers, Inc. and the equity holders  representatives named therein. As a result of the merger, Gener8 Maritime Subsidiary Inc. (formerly known as Navig8 Crude Tankers, Inc.) became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and the Company s name was changed from General Maritime Corporation to Gener8 Maritime, Inc. The Company followed the guidance of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 805,   Business Combinations  . Pursuant to this, the Company accounted for the 2015 merger as an asset acquisition. For more details see   Note 6, 2015 MERGER  , in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The Company s vessels are primarily available for employment in commercial pools, or for charter on a spot voyage or time charter basis.  

The Company is party to certain commercial pooling arrangements. Commercial pools are designed to provide for effective chartering and commercial management of similar vessels that are combined into a single fleet to improve customer service, increase vessel utilization and capture cost efficiencies. 

The Company employs all of its VLCC, Suezmax and Aframax vessels in Navig8 Group commercial crude tanker pools including the VL8 Pool, the Suez8 Pool and the V8 Pool. In 2015, the Company s VLCC, Suezmax, Aframax and newbuilding owning subsidiaries entered into pool agreements with the pool managers VL8 Pool Inc. and V8 Pool Inc., subsidiaries of Navig8 Limited, the beneficial owner of over 4% of the Company s outstanding common shares as of September 30, 2016. See   Note 14,   Related Party Transactions  , for a description of the pool arrangements with these related parties.  

BASIS OF PRESENTATION   The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for interim financial information. In the opinion of management of the Company, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and operating results, have been included in the financial statements. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, which provides a more complete understanding of our accounting policies. The results of operations for the current and prior periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year. The financial statements of the Company have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting and presented in United States Dollars (USD or $) which is the functional currency of the Company. A summary of the significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the accompanying unaudited interim financial statements, which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, were included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except for the following new policies presented below, all accounting policies remained unchanged.  

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT   The Company is exposed to interest rate risk through its variable rate credit facilities. The Company uses interest rate swaps, under which the Company pays a fixed rate in exchange for receiving a variable rate, to achieve a fixed rate of interest on the hedged portion of its debt in order to increase the ability of the Company to forecast interest expense. The objective of these swaps is to help to protect the Company   

9 

Table of Contents  

against changes in borrowing rates on the current credit facilities and any replacement floating rate LIBOR credit facility. Upon execution of the swaps, the Company designated the hedges as cash flow hedges of benchmark interest rate risk under FASB ASC 815,   Derivatives and Hedging  , and the Company has established effectiveness testing and measurement processes. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded as assets or liabilities, and effective gains/losses are captured in a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ( OCI ) until reclassified to interest expense when the hedged variable rate interest expenses are incurred. The Company elected to classify settlement payments as operating activities within the statement of cash flow. See   Note 11,   Financial Instruments  , additional disclosures on the Company s interest rate swaps. 

GOODWILL   We follow the provisions of FASB ASC 350-20-35, Intangibles   Goodwill and Other  . This statement requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be tested for impairment at least annually or when there is a triggering event and written down with a charge to operations when the carrying amount of the reporting unit that includes goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the reporting unit s implied goodwill, such excess must be written off. Change in vessel values between November 30, 2015, the Company s last annual impairment test date, and September 30, 2016, indicated circumstances changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of each reporting unit below its carrying amount. At September 30, 2016 and in accordance with ASC 350-20-35, the Company considered the continued decline in the fair value of the Company s fleet independent valuations to be an indicator for goodwill impairment testing at the interim period. Accordingly, at September 30, 2016, goodwill was tested for potential impairment. As a result of the goodwill impairment test performed, it was determined that the carrying value for each reporting unit was higher than its fair value and therefore goodwill was fully impaired, which resulted in a write-off at September 30, 2016 of $23.3 million. Additionally, during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a $3.0 million goodwill write-off associated with the sale of the   Genmar Victory   and   Genmar Vision  , which were sold in August 2016. 

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   In April 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-10   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  . ASU No. 2016-10 suggests guidance for stakeholders on identifying performance obligations and licenses in customer contracts. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014 09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014 09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein, and shall be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of this standard update on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosure.  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  . This update affects all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees, and involves several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liability and classification on the statement of cash flows. An entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of adoption on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosure. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases  . ASU 2016-02 is intended to increase the transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. In order to meet that objective, the new standard requires recognition of the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. A lessee will be required to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. The new standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that adopting this standard will have on its financial statements and related disclosures.

Table of Contents  

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13-  Financial Instruments-Credit Losses   (Topic 326):   Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  . The amendments in this ASU require the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets, which include trade receivables, held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The guidance in this ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating this ASU and any potential impacts the adoption of this ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements revised guidance for the accounting and reporting of financial instruments. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15-  Statement of Cash Flows   (Topic 230):   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  . The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Entities must apply the guidance retrospectively to all periods presented but may apply it prospectively from the earliest date practicable if retrospective application would be impracticable. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that adopting this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

2. CASH FLOW INFORMATION 

The Company excluded from cash flows from investing and financing activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows items included in accounts payable and accrued expenses for accrued milestone and supervision payments of $9.6 million and $106.0 million for the period ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Capitalized interest amounted to $24.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, of which $8.8 million has not been paid out as of September 30, 2016 (which is included in long term debt in the condensed consolidated balance sheet). Capitalized interest amounted to $23.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

3. INCOME / (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE 

The computation of basic income / (loss) per share is based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted earnings / (loss) per share assumes the exercise of all dilutive stock options using the treasury stock method and the lapsing of restrictions on unvested restricted stock awards, for which the assumed proceeds upon lapsing the restrictions are deemed to be the amount of compensation cost attributable to future services and not yet recognized using the treasury stock method, to the extent dilutive. 

The reconciliation of basic to diluted income / (loss) per common share was as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts): 

On May 7, 2015, all shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock were converted on a one-to-one basis to a single class of common stock. As a result of the conversion in 2015, and since both Class A Common   

11 

Table of Contents  

Stock and Class B Common Stock had equal rights to earnings and losses, the 2016 and 2015 presentations of net income per share combine Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock and new common stock. Options to purchase 343,662 shares of Class A Common Stock were excluded from the above calculation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, because the impact is anti-dilutive. Options to purchase 309,296 shares of common stock were excluded from the above calculation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, because the impact is anti-dilutive. Warrants to purchase 1,431,520 shares (1,600,000 warrants converted at 0.8947 shares) of common stock were excluded from the above calculation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, because the warrant agreement expired on March 31, 2016. Options to purchase 13,420 shares of common stock were also excluded from the above calculation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, because certain market conditions have not been met.  

Additionally, on June 24, 2015, in connection with the pricing of the Company s IPO, the Company granted members of management restricted stock units ( RSUs ) of the Company s common stock pursuant to the Company s amended 2012 Equity Incentive Plan. The remaining RSUs will generally vest in tranches on December 1, 2016, December 1, 2017 and December 1, 2018, subject for each increment to employment with the Company through the applicable vesting date for such increment.  

On September 9, 2016 ( Grant Date ), in accordance with the Company s amended 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, the Company granted certain non-employee directors RSUs. The RSUs will generally vest on the earlier of (a) the date of the Company s next annual meeting of shareholders and (b) the first anniversary of the Grant Date, subject to the director s continued service with the Company through the applicable vesting date.  

The RSUs granted in June 2015 and September 2016 were excluded in determining the diluted net income / (loss) per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, because the impact is anti-dilutive. 

4. DELIVERY AND DISPOSAL OF VESSELS 

Delivery of Vessels 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company took delivery of the following 2016-built VLCC newbuildings. Upon delivery, all of these vessels entered into the VL8 Pool. The Company has made all shipyard installment payments, and there is no outstanding payable balance in respect of each vessel.  

(1) 

Amounts reflect the borrowings incurred under the   Korean Export Credit Facility or the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility   to fund the delivery of the indicated newbuilding. For more information see   Note 10, LONG-TERM DEBT  .

On August 8, 2016 the Company entered into an agreement for the sale of the 2001-built VLCC tanker   Genmar Victory   for $29.0 million, gross proceeds. On August 25, 2016 the sale was finalized and the Company recorded a net loss of $7.3 million, which is included in Loss on vessel disposal, net on the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The Company used the net proceeds to repay $19.4 million of the related portion of the senior secured debt outstanding under the Refinancing Facility associated with the vessel.  

5. PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS 

Prepaid expenses and other current assets consist of the following (dollars in thousands): 

The escrow deposit amount represents the loan proceeds due to the Company upon delivery of the   Gener8 Apollo  , which were received upon delivery of the vessel in January 2016. Insurance claims receivable consists substantially of payments made by the Company for repairs of vessels that the Company expects, pursuant to the terms of the insurance agreements, to recover from the carrier within one year, net of deductibles which have been expensed. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the portion of insurance claims receivable not expected to be collected within one year of $0.5 million and $0.8 million, respectively, is included in Other assets (non-current) on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Other primarily represents advances to our third party technical managers. 

6. VESSELS UNDER CONSTRUCTION 

Vessels under construction represents the cost of acquiring contracts to build vessels, installments paid to shipyards, certain other payments made to third parties and interest costs incurred during the construction of vessels (until the vessel is substantially complete and ready for its intended use). 

13 

Table of Contents  

Vessels under construction consist of the following (dollars in thousands): 

In March 2014, the Company   acquired seven newbuilding contracts for VLCC tankers   from Scorpio Tankers Inc. (  the  2014 Acquired VLCC Newbuildings ) in a stock purchase transaction ( SPV Stock Purchase ). Additionally,    the Company acquired 14 newbuilding contracts for VLCC tankers from Navig8 Crude in connection with the 2015 merger (the  2015 Acquired VLCC Newbuildings,  and   together with the 2014 Acquired VLCC Newbuildings, the  Acquired VLCC Newbuildings ).  

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and in accordance with its newbuilding contract, the Company took delivery of   Gener8 Oceanus  , the last of the 2014 Acquired VLCC Newbuildings to be delivered. See   Note 4, DELIVERY AND DISPOSAL OF VESSELS  , for deliveries during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and in accordance with their newbuilding contracts, three of the 2015 Acquired VLCC Newbuildings were delivered to the Company. See   Note 4, DELIVERY AND DISPOSAL OF VESSELS  , for deliveries during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, six additional 2015 Acquired VLCC Newbuildings are scheduled to be delivered during the remaining period of 2016 and early 2017. 

7. GOODWILL 

FASB ASC 350-20-35 provides guidance for impairment testing of goodwill, which is not amortized. Other than goodwill, the Company does not have any other intangible assets that are not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment using a two-step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the Company s reporting units. The first step is a screen for potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of impairment, if any. The first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered unimpaired.

Conversely, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of its existing assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. The unallocated portion of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss, equivalent to the difference, is recorded as a reduction of goodwill and a charge to operating expense. 

Change in vessel values between November 30, 2015, the Company s last annual impairment test date, and September 30, 2016, indicated circumstances changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of each reporting unit below its carrying amount. At September 30, 2016 and in accordance with ASC 350-20-35, the Company considered the continued decline in the fair value of the Company s fleet independent valuations to be an indicators for goodwill impairment testing as of September 30, 2016. Accordingly, at September 30, 2016, goodwill was tested for potential impairment. As a result of the goodwill impairment test performed, it was determined that the carrying value for each reporting unit was higher than its fair value and therefore goodwill was fully impaired, which resulted in a write-off at September 30, 2016 of $23.3 million. Additionally, during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a $3.0 million goodwill write-off associated with the sales of   Genmar Victory   and   Genmar Vision  , which were sold in August 2016. 

8. OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS  

Other non-current assets consist of the following (dollars in thousands):

10. LONG TERM DEBT 

Long term debt consists of the following (dollars in thousands): 

Unamortized discount and debt financing cost include an unamortized discount related to the Company s Senior Notes and deferred financing costs comprised of bank fees and legal expenses associated with securing new loan facilities. These deferred financing costs are amortized based upon the effective interest rate method over the life of the related debt, which is included in interest expense.  

As of September 30, 2016, the Company has an aggregate amount of up to approximately $385.0 million of available borrowings under the Korean Export Credit Facility and the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility (subject to borrowing limits and other conditions set forth in the applicable senior secured credit facilities) for the purpose of financing future deliveries of VLCC newbuilding vessels with remaining installment payments of $307.4 million, of which $211.6 million and $95.8 million are due in the remaining period of 2016 and 2017, respectively. 

On June 29, 2016, the Company amended the Sinosure Credit Facility for the purpose of financing the delivery of two VLCC newbuilding vessels, the   Gener8 Chiotis   and the   Gener8 Miltiades  .   

The Sinosure Credit Facility, as amended by the Amending Deed (the  Amended Sinosure Facility ), provides for term loans up to the aggregate amount of approximately $385.2 million (subject to borrowing limits and other conditions set forth in the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility). All other terms of the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility remain substantially similar in all material respects to those in the Sinosure Credit Facility prior to giving effect to the Amending Deed. See  Amended Sinosure Credit Facility  below for further information regarding the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility. 

On May 2, 2016, the Company entered into interest rate swap transactions, which are intended to be cash flow hedges that effectively fix the interest rates for the Refinancing Facility, the Korean Export Credit Facility and the Sinosure Credit Facility. The interest rate swap transactions were each confirmed under an ISDA Master Agreement, as published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Associations, Inc. ( ISDA ), including the Schedule thereto and related documentation containing customary representations, warranties and covenants. The Company may modify or terminate any of the foregoing interest rate swap transactions in accordance with their terms or enter into additional swap transactions in the future from time to time. Notwithstanding the terms of the interest rate swap transactions, the Company remains ultimately obligated for all amounts due and payable under the credit facilities in accordance with the terms thereof. See   Note 11,   Financial InstrumentS  , for more details. 

Refinancing Facility 

On September 3, 2015, the Company entered into a term loan facility (the  Refinancing Facility ) to refinance its former senior secured credit facilities. The Refinancing Facility provides for term loans up to the aggregate approximate amount of $581.0 million, which have been fully drawn. The loans under the Refinancing Facility will mature on September 3, 2020. The Refinancing Facility bears interest at a rate per annum based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus a margin of 3.75% per annum. If there is a failure to pay any amount due on a loan under the Refinancing Facility and related credit documents, interest shall accrue at a rate 2.00% higher than the interest rate

that would otherwise have been applied to such amount. See   Note 11, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  , for the Company s interest rate risk management program related to the credit facility.  

The Company is obligated to repay the Refinancing Facility in 20 consecutive quarterly installments which commenced on September 3, 2015. The Company is also required to prepay the Refinancing Facility upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the sale of a vessel held as collateral or total loss of a vessel. 

Korean Export Credit Facility 

On September 3, 2015, the Company entered into a term loan facility (the  Korean Export Credit Facility ) to fund a portion of the remaining installment payments due under shipbuilding contracts in respect of 15 of the Acquired VLCC Newbuildings being built at Korean shipyards. As of September 30, 2016, the Korean Export Credit Facility funded the delivery of 10 of these newbuildings. 

The Korean Export Credit Facility provides for term loans up to the aggregate approximate amount of $963.7 million, which is comprised of a tranche of term loans to be made available by a syndicate of commercial lenders up to the aggregate approximate amount of $282.0 million (the  Commercial Tranche ), a tranche of term loans to be fully guaranteed by the Export-Import Bank of Korea ( KEXIM ) up to the aggregate approximate amount of $139.7 million (the  KEXIM Guaranteed Tranche ), a tranche of term loans to be made available by KEXIM up to the aggregate approximate amount of $197.4 million (the  KEXIM Funded Tranche ) and a tranche of term loans insured by Korea Trade Insurance Corporation ( K-Sure ) up to the aggregate approximate amount of $344.6 million (the  K-Sure Tranche ).  

Borrowings under each term loan will be available to be incurred at or around the time of delivery of each VLCC newbuilding funded by the Korean Export Credit Facility in an amount equal to the lowest of (i) 65% of the final contract price of such VLCC newbuilding, (ii) 65% of the maximum contract price of such VLCC newbuilding and (iii) 60% of the fair market value of such VLCC newbuilding tested at or around the time of delivery of such VLCC newbuilding. The Company s ability to utilize these funds is subject to the actual delivery of the vessel and other borrowing conditions. Each loan will mature, in respect of the Commercial Tranche, on the date falling 60 months from the date of borrowing of that loan and, in respect of the other tranches, on the date falling 144 months from the date of borrowing of that loan. 

The Korean Export Credit Facility bears interest at a rate per annum based on LIBOR plus a margin of, in relation to the Commercial Tranche, 2.75% per annum, in relation to the KEXIM Guaranteed Tranche, 1.50% per annum, in relation to the KEXIM Funded Tranche, 2.60% per annum and in relation to the K-Sure Tranche, 1.70% per annum. If there is a failure to pay any amount due, interest shall accrue at a rate 2.00% higher than the interest rate that would otherwise have been applied to such amount. See   Note 11, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  , for the Company s interest rate risk management program related to the credit facility. 

The Company is obligated to repay the Commercial Tranche of each loan in 20 equal consecutive quarterly installments (excluding a final balloon payment equal to 2/3 of the applicable loan) of such loan and is obligated to repay the other tranches of each loan in 48 equal consecutive quarterly installments. The Company is also required to prepay the loans upon the occurrence of certain events, including a default under a shipbuilding contract, a sale or total loss of a vessel, and upon election by the majority lenders, upon a change of control of the Company. 

On October 20, 2016, the Company amended the Korean Export Credit Facility to modify the change of control 

provision in this credit facility to conform to the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility. Pursuant to this amendment, a change of control will occur if, at any time, none of (i) Peter Georgiopoulos, (ii) Gary Brocklesby or (iii) Nicolas Busch serves as a member of the Company s board of directors. 

Amended Sinosure Credit Facility 

On December 1, 2015, the Company entered into a term loan facility (the  Sinosure Credit Facility ) to fund a portion of the installment payments due under shipbuilding contracts in respect of three VLCC newbuildings which are being built at Chinese shipyards and to refinance a credit facility.

As of September 30, 2016, the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility funded the delivery of four VLCC newbuildings and refinanced a credit facility. The Amended Sinosure Credit Facility provides for term loans up to the aggregate amount of approximately $385.2 million (subject to borrowing limits and other conditions set forth in the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility). 

Borrowings under each term loan will be available to be incurred at or around the time of delivery of each newbuilding funded by the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility in an amount equal to the lowest of (i) 67.5% of the contract price of such VLCC newbuilding, (ii) 67.5% of the maximum contract price of such VLCC newbuilding and (iii) 65% of the fair market value of such VLCC newbuilding tested at or around the time of delivery of such VLCC newbuilding. The Company s ability to utilize these funds is subject to the actual delivery of the vessel and other borrowing conditions. Each loan will mature on the date falling 144 months from the date of borrowing of that loan. 

The Amended Sinosure Credit Facility bears interest at a rate per annum based on LIBOR plus a margin of 2.00% per annum. If there is a failure to pay any amount due on a loan, interest shall accrue at a rate 2.00% higher than the interest rate that would otherwise have been applied to such amount. See   Note 11, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  , for the Company s interest rate risk management program related to the credit facility. 

The Company is obligated to repay each loan under the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility in equal consecutive quarterly installments (excluding a final balloon payment equal to 20% of the applicable loan), each in an amount equal to 1 2/3% of such loan, on each of March 21, June 21, September 21 and December 21 until the loan s maturity date. On the respective maturity date, the Company is obligated to repay the remaining amount that is outstanding under each loan. The Company is also required to prepay the loans upon the occurrence of certain events, including a default under a shipbuilding contract, a sale or total loss of a vessel and, upon election by The Export-Import Bank of China and one other lender, upon a change of control of the Company. 

Senior Notes 

On March 28, 2014, the Company and Gener8 Maritime Sub V entered into a note and guarantee agreement (the  Note and Guarantee Agreement ), with affiliates of BlueMountain Capital Management, LLC, in respect of the Company s issuance of senior unsecured notes due 2020 (the  Senior Notes ). On May 13, 2014, the Company issued the Senior Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $131.6 million for proceeds of approximately $125 million (before fees and expenses), after giving effect to the original issue discount provided for in the Note and Guarantee Agreement. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the discount on the Senior Notes was $5.1 million and $5.7 million, respectively, which the Company amortizes as additional interest expense until March 28, 2020. 

Interest on the Senior Notes accrues at the rate of 11.0% per annum in the form of additional Senior Notes and the balloon repayment is due 2020, except that if the Company at any time irrevocably elects to pay interest in cash for the remainder of the life of the Senior Notes, interest on the Senior Notes will thereafter accrue at the rate of 10.0% per annum.

Financial Covenants 

Under the Refinancing Facility, the Korean Export Credit Facility and the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility, the Company is required to comply with various collateral maintenance and financial covenants, including with respect to its maximum leverage ratio, minimum cash balance and an interest expense coverage ratio covenant. The lenders also require the Company to comply with a number of customary covenants, including covenants related to the delivery of quarterly and annual financial statements, budgets and annual projections; maintaining required insurances; compliance with laws (including environmental); maintenance of flag and class of the collateral vessels; restrictions on consolidations, mergers or sales of assets; limitations on liens; limitations on issuance of certain equity interests; limitations on restricted payments; limitations on transactions with affiliates; and other customary covenants and related provisions. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants that were in effect on such date. 

The Refinancing Facility, the Korean Export Credit Facility and the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility also contain certain restrictions on payments of dividends and prepayments of the indebtedness under the Note and Guarantee Agreement. The Refinancing Facility, the Korean Export Credit Facility and the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility permit the Company to pay dividends and make prepayments under the Note and Guarantee Agreement so long as the Company satisfies certain conditions under these facilities  minimum cash balance and collateral maintenance tests subject to a limit of 50% of consolidated net income earned by the Company after the date of the respective facility. For purposes of calculating consolidated net income, consolidated net income will be adjusted, without duplication, by adding noncash interest expense and amortization of other fees and expenses; amounts attributable to impairment charges on intangible assets, including amortization of goodwill; non-cash management retention or incentive program payments; non-cash restricted stock compensation; and losses on minority interests or investments less gains on such minority interests or investments. The Company is also permitted to pay dividends in an amount not to exceed net cash proceeds received from its issuance of equity after the date of the respective facility. It may also make prepayments under the Note and Guarantee Agreement from the proceeds received from sale of assets so long as it satisfies certain conditions under its minimum cash balance and collateral maintenance tests. Further, the Company is allowed to refinance the Note and Guarantee Agreement subject to certain restrictions and repay the outstanding indebtedness under the Note and Guarantee Agreement on the maturity date of the Note and Guarantee Agreement. 

Under the Note and Guarantee Agreement, the Company is permitted to make dividend payments if, after giving effect to the dividends, the ratio of the Company s secured indebtedness minus its cash to the Company s aggregate fair market value of all of its vessels is less than 60%, and the Company satisfies certain conditions under the Note and Guarantee Agreement s cumulative consolidated net income and net cash proceeds tests. In addition, in order

Interest Rate Risk Management 

On May 2, 2016, certain of the Company s wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into six pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swap agreements having amortizing notional amounts to hedge a portion of the   London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR )   floating rate interest expense on the Company s credit facilities as discussed in   Note 10, LONG TERM DEBT  .    Under each interest rate swap transaction, a subsidiary of the Company makes a fixed payment each period in an amount equal to the fixed interest rate for such transaction multiplied by the relevant notional amount for that monthly period in exchange for a payment from the respective swap counterparty in an amount equal to a variable interest rate based on the applicable LIBOR rate for that period multiplied by the same notional amount.   The applicable period, LIBOR rate and notional amounts are identified in the table below.  

Two of the swaps effectively fix the interest rate on approximately 50% of the aggregate variable interest rate borrowings expected to be outstanding under the Refinancing Facility through September 3, 2020,and three of the swaps effectively fix the interest rate on approximately 80% of the aggregate variable interest rate borrowings expected to be outstanding under the Korean Export Credit Facility through September 30, 2020, and thereafter on approximately 5% of those variable interest rate borrowings through February 20, 2029. The remaining swap effectively fixes the interest rate on approximately 100% of the aggregate variable interest rate borrowings expected to be outstanding under the Sinosure Credit Facility through March 21, 2022, and thereafter on approximately 5% of those variable interest rate borrowings through May 6, 2028 (excluding the incremental increase in available borrowings pursuant to the June 2016 amendment to the Sinosure Credit Facility). When a swap automatically terminates, the Company may elect to replace the swap to hedge the remaining borrowings outstanding under the applicable credit facility as of the swap termination date. Under certain limited circumstances, the relevant subsidiary of the Company has the right to transfer the related interest rate swap(s) to a qualifying third party, which would have the effect of terminating the subsidiary s obligations under those interest rate swaps and/or to cause the novation of the related interest rate swap(s) to a third party derivatives dealer. 

The Company s objective is to limit the variability of cash flows associated with changes in LIBOR interest rate payments due on its credit facilities by using the interest rate swaps to offset the future variable rate interest payments made by the Company. The Company elected to apply hedge accounting and designated the swaps as cash flow hedges. The Company uses regression analysis to test if the swaps are expected to be highly effective (defined as the swaps  offsetting at least 80% and not more than 125% of the hedged interest payments) on both a prospective and retrospective basis. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of the swap agreements, including adjustments for non-performance risk, which are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, are classified in accumulated other comprehensive loss. These amounts are reclassified to interest expense when the hedged interest payments are incurred. Amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss expected to be reclassified into interest expense in the next 12 months are $4.1 million. The ineffective portion, if any, of the change in fair value of the Company s interest rate swap agreements is required to be recognized in earnings. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company s interest rate swap agreements were highly effective; hedge ineffectiveness of $1.5 million, which was recognized in earnings (included in Other expense, net in the consolidated statement of operation) during the second quarter, was reversed due to increases in interest rates.

Table of Contents  

At September 30, 2016, the Company was a party to the following interest rate swaps, which are intended to be cash flow hedges that effectively fix the interest rates for a portion of the Refinancing Facility, the Korean Export Credit Facility and the Sinosure Credit Facility   (dollars in thousands)  :   

(1) 

The initial aggregate notional amount of $333.9 million under the three interest rate swaps is scheduled to increase up to a maximum aggregate notional amount of $680.8 million in order to effectively fix the interest rate on the target percentage of expected borrowings, since the loans under the Korean Export Credit Facility were not fully drawn as of the effective date of the interest rate swap transaction.     

(2) 

As described above, after this date, these swaps effectively fix the interest rate on approximately 5% of the aggregate variable interest rate borrowings of the applicable credit facility through February 20, 2029 in the case of the Korean Export Credit Facility and May 6, 2028 in the case of the Sinosure Credit Facility.

12. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

The estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments are as follows (dollars in thousands): 

Fair value Measurements 

Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Company uses a fair value hierarchy which maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs used to measure fair value with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest: 

Level 1     Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2     Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

Level 3     Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. Level 3 assets or liabilities are those whose values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques with significant unobservable inputs, as well as assets or liabilities for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. 

The Company uses the following methods and assumptions in estimating fair values for its financial instruments: 

Cash and cash equivalents:  The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity or variable rates of these instruments. 

Restricted cash:  The carrying amounts of the Company s other financial instruments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 approximate fair value and are considered to be Level 1 items. 

22 

Table of Contents  

Long-term debt, including current portion, excluding discount:  The carrying amount of the variable rate borrowings under the Refinancing Facility, Korean Export Credit Facility and Amended Sinosure Credit Facility as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 approximates the fair value estimated based on current market rates and the Company s credit spreads. The fair value of the Senior Notes, included in the table above as a component of long-term debt, was based on the income approach using observable Level 2 market expectations at measurement date and standard valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount. Level 2 inputs include futures contracts on LIBOR, LIBOR cash and swap rates and the Company s credit spreads. The Company s credit spread is estimated as the spread over LIBOR which varies from 1.5% to 1.75%.  

Derivatives:  The Company has elected to use the income approach to value the interest rate swap derivatives using observable Level 2 market expectations at measurement date and standard valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount (discounted) reflecting current market expectations about those future amounts.  Level 2 inputs for the derivative valuations are limited to quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets (specifically futures contracts) and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (specifically LIBOR cash and swap rates, implied volatility for floors, basis swap adjustments and credit risk at commonly quoted intervals). Mid-market pricing is used as a practical expedient for fair value measurements. The credit effect on the derivative's fair value is calculated by applying a continuously compounded discount factor based on credit default swap rates of the counterparty when the swap is in an asset position pre-credit and based on the spread over LIBOR of 2% when the swap is in a liability position pre-credit.   

On December 30, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the 2004-built Handymax tanker   Gener8 Consul  . As of December 31, 2015, the   Gener8 Consul   was classified as held for sale. On February 17, 2016, the sale was completed.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, amortization of the fair value of these stock options was $0. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, amortization of the fair value of these stock options was $0 million and $1.2 million, respectively, which is included in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations as a component of general and administrative expense.

2015 Restricted Stock Units 

On June 24, 2015, in connection with the pricing of the Company s IPO, the Company granted members of management RSUs on 1,663,660 shares of the Company s common stock pursuant to the Company s amended 2012 Equity Incentive Plan. The RSUs, which were valued at the IPO price of $14.00 per share, vest ratably in 20% increments or tranches on June 24, 2015, June 30, 2015, December 1, 2016, December 1, 2017 and December 1, 2018, subject for each increment to employment with the Company through the applicable vesting date for such increment. The shares for the first two vesting increments were issued within three business days after December 3, 2015 and the shares for the remaining vesting increments are expected to be issued within a similar short period of time following the vesting date for each of such increments. The unvested RSUs were excluded in determining the diluted net income per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 (see   Note 3, INCOME / (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE  ). On December 3, 2015, the Company issued 574,546 shares in settlement of RSUs that had vested on June 24, 2015 and June 30, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, 44,919 RSUs have been forfeited and 953,279 shares remain to be issued in future years, following the vesting date for each increment.   

Stock options under the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan had been cancelled in connection with the granting of the RSUs. The incremental compensation cost of these RSUs on their grant date of $21.9 million was calculated to be the excess of the fair value of the RSUs over the fair value of the cancelled stock options immediately prior to cancellation and will be amortized over the vesting period using a graded amortization schedule. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compensation expense was $1.4 million and $4.2 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, compensation expense was $1.5 million and $10.4 million, respectively, in connection with the RSUs is included in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations as a component of general and administrative expense. 

2015 Warrant Agreement 

In connection with the 2015 merger, the Company entered into an amended and restated warrant agreement (the  2015 Navig8 warrant agreement ) with Navig8 Limited. Under the 2015 Navig8 warrant agreement, 1,600,000 warrants that had, prior to the Navig8 merger, provided Navig8 Limited the right to purchase 1,600,000 shares of Navig8 Crude common stock at $10 per share, were converted in connection with the 2015 merger into warrants entitling Navig8 Limited to purchase 0.8947 shares of our common stock for each warrant held for a purchase price of $10.00 per warrant, or $11.18 per share. The 2015 Navig8 warrant agreement expired on March 31, 2016. 

2015 Stock Options 

In connection with the 2015 merger, the Company agreed to convert each outstanding option to acquire Navig8 Crude common stock into an option to acquire the number of shares of the common stock of the Company equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Navig8 Crude common stock subject to such stock option immediately prior to the consummation of the 2015 merger by (ii) 0.8947, at an exercise price per share equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the per share exercise price specified in such stock option immediately prior to the 2015 merger by (B) 0.8947. Immediately prior to the consummation of the 2015 merger, there was one option to purchase 15,000 shares of Navig8 common stock at $13.50 per share; this option was converted into an option to purchase 13,420 of the Company s common shares at an exercise price of $15.088 per share. The Company also agreed to treat the option agreement as exercisable through July 8, 2017. 

The fair value of the stock option was calculated by using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. As this stock option was assumed by the Company in conjunction with the 2015 merger, the fair value of this stock option at the date of the 2015 merger of $39.0 thousand was included as part of vessel acquisition costs within Vessels-under-construction as of September 30, 2016. 

16. COMMON STOCK 

At the closing of the 2015 merger, the Company deposited into an account maintained by the 2015 merger exchange and paying agent, in trust for the benefit of Navig8 Crude s former shareholders, 31,233,170 shares of the Company s common stock and $4.5 million in cash. The number of shares and amount of cash deposited into such   

27 

Table of Contents  

account was calculated based on an assumption that the former holders of 1% or less of Navig8 Crude s shares would not be permitted under the 2015 merger agreement to receive shares of the Company as consideration and would receive cash instead. During the period from May 8, 2015 (post-merger) to September 30, 2016, all of these shares and 234,608 additional shares were issued to former shareholders of Navig8 Crude as merger consideration and $3.3 million of cash was returned to the Company from the trust account since the former holders of more than 99.0% of Navig8 Crude s shares received shares of the Company as consideration. As of September 30, 2016, $1.2 million in cash and 31,467,778 shares were issued to former shareholders of Navig8 Crude as merger consideration. As of September 30, 2016, $3.0 thousand of cash remained in the trust account. 

On June 30, 2015, the Company completed its IPO of 15,000,000 shares at $14.00 per share, which resulted in gross proceeds of $210.0 million. After underwriting commissions, the Company received net proceeds of $196.4 million. On July 17, 2015, following the exercise by the underwriters of the IPO of their over-allotment option to purchase 1,882,223 shares of common stock at the public offering price of $14.00 per share, the Company closed the issuance and sale of such shares, resulting in additional gross proceeds of $26.4 million and net proceeds of $24.6 million after underwriting commissions and other registration expenses. Additionally, the Company incurred $6.5 million of issuance costs. 

17. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

From time to time the Company has been, and expects to continue to be, subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of its business, principally personal injury and property casualty claims. Such claims, even if lacking merit, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.  

GENMAR PROGRESS 

In August 2007, an oil sheen was discovered and reported by shipboard personnel in the vicinity of the Genmar Progress, in Guayanilla Bay, Puerto Rico. Subsequently, the U.S. Coast Guard formally designated the Genmar Progress as a source of the pollution incident. In October 2010, the United States, GMR Progress, LLC, and General Maritime Management (Portugal) L.d.A. executed a Joint Stipulation and Settlement Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of this agreement, the United States agreed to accept $6.3 million in full satisfaction of oil spill response costs of the Coast Guard and certain natural damage assessment costs incurred through the date of settlement. The settlement had been paid in full by the vessel s protection   indemnity underwriters. 

In April 2013, the Natural Resource Trustees for the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (the  Trustees ) submitted a claim to GMR Progress, LLC and General Maritime Management (Portugal) L.d.A. for alleged injury to natural resources as a result of this oil spill, primarily seeking monetary damages in the amount of $4.9 million for both loss of beach use and compensation for injury to natural resources such as mangroves, sea grass and coral. On July 7, 2014, the Trustees presented a revised claim for $7.9 million, consisting of $0.9 million for loss of beach use, $5.0 million for injuries to mangroves, sea grass and coral and for uncompensated damage assessment costs and $2.0 million for a 35% contingency for monitoring and oversight. In October 2015, the parties reached an agreement to settle this claim for $2.75 million plus interest, which was approved by the federal court in Puerto Rico. The court order for the approval was entered on September 22, 2016. The settlement was reported to the vessel s protection   indemnity underwriters, who are expected to fund the settlement, which including accrued interest totals $2.75 million. 

2011 VLCC POOL DISPUTE 

Pursuant to an arbitration commenced in January 2013, on August 2, 2013, five vessel owning subsidiaries of the Company (the  2011 VLCC Pool Subs ) that entered into the 2011 VLCC Pool submitted to London arbitration in accordance with the terms of the London Maritime Arbitrator s Association claims of balances due following the withdrawal of their respective vessels from the 2011 VLCC Pool. The claims are for, among other things, amounts due for hire of the vessels and amounts due in respect of working capital invested in the 2011 VLCC Pool. The respondents in the arbitrations, the 2011 VLCC Pool Operator and agent, assert that lesser amounts are owed to the 2011 VLCC Pool Subs by the 2011 VLCC Pool and that the working capital amounts of approximately $1.9 million in the aggregate are not due to be returned until a later date pursuant to the terms of the pool agreements. The respondents also counterclaim for damages for alleged breaches of collateral contracts to the pool agreements, claiming that such contracts purport to

extend the earliest date by which the 2011 VLCC Pool Subs were entitled to withdraw their vessels from the 2011 VLCC Pool. Such counterclaim for damages has not yet been quantified. Submissions in this arbitration have closed. 

ATLAS CHARTER DISPUTE 

On April 22, 2013, GMR Atlas LLC, a vessel owning subsidiary of the Company, submitted to arbitration in accordance with the terms of the London Maritime Arbitrator s Association a claim for declaratory relief as to the proper construction of certain provisions of a charterparty contract (the  Atlas Charterparty ) between GMR Atlas LLC and, the party chartering a vessel from GMR Atlas LLC (the  Atlas Claimant ) relating to, among other things, customer vetting eligibility. The Atlas Claimant is an affiliate of the 2011 VLCC Pool Operator. The Atlas Claimant initially counterclaimed (the  Initial Atlas Claims ) for repayment of hire and other amounts paid under the Atlas Charterparty during the period from July 22, 2012 to November 4, 2012 and also asserted claims for interests and costs. GMR Atlas LLC provided security for those claims, plus amounts in respect of interest and costs, in the sum of $3.5 million pursuant to an escrow agreement (the  Escrow Account ). The Initial Atlas Claims were dismissed with prejudice to the extent they were for repayment of hire or other amounts paid prior to October 26, 2012 and this dismissal is no longer subject to appeal. 

The Atlas Claimant served further submissions on March 7, 2014 which set out claims in the aggregate amount of $4.0 million plus an unquantified claim for interest and legal costs (the  Subsequent Atlas Claims ) arising from the Atlas Charterparty, including primarily claims for damages (as opposed to a claim for repayment) for alleged breaches of customer vetting eligibility requirements. The Subsequent Atlas Claims, in addition to setting out new claims not previously asserted, also include the portion of the Initial Atlas Claims which had not been dismissed. The $3.5 million security previously provided in respect of the Initial Atlas Claims remains held in respect of the Subsequent Atlas Claims. The aggregate amount of claims currently asserted by the Atlas Claimant in respect of the Atlas Charterparty is $4.0 million plus an unquantified claim for interest and legal costs. These claims are presently proceeding in London arbitration. An arbitration hearing is scheduled for December 2016. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, an amount due from the 2011 VLCC Pool and the Atlas charter dispute of $3.4 million was included in Other assets (noncurrent).

You should consider the foregoing when reviewing our financial condition and results of operations and this discussion. In addition, you should read the following discussion together with the condensed consolidated financial statements including the notes to those financial statements for the periods mentioned above. 

General 

We are Gener8 Maritime, Inc., a leading U.S.-based provider of international seaborne crude oil transportation services, resulting from a transformative merger between General Maritime Corporation, a well-known tanker owner,   

30 

Table of Contents  

and Navig8 Crude Tankers Inc., a company sponsored by the Navig8 Group, an independent vessel pool manager. As of September 30, 2016, we owned a fleet of 43 tankers, including 37 vessels on the water, consisting of 20 VLCC vessels, 11 Suezmax vessels, four Aframax vessels and two Panamax vessels, with an aggregate carrying capacity of 7.8 mm DWT, and six  eco  VLCC newbuildings equipped with advanced, fuel-saving technology, that are being constructed at highly reputable shipyards, with expected deliveries through February 2017. 

In March 2014 and February 2015, we acquired a total of 21  eco  newbuilding VLCCs, which we refer to as our VLCC newbuildings. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we took delivery of four VLCC newbuilding vessels, and have six additional VLCCs scheduled to be delivered during the remaining period of 2016 and early 2017. We expect to fund a significant portion of the installment payments in respect of our remaining VLCC newbuildings through borrowings under the Korean Export Credit Facility and the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility. However, there is no assurance we will be able to borrow any additional amounts under the Korean Export Credit Facility or the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility. See     Liquidity and Capital Resources     Debt Financings    for more information. 

We have a significant amount of outstanding indebtedness under our refinancing facility, the Korean Export Credit Facility, and the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility, which we refer to collectively as our  senior secured credit facilities,  and our senior notes. As of September 30, 2016, we owed an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $1.4 billion under our senior secured credit facilities and our senior notes. The senior secured credit facilities provide up to an additional $385.0 million in additional financing (subject to borrowing limits and other conditions set forth in applicable senior secured credit facilities) as of September 30, 2016 in connection with the delivery of 6 VLCC newbuildings. See     Liquidity and Capital Resources.    See   Risk Factors   in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report for a discussion of the risks associated with our ability to borrow future amounts under our senior secured credit facilities. 

During the third quarter of 2016, we entered into agreements for the sale of the 2001-built VLCC tankers   Genmar Vision   and   Genmar Victory   for $28.0 million and $29.0 million, respectively, in gross proceeds. These sales were completed during the third-quarter of 2016. We used the net proceeds from sale of the   Genmar Vision and Genmar Victory   to repay approximately $19.4 million and $19.4 million, respectively, of the related portion of the indebtedness outstanding under the refinancing facility associated with these vessels. 

On June 29, 2016, we amended the Sinosure Credit Facility to, among other things, include two additional term 

loan tranches having an aggregate amount of up to approximately $125.7 million. See     Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt Financings Sinosure Credit Facility    for further information. 

On May 2, 2016, we entered into six interest rate swap transactions that effectively fix the interest rate on a portion of our outstanding variable rate debt to a range of fixed rates. See   Note 10  ,    LONG TERM DEBT   and   Note 11  ,    financial instruments  , to the condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for more information regarding these swap transactions. We may from time to time enter into additional interest rate swaps, caps or similar agreements for all or a significant portion of our remaining variable rate debt under the refinancing facility, the Korean Export Credit Facility and the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility. 

For further description of our businesses, see the  Business  section found in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our financial statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the information under the heading    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Pool, Spot and Time Charter Deployment 

We seek to employ our vessels in a manner that maximizes fleet utilization and earnings upside through our chartering strategy in line with our goal of maximizing shareholder value and returning capital to shareholders when appropriate, taking into account fluctuations in freight rates in the market and our own views on the direction of those rates in the future. As of September 30, 2016, all of our owned and operating vessels were employed in the spot market (either directly or through spot market focused pools), given our expectation of continued favorable near term charter rates. 

Pools typically employ experienced commercial charterers and operators who have close working relationships with customers and brokers while technical management is typically the responsibility of each ship owner. Under pool arrangements, vessels typically enter the pool under a time charter agreement whereby the cost of bunkers and port expenses are borne by the charterer (i.e., the pool) and operating costs, including crews, maintenance and insurance are typically paid by the owner of the vessel. Pools, in return, typically negotiate charters with customers primarily in the spot market. Since the members of a pool typically share in the revenue generated by the entire group of vessels in the pool, and since pools operate primarily in the spot market, including the pools in which we participate, the revenue earned by vessels placed in spot market related pools is subject to the fluctuations of the spot market and the ability of the pool manager to effectively charter its fleet. We believe that vessel pools can provide cost effective commercial management activities for a group of similar class vessels and potentially result in lower waiting times. A spot market voyage charter is generally a contract to carry a specific cargo from a load port to a discharge port for an agreed upon freight per ton of cargo or a specified total amount. Under spot market voyage charters, we pay voyage expenses such as port and fuel costs. A time charter is generally a contract to charter a vessel for a fixed period of time at a set daily or monthly rate. Under time charters, the charterer pays voyage expenses such as port and fuel costs. Vessels operating on time charters provide more predictable cash flows, but can yield lower profit margins than vessels operating in the spot market during periods characterized by favorable market conditions. Vessels operating in the spot market generate revenues that are less predictable but may enable us to capture increased profit margins during periods of improvements in tanker rates although we are exposed to the risk of declining tanker rates and lower utilization. Pools generally consist of a number of vessels which may be owned by a number of different ship owners which operate as a single marketing entity in an effort to produce freight efficiencies. 

As of September 30, 2016, we employed all of our VLCCs, Suezmax and Aframax vessels on the water, in Navig8 Group commercial crude tanker pools, including the VL8 Pool, the Suez8 Pool and the V8 Pool. We refer to the VL8 Pool, the Suez8 Pool and the V8 Pool as the  Navig8 pools.  Our newbuilding and VLCC, Suezmax and Aframax owning subsidiaries have entered into pool agreements regarding the deployment of our vessels into the VL8 Pool, the Suez8 Pool and V8 Pool, respectively. VL8 Pool Inc. acts as the time charterer of the pool vessels in the VL8 Pool, and V8 Pool Inc. acts as the time charterer of the pool vessels in the Suez8 Pool and the V8 Pool, and in each case enters the pool vessels into employment contracts such as voyage charters. VL8 Pool Inc. and V8 Pool Inc. allocate the revenue of VL8 Pool, Suez8 Pool and V8 Pool vessels, as applicable, between all the pool participants based on pool results and a pre-determined allocation method. All of the vessels deployed in the Navig8 pools during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were deployed on spot market voyages. See    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Related Party Transactions Related Party Transactions of Navig8 Crude Tankers, Inc  .  in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding these pool agreements.  

Additionally, one chartered-in VLCC vessel (the   Nave Quasar  ), which we had the right to operate at a gross rate of $26,397 per day pursuant to a time charter under which we had agreed to share 50% of net pool earnings received in respect of such vessel over $30,000 per day, was also deployed in the VL8 Pool between May 2015 and March 2016, the month in which the time charter expired, and the vessel was returned to its owner.  

As of November 10, 2016, we have taken delivery of 17 of our VLCC newbuildings, which we deployed in the VL8 Pool in spot market voyages, and we intend to employ the remainder of our six VLCC newbuildings in the VL8 Pool after delivery of the vessels.

We are constantly evaluating opportunities to increase the number of our vessels deployed on time charters, but only expect to enter into additional time charters if we can obtain contract terms that satisfy our criteria. We may also consider deploying our vessels on time charters for customers to use as floating storage. We believe that historically, during certain periods of higher charter rates, we benefited from greater cash flow stability through the use of time charters for part of our fleet, while maintaining the flexibility to benefit from improvements in market rates by deploying the balance of our vessels in the spot market. We may utilize a similar strategy to the extent that time charter rates rise and market conditions become favorable. We may also utilize time charters to lock in contracted rates when we believe the rate environment could weaken or decline in the future. 

Non-U.S. operations accounted for a majority of our revenues and results of operations. Vessels regularly move between countries in international waters, over hundreds of trade routes. It is therefore impractical to assign revenues, earnings or assets from the transportation of international seaborne crude oil and petroleum products by geographical area. Each of our vessels serves the same type of customer, has similar operations and maintenance requirements, operates in the same regulatory environment, and is subject to similar economic characteristics. Based on this, we have determined that we operate in one reportable segment, the transportation of crude oil and petroleum products with our fleet of vessels. 

Net Voyage Revenues as Performance Measure 

We evaluate performance using net voyage revenues. Net voyage revenues are voyage revenues minus voyage expenses. Voyage expenses primarily consist of port and fuel costs that are unique to a particular voyage. Consequently, spot charter rates are generally higher than time charter rates to allow spot charter vessel owners the ability to recoup voyage expenses. Voyage expenses typically are paid by the charterer when a vessel is under a time charter and by the vessel owner when a vessel is under a spot charter. We believe that utilizing net voyage revenues neutralizes the variability created by unique costs associated with particular voyages or the manner in which vessels are deployed and presents a more accurate representation of the revenues generated by our vessels on a comparable basis whether on spot or time charters. 

Our voyage revenues are recognized ratably over the duration of the spot market voyages and the lives of the time charters. We recognize the revenues of time charters that contain rate escalation schedules at the average rate during the life of the contract. 

As of September 30, 2016, all of our vessels, with the exception of two vessels (the   Gener8 Companion   and   Gener8 Compatriot  ) that remained in the spot market, were deployed in the Navig8 pools, and all of our vessels in the Navig8 pools have been chartered on the spot voyage market. The pool operators of the Navig8 pools act as the time charterer of the pool vessels, and enter the pool vessels into employment contracts. We generally recognize revenue from the Navig8 pools based on our portion of the net distributions reported by the relevant pool, which represents the net voyage revenue of the pool after pool manager fees. See   Note 14  ,    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  , to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for more information on the Navig8 pools.  

As of September 30, 2015, none of our vessels were chartered into the Unique Tankers pool. We were the sole vessel owner in the Unique Tankers pool, and all the vessels in the Unique Tankers pool were chartered on the spot voyage market. Since all vessels in the Unique Tankers pool were owned by us and since Unique Tankers LLC is one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, we recognized revenues from the Unique Tankers pool based upon the percentage of voyage completion.

The following table shows the calculation of net voyage revenues: 

As used in this Quarterly Report, vessels deployed in the spot market includes vessels chartered into the Unique Tankers pool, but excludes vessels chartered into the Navig8 pools, and vessels chartered into the Navig8 pools includes vessels deployed in the spot market through the Navig8 pools.  

During the year ended December 31, 2015, and subsequent to the 2015 merger on May 7, 2015, we changed our fleet s deployment strategy and entered the majority of our vessels into the Navig8 commercial crude tanker pools. These pools are the VL8 Pool, for VLCC vessels, the Suez8 Pool, for Suezmax vessels and the V8 Pool, for Aframax vessels. Under these pool arrangements, vessels typically enter the pool under a time charter agreement whereby the cost of bunkers and port expenses are borne by the charterer (i.e., the pool) and operating costs, including crews, maintenance and insurance are typically paid by the owner of the vessel.  

We calculate time charter equivalent, or  TCE,  rates by dividing net voyage revenue by total operating days for fleet for the relevant time period. Total operating days for fleet are the total number of days our vessels are in our possession for the relevant period net of off hire days associated with major repairs, drydocking and special or intermediate surveys. We also generate demurrage revenue, which represents fees charged to charterers associated with our spot market voyages when the charterer exceeds the agreed upon time required to load or discharge a cargo. We calculate daily direct vessel operating expenses, or  DVOE,  and daily general and administrative expenses for the relevant period by dividing the total expenses by the aggregate number of calendar days that the vessels are in our possession for the period including offhire days associated with major repairs, drydockings and special or intermediate surveys. 

Seasonality 

We operate our vessels in markets that have historically exhibited seasonal variations in tanker demand and, as a result, in charter rates. Tanker markets are typically stronger in the fall and winter months (the fourth and first quarters of the calendar year) in anticipation of increased oil consumption in the Northern Hemisphere during the winter months. Unpredictable weather patterns and variations in oil reserves disrupt vessel scheduling and could adversely impact charter rates.

Please refer to the remainder of this    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    for the factors affecting comparability across the periods.   On May 7, 2015, in connection with the filing of our Third Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, all of our Class A shares and Class B shares were converted on a one-to-one basis to a single class of common stock. At the closing of the 2015 merger on May 7, 2015, we issued 31,233,170 shares of our common stock into a trust account for the benefit of Navig8 Crude s former shareholders. During the period from May 8, 2015 to September 30, 2016, we issued all of these shares and 234,608 additional shares of our common stock to Navig8 Crude s former shareholders. Since we may be required to adjust the proportion of cash and stock as merger consideration depending on whether Navig8 Crude s former shareholders are permitted to receive shares as consideration for the 2015 merger, the number of our shares outstanding is subject to change.        

In connection with the closing of the 2015 merger, we issued 483,971 shares of our common stock as a commitment premium paid to the commitment parties under the 2015 equity purchase agreement, we assumed an outstanding Navig8 Crude warrant and option to purchase an aggregate of 1,444,940 shares of our common stock, and we acquired cash and cash equivalents of $41.4 million and vessels under construction of $364.2 million.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation 

EBITDA represents net income (loss) plus net interest expense and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted to exclude the items set forth in the table below, which represent certain non-cash, one-time and other items that we believe are not indicative of the ongoing performance of our core operations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used by   analysts in the shipping industry as common performance measures   to compare results across peers. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not items recognized by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ), and should not be considered in isolation or used as alternatives to net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activity or any other indicator of our operating performance or liquidity required by GAAP. Our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is intended to supplement investors  understanding of our operating performance by providing information regarding our ongoing performance that exclude items we believe do not directly affect our core operations and enhancing the comparability of our ongoing performance across periods. We present Adjusted EBITDA in addition to EBITDA because Adjusted EBITDA eliminates the impact of additional non-cash, one-time and other items not associated with the ongoing performance of our core operations, including charges associated with stock-based compensation, gains and losses on the sale of vessels and costs associated with our financing activities, that we believe further reduce the comparability of the ongoing performance of our core operations across periods. Our management considers EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be useful to investors because such performance measures provide information regarding the profitability of our core operations and facilitate comparison of our operating performance to the operating performance of our peers. Additionally, our management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as performance measures and they are also presented for review at our board meetings. While we believe these measures are useful to investors, the definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA used by us may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. In addition, these definitions are also not the same as the definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA used in the financial covenants in our debt instruments. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we excluded from Adjusted EBITDA Goodwill impairment because these are non-cash expenses that we do not believe reflect the ongoing performance of our core operations across periods. In addition, during the three months ended September 30, 2016, we excluded from Adjusted EBITDA Non-cash G A expenses, excluding stock-based compensation expense, to conform its presentation to the Adjusted EBITDA presentation in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

Set forth below is the EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation.

Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 

Total voyage revenues.    Total voyage revenues decreased by $17.0 million, or 19.1%, to $72.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $89.3 million for the prior year period. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in spot charter revenue of $19.6 million and time charter revenues of $7.0 million, partially offset by an increase in Navig8 pool revenues of $9.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. 

Total voyage revenues decreased by $24.9 million, or 7.6%, to $302.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $327.2 million for the prior period. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in spot charter revenue of $223.3 million and time charter revenues of $12.3 million, partially offset by an increase in Navig8 pool revenue of $210.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. 

We refer to charter hire rates as a measure of the average daily revenue performance of a vessel on a per voyage basis, determined by dividing voyage revenue by total operating days for the applicable fleet. 

Navig8 pool revenues.      Our Navig8 pool revenues (which are distributed on a net basis after deduction of voyage expenses, which are the responsibility of the pool, and certain administrative expenses) increased by $9.5 million, or 17.0%, to $65.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $56.0 million during the prior year period. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in our vessel operating days in Navig8 pools of 1,477 days, to 2,944 days for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 1,468 days during the prior year period. The increase in vessel operating days resulted in an increase in Navig8 pool revenues of approximately $32.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. The increase in Navig8 pool revenues was partially offset by a decline in our average daily Navig8 pool charter hire rates, which decreased by $15,897, or 41.7%, to $22,251 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $38,148 for the prior year period. The decline in our average daily Navig8 pool charter hire rates resulted in a decrease in Navig8 pool revenues of approximately $23.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period.  

Our Navig8 pool revenues increased by $210.7 million, or 350.0%, to $271.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $60.2 million during the prior year period. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in our vessel operating days in Navig8 pools of 6,353, to 7,913 days for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 1,560 days during the prior period. The increase in vessel operating days resulted in increases in Navig8 pool revenues of approximately $217.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. The increase in Navig8 pool revenues was partially offset by a decline in our average daily Navig8 pool charter hire rates, which decreased by $4,354, or 11.3%, to $34,244 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $38,598 for the prior year period. The decline in our average daily Navig8 pool charter hire rates resulted in a decrease in Navig8 pool revenues of approximately $6.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. 

Time charter revenues.      Time charter revenues decreased by $6.9 million, or 100%, to $0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $6.9 million for the prior year period. The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in our time charter days of 205 days, or 100.0%, to 0 days for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. The decrease in our time charter days was primarily due to the sale of our previously time chartered vessels (the   Genmar Victory   and   Genmar Vision  ) during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

Time charter revenues decreased by $12.3 million, or 57.1%, to $9.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $21.6 million for the prior year period. The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in our time charter days of 460 days, or 67.9%, to 218 days for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 678 days for the prior year period. The decrease in our time charter days was primarily due to the sale of our previously time chartered vessels (the   Genmar Victory   and   Genmar Vision  ) during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in our time charter days decreased time charter revenues by approximately $19.5 million for the nine

months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. The decrease in time charter revenues was partially offset by an increase in our average daily time charter hire rates, which increased by $10,634, or 33.3%, to $42,563 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $31,929 in the prior year period. The increase in average daily time charter hire rates resulted in an increase in time charter revenues of approximately $7.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. 

Spot charter revenues.    Spot charter revenues decreased by $19.7 million, or 74.5%, to $6.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $26.4 million for the prior year period. This decrease was primarily the result of the transition of our vessels from the spot market into the Navig8 pools, which resulted in a decrease in our spot charter days of 338 days, or 61.3%, to 213 days for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 551 days for the prior year period. The decrease in our spot charter days resulted in a decrease in our spot charter revenues of approximately $10.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. Contributing to the decrease in spot charter revenues was a decline in our average daily spot charter hire rates, which decreased by $16,240, or 34.0%, to $31,596 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $47,837 in the prior year period. The decrease in our average daily spot charter hire rates resulted in a decrease in spot charter revenues of approximately $8.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. 

Spot charter revenues decreased by $223.3 million, or 91.0%, to $22.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $245.3 million for the prior year period. The decrease in spot charter revenues was primarily the result of the transition of our vessels from the spot market into the Navig8 pools, which resulted in a decrease in our spot charter days of 3,716 days, or 84.3%, to 692 days for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 4,408 days for the prior year period. The decrease in our spot charter, resulted in a decrease in our spot charter revenues of approximately $118.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. Contributing to the decreases in spot charter revenues was a decline in our average daily spot charter hire rates, which decreased by $23,845, or 42.9% to $31,807 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $55,652 in the prior year period. The decrease in our average daily spot charter hire rates resulted in a decrease in spot charter revenues of approximately $105.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period.  

Voyage expenses.    Substantially all of our voyage expenses relate to spot charter voyages, under which the vessel owner is responsible for voyage expenses such as fuel and port costs. No material voyage expenses were associated with our vessels deployed in the Navig8 pools as Navig8 pool revenues are presented on a net basis after deduction of voyage expenses, as such expenses are the responsibility of the pool. 

Voyage expenses decreased by $7.3 million, or 70.0%, to $3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $10.5 million for the prior year period. The decrease of voyage expenses was primarily the result of decreases in fuel costs and port costs during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year period. Fuel costs, which represent the largest component of voyage expenses, decreased by $4.2 million, or 67.3%, to $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $6.3 million for the prior year period. This decrease in fuel costs was primarily attributable to the 61.3% decrease (from 551 days to 213 days) in our spot market days during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the prior year period, as a result of transitioning our vessels from spot charter voyages into the Navig8 pools. The decrease in our spot market days decreased fuel costs by approximately $3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. Daily fuel costs decreased by $1,742, or 15.1%, to $9,774 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $11,516 for the prior year period. The decrease in our daily fuel costs reduced voyage expenses by approximately $1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. Port costs, which can vary depending on the geographic regions in which the vessels operate and their trading patterns, decreased by $1.0 million, or 53.0%, to $0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.8 million for the prior year period. The decrease in port costs was primarily due to the decrease in our spot market days discussed above during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year period. Also contributing to the decrease in port costs were differences in the ports visited during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year period. 

Voyage expenses decreased by $83.5 million, or 90.0%, to $9.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $93.2 million for the prior year period. The decrease of voyage expenses was primarily the result

of decreases in fuel costs and port costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year period. Fuel costs decreased by $52.4 million, or 91.1%, to $5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $57.5 million for the prior year period. This decrease in fuel costs was primarily attributable to the 84.3% decrease (from 4,408 days to 692 days) in our spot market days during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period, as a result of transitioning our vessels from spot charter voyages into the Navig8 pools. The decrease in our spot market days decreased fuel costs by approximately $27.4 million, or 52.3%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. Daily fuel costs decreased by $5,668, or 43.5%, to $7,370 compared to $13,038 in the prior year period. The decrease in our daily fuel costs reduced voyage expenses by approximately $25.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. Port costs decreased by $22.8 million, or 89.9%, to $2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $25.4 million for the prior year period. The decrease in port costs was primarily due to the decrease in our spot market days discussed above during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year period. Also contributing to the decrease in port costs were differences in the ports visited during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year period. 

Net voyage revenues.    Net voyage revenues, which are voyage revenues minus voyage expenses, decreased by $9.7 million, or 12.3%, to $69.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $78.8 million for the prior year period. The decrease in net voyage revenues was primarily attributable to the decrease in our average daily fleet TCE rate by $13,535, or 38.2%, to $21,887 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $35,422 for the prior year period. The decrease in average daily fleet TCE rate resulted in a decrease in net voyage revenue of approximately $30.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. The decrease in net voyage revenues was partially offset by an increase in our vessel operating days by 933 days, or 42%, to 3,157 days, compared to 2,224 days for prior year period. The increase in our vessel operating days was primarily the result of the deployment of fourteen additional VLCC newbuilding vessels since the end of the prior year period. Also contributing to the increase in our vessel operating days was an increase in fleet utilization of 4.9% to 97.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 92.5% for the prior year period. The increase in our vessel operating days resulted in an increase in net voyage revenue of approximately $20.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period.  

Net voyage revenues increased by $58.6 million, or 25.0%, to $292.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $234.0 million for the prior year period. The increase in net voyage revenues was primarily attributable to the increase in our vessel operating days by 2,177 days, or 32.8%, to 8,823 days for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 6,646 days in the prior year period. The increase in our vessel operating days resulted in an increase in net voyage revenue of approximately $72.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. The increase in our vessel operating days was primarily the result of the deployment of twelve additional VLCC newbuilding vessels since the end of the prior year period. The increase in net voyage revenues was partially offset by the decrease in our average daily fleet TCE rate by $2,048, or 5.8%, to $33,159 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $35,207 for the prior year period. The decrease in average daily fleet TCE rate resulted in a decrease in net voyage revenue of approximately $13.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period.

Direct Vessel Operating Expenses.    Direct vessel operating expenses, which include crew costs, provisions, deck and engine stores, lubricating oil, insurance, maintenance and repairs for owned vessels increased by $6.5 million, or 31.4%, to $27.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $20.5 million for the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to an increase in our average fleet size to 35.2 vessels for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 25.2 vessels for the prior year period, and associated increases in crew costs and maintenance and repair costs. Crew costs increased by $3.7 million, or 38.5% to $13.1 million for the three months ended September 20, 2016, compared to $9.4 million for the prior year period, and maintenance and repair increased by $1.0 million, or 30.8% to $4.3 million for the three months ended September 20, 2016, compared to $3.3 million for the prior year period. The increase in direct vessel operating expenses was partially offset by a decrease in daily direct vessel operating expenses per vessel of $222, or 2.6%, to $8,322 per day for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $8,544 per day for the prior year period, primarily as a result of lower operating costs, including insurance, repair and maintenance and other costs, associated with our newly delivered vessels. We estimate that this decrease in daily direct vessel operating expenses per vessel resulted in a decrease in direct vessel operating expenses of approximately $0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. 

Direct vessel operating expenses increased by $14.4 million, or 23.1%, to $77.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $62.6 million for the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to an increase in our average fleet size to 33.1 vessels for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 25.1 vessels for the prior year period, and associated increases in crew costs, maintenance and repair costs and lubricating oil costs. Crew costs increased by $7.7 million, or 26.2% to $37.2 million for the nine months ended September 20, 2016, compared to $29.5 million for the prior year period, and maintenance and repair increased by $1.5 million, or 13.9% to $11.9 million for the nine months ended September 20, 2016, compared to $10.4 million for the prior year period. Lubricating oil costs increased by $0.9 million, or 25.7% to $4.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $3.5 million for the prior year period. The increase in direct vessel operating expenses was partially offset by a decrease in daily direct vessel operating expenses per vessel of $532, or 5.9%, to $8,430 per day for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $8,962 per day for the prior year period, primarily as a result of lower operating costs, including insurance, repair and maintenance and other costs, associated with our newly delivered vessels. We estimate that this decrease in daily direct vessel operating expenses per vessel resulted in a decrease in direct vessel operating expenses of approximately $4.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we incurred severance charges related to a change in the vessel management of seven vessels between third-party ship management companies, which resulted in inclusion of a greater amount of third-party management fees in direct vessel operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Navig8 charterhire expenses.      Navig8 charterhire expenses decreased by $4.7 million, or 99.6% to $19 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $4.1 million, or 55.5% to $3.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $4.7 million and $7.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. These charterhire expenses were related to the   Nave Quasar  , a vessel chartered-in by Gener8 Maritime Subsidiary Inc. (formerly known as Navig8 Crude Tankers, Inc.), which became our subsidiary as a result of the 2015 merger. Navig8 charterhire expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 included profit share adjustments related to the profit share plan for the   Nave Quasar  . The time charter under which this vessel had been chartered-in expired, and the vessel was redelivered to its owner, in March 2016. 

General and Administrative Expenses.    General and administrative expenses decreased by $1.1 million, or 13.1%, to $7.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $8.2 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in legal and professional expenses of $1.3 million, or 47.0% to $1.5 million, compared to $2.8 million in the prior year period, primarily related to debt financing activities that occurred in the prior year period. This decrease was partially offset by non-employee directors compensation of $0.3 million recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2016 that did not occur in the prior year period.  

General and administrative expenses decreased by $5.9 million, or 21.0%, to $22.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $28.1 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily the result of decreases in employee compensation expense of $6.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily attributable to higher compensation costs of restricted stock units and option amortization in the prior year period in connection with the Company s initial public offering. The decrease in general and administrative expenses

was partially offset by an increase in legal and professional expenses of $0.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily related to debt financing activities and interest rate swaps, as well as other expenses associated with being a publicly traded company. This decrease was also partially offset by fees paid pursuant to the corporate administration agreement with a subsidiary of Navig8 Limited of $1.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 that did not occur in the prior year period. 

Depreciation and Amortization.      Depreciation and amortization, which includes depreciation of vessels as well as amortization of drydock and special survey costs, increased by $11.5 million, or 99.3%, to $23.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $11.6 million for the prior year period. Depreciation and amortization increased by $27.0 million, or 80.4%, to $60.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $33.6 million for the prior year period. Vessel depreciation increased by $10.7 million, or 106.8%, to $20.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $10.1 million in the prior year period. Vessel depreciation increased by $25.0 million, or 85.0%, to $54.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $29.4 million in the prior year period. Amortization of drydocking costs increased by $0.8 million, or 63.6%, to $2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.2 million in the prior year period, and by $1.9 million, or 53.1%, to $5.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $3.5 million for the prior year period. The increase in vessel depreciation and amortization of drydocking costs in each period was primarily due to the increase in our fleet size and the additional drydocking costs incurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year periods. 

Goodwill Impairment.    For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a goodwill impairment of $23.3 million. Additionally, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, in connection with the sale of the   Genmar Victory   and   Genmar Vision  , we wrote-off $3.0 million of related goodwill. 

Loss on Vessel Disposal, Net.    During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred losses associated with the disposal of vessels and certain vessel equipment of $10.8 million in each period, primarily related to the sale of the   Genmar Victory   and   Genmar Vision  . Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, following the liquidation of foreign subsidiaries, we recorded a $0.7 million gain related to the write-off of the accumulated translation adjustment component of equity. 

Closing of Portugal Office.    During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we incurred $0.1 million and $0.5 million, respectively, of costs associated with the closing of the Portugal office, which was closed in the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Interest Expense, Net.    Interest expense, net increased by $13.5 million to $13.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0.2 million for the prior year period. The increase was primarily attributable to the decrease in capitalized interest of $5.8 million, or 46.4%, to $6.7 million compared to $12.5 million for the prior year period related to the capitalization of interest expense associated with vessels under construction as a result of the funding of the acquisition of our VLCC newbuildings. Capitalized interest results in a reduction of interest expense, net.     We do not capitalize interest expense associated with the funding of our VLCC newbuildings after delivery of the vessels. Contributing to the increase in interest expense, net during the three months ended September 30, 2016, was an increase in interest expense associated with our credit facilities of $3.0 million, or 42.6%, to $10.1 million compared to $7.1 million for the prior year period due to the increase in outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities and senior notes. Our outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities and senior notes were $1.4 billion and $0.7 billion as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Also contributing to the increase in interest expense, net were increases in amortization of deferred financing costs of $2.4 million to $2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0.5 million for the prior year period, and commitment fees of $0.4 million, or 52.9% to $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0.8 million for prior year period. We incurred these additional deferred financing costs and commitment fees in connection with our entry into the refinancing credit facility, which refinanced our former senior secured credit facilities, and the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility and the Korean Export Credit Facility, which we have used to fund a portion of the remaining installment payments due under the Acquired VLCC Newbuildings contracts.

In addition, in May 2016, we entered into six interest rate swap transactions that effectively fix the interest rate on a portion of our outstanding variable rate debt to a range of fixed rates. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded $1.4 million related to interest rate swaps settlements as interest expense, net. 

Interest expense, net increased by $20.3 million, or 181.6%, to $31.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $11.1 million for the prior year period. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in amortization of deferred financing costs of $7.0 million to $8.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.1 million for the prior year period.  Also contributing to this increase in interest expense, net was an increase in interest expense associated with our credit facilities and senior notes of $6.7 million, or 32.0%, to $27.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $21.1 million for the prior year period, and an increase in commitment fees of $3.7 million to $4.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0.8 million for the prior year period.  

In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded $1.5 million related to interest rate swaps settlements as interest expense, net. 

Other Financing Costs.     During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, in connection with the consummation of the 2015 merger, we issued an aggregate of 483,970 shares to the commitment parties as a commitment premium as consideration for their purchase commitments under such agreement. The commitment to purchase our common stock by the commitment parties was terminated upon the consummation of our initial public offering, and the related expenses of $6.0 million, representing the value of the commitment premium as of the issuance date, were reflected as other financing costs.  

Other (expense) income, net.      During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company s interest rate swap agreements were highly effective; hedge ineffectiveness of $1.5 million which was recognized in earnings as other (expense) income, net during the three months ended June 30, 2016, was reversed due to increases in interest rates during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Sources and Uses of Funds; Cash Management 

Since 2012, our principal sources of funds have been cash flow from operations, equity financings, issuance of long term debt and long term bank borrowings. Our principal uses of funds have been capital expenditures for vessel acquisitions and construction, maintenance of the quality of our vessels, compliance with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations, funding working capital requirements and repayments on outstanding indebtedness. Our practice has been to acquire vessels or newbuilding contracts using a combination of available cash, issuances of equity securities, bank debt secured by mortgages on our vessels and long term debt securities. 

We have entered into several senior secured credit facilities to fund a significant portion of the amounts owed on our existing newbuilding commitments. We expect to use borrowings under the Korean Export Credit Facility and the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility, in addition to our operating cash flows, to fund the amounts owed on our existing newbuilding commitments. Our ability to borrow any further amounts under the Korean Export Credit Facility and the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility is subject to various conditions and we may be liable for damages if we breach our obligations under our VLCC shipbuilding contracts. Accordingly, there is no assurance that we will be able to borrow sufficient funds under the Korean Export Credit Facility and Amended Sinosure Credit Facility. To the extent that any such sources of financing are not available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, we may also review other debt and equity financing alternatives to fund such existing commitments.  

Since we entered into the Korean Export Credit Facility and the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility, appraised values of our vessels have declined significantly, which has reduced the amounts that we are permitted to borrow pursuant to the borrowing limits and conditions under these credit facilities. Any reductions in the amounts that we are permitted to borrow under our credit facilities may negatively affect our liquidity.

As of September 30, 2016, we had an aggregate amount of up to approximately $385.0 million of available borrowings under the Korean Export Credit Facility and the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility (subject to borrowing limits and other conditions described below) for the purpose of financing future deliveries of six VLCC newbuilding vessels with remaining installment payments of $307.4 million. Subsequent to September 30, 2016, we took delivery of two VLCC newbuilding vessels, including the last VLCC newbuilding securing the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility. Following these deliveries, we have an aggregate amount of up to approximately $254.1 million of available borrowings under the Korean Export Credit Facility for the purpose of financing future deliveries of four VLCC newbuilding vessels with remaining installment payments of $204.2 million. Based on the valuation of our vessels from appraisals of November 4, 2016, we estimate that our available borrowings under the Korean Export Credit Facility for these four future deliveries will be limited to $204.0 million. To the extent vessel values decline further, we estimate that our potential borrowings under the Korean Export Credit Facility would be reduced by $0.60 for each $1.00 decline in appraised value. 

We are subject to various collateral maintenance, financial and other covenants under our senior secured credit facilities as further described below. Under our refinancing facility and Korean Export Credit Facility, we are subject to a minimum cash balance covenant pursuant to which we are not permitted to allow the sum of (A) our cash and cash equivalents plus (B) amounts deposited in segregated debt service reserve accounts relating to the Korean Export Credit Facility and the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility (valued at 50% of par) to be less than the greater of (i) $50 million or (ii) 5% of our total indebtedness. Under our Amended Sinosure Credit Facility, we are subject to a minimum cash balance covenant pursuant to which we are not permitted to allow the sum of (A) our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents plus (B) amounts deposited in segregated debt service reserve accounts relating to the Korean Export Credit Facility and the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility (valued at 50% of par) to be less than the greatest of (i) $50 million, (ii) 5% of our total indebtedness and (iii) $1.5 million per vessel delivered under the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility (which was $9 million as of September 30, 2016). As of September 30, 2016, the minimum amount required under these credit facilities was $72.5 million. In addition, under our refinancing facility, Korean Export Credit Facility and Amended Sinosure Credit Facility, our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents must be at least $25 million. As of September 30, 2016, we are in compliance with our minimum cash balance covenants. As of that date, we had cash and cash equivalents, which included $21.9 million held in segregated debt service reserve accounts, of $100.0 million. 

We are also subject to a debt service coverage ratio covenant under our Amended Sinosure Credit Facility pursuant to which our ratio of consolidated EBITDA to the aggregate scheduled principal repayments and cash interest expense for consolidated indebtedness, each as defined in the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility, must be no less than 1.10. We refer to this ratio as the  Debt Service Coverage Ratio.  As of September 30, 2016, we are in compliance with our debt service coverage ratio covenant. For the 12 month testing period, as defined in the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility, ended September 30, 2016, our Debt Service Coverage Ratio was 1.44.   

Under our senior secured credit facilities, we are subject to collateral maintenance covenants pursuant to which the aggregate appraised value of vessels pledged as collateral under each credit facility may not be less than certain specified amounts. Under the refinancing facility, the appraised value of pledged vessels may not be less than 135% through September 3, 2017 and 140% thereafter of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding loans under the credit facility. Under the Korean Export Credit Facility, the appraised value of pledged vessels may not be less than 135% through August 30, 2017 and 140% thereafter of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding loans under the credit facility. Under the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility, the appraised value of pledged vessels may not be less than 135% of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding loans under the credit facility. As of September 30, 2016, we are in compliance with our collateral maintenance covenants. We estimate that we would not have been in compliance with the collateral maintenance covenants as of that date if the valuation of our collateral under the refinancing facility, Korean Export Credit Facility and Amended Sinosure Credit Facility from appraisals of November 4, 2016 were to decline by approximately 6.7%, 12.8% and 3.8%, respectively. 

In the event of continued weakness in charter rates and vessel values, if the current market environment declines further or does not recover sufficiently and/or because of the potential timing of receipt of payments and required expenditures, there is a possibility that we may not comply with these covenants as early as the first half of 2017 absent waivers or amendments to our senior secured credit facilities or obtaining additional capital. There is a possibility we may not be in compliance earlier in the event of further weakness or deterioration in the markets in which we operate. To address these issues, we intend to pursue alternatives which may include potential dispositions of vessels and/or

newbuildings, strategic transactions to strengthen our capital structure, waivers or amendments from our lenders and/or other options. Any such transactions may be subject to conditions. If market or other conditions are not favorable, we may be unable to complete any such transactions or obtain waivers or amendments from our lenders on acceptable terms or at all. 

Absent such waivers or amendments, if we do not comply with these covenants     and fail to cure our non-compliance following applicable notice and expiration of applicable cure periods, we would be in default of one or more of our credit facilities. If such a default occurs, we may also be in default under our unsecured senior notes. Each of our current debt facilities contain cross default provisions that could be triggered by our failure to comply with these covenants. As a result, some or all of our indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable. We may not have sufficient assets available to satisfy our obligations. Substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral to our lenders, and our lenders may seek to foreclose on their collateral if a default occurs. We may have to seek alternative sources of financing on terms that may not be favorable to us or that may not be available at all. Therefore, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

Moreover, in the event we are in default, we will not be able to borrow additional amounts under our Korean Export Credit Facility.   If we are unable to borrow under this credit facility, our ability to finance our remaining VLCC newbuildings could be materially adversely affected. If for any reason we fail to make an installment payment under our shipbuilding contracts when due, which may result in a default under our shipbuilding contracts, we would be prevented from taking delivery of the newbuilding vessels and realizing potential revenues from these vessels, we could lose all or a portion of any payments previously paid by us in respect of these vessels and we could be liable for any additional damages resulting from a breach by us of the contracts. We may also lose any equipment provided to the shipyard as buyers  supplies for installation by the shipyard on the vessels. 

We believe that our current cash balance, operating cash flows and future borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next year. See   Note 6,   Vessels under construction  , to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 for more information relating to the shipbuilding contracts for the VLCC newbuildings. 

Our business is capital intensive and our future success will depend on our ability to maintain a high quality fleet through the acquisition of newer vessels and the selective sale of older vessels. These acquisitions will be principally subject to management s expectation of future market conditions as well as our ability to acquire vessels on favorable terms. In the future, we may engage in additional debt or equity financing transactions to fund such acquisitions or raise funds for other corporate purposes. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all. 

Equity Issuances 

In connection with the consummation of the 2015 merger that closed on May 7, 2015, we issued 31,233,170 shares of our common stock into a trust account for the benefit of Navig8 Crude s former shareholders. During the period from May 8, 2015 to September 30, 2016, we issued all of these shares and 234,608 additional shares of our common stock to Navig8 Crude s former shareholders. Since we may be required to adjust the proportion of cash and stock as merger consideration depending on whether Navig8 Crude s former shareholders are permitted to receive shares as consideration for the 2015 merger, the number of our shares outstanding is subject to change.

Debt Financings 

The following description is a summary of our various debt financings. See    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations     Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt Financings    in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our debt financings. 

Refinancing Facility  .        On September 3, 2015, we entered into the refinancing facility to refinance our former senior secured credit facilities. The refinancing facility provides for term loans up to the aggregate approximate amount of $581.0 million. As of September 30, 2016, $420.0 million was outstanding under the refinancing facility. The loans under the refinancing facility will mature on September 3, 2020.  

The refinancing facility bears interest at a rate per annum based on LIBOR plus a margin of 3.75% per annum. If there is a failure to pay any amount due on a loan under the refinancing facility, interest shall accrue at a rate 2.00% higher than the interest rate that would otherwise have been applied to such amount. The refinancing facility is secured on a first lien basis by a pledge of various assets, including, as of September 30, 2016, 5 VLCCs, 11 Suezmax vessels, 4 Aframax vessels and 2 Panamax vessels. 

We are obligated to repay the refinancing facility in 20 consecutive quarterly installments, commencing on December 31, 2015. We are also required to prepay the refinancing facility upon the occurrence of certain events, such as a sale or total loss of a vessel pledged as collateral under the refinancing facility.  

We are also subject to various collateral maintenance, financial and other covenants, restrictions on payments of dividends, events of default and remedies under the refinancing facility. See    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations     Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt Financings Refinancing Facility    in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding the refinancing facility. 

Korean Export Credit Facility  .        On September 3, 2015, we entered into the Korean Export Credit Facility to fund a portion of the remaining installment payments due under shipbuilding contracts for 15 VLCC newbuildings which are being built at Korean shipyards. The Korean Export Credit Facility provides for term loans up to the aggregate approximate amount of $963.7 million, which is comprised of a tranche of term loans to be made available by a syndicate of commercial lenders up to the aggregate approximate amount of $282.0 million, which we refer to as the  Commercial Tranche,  a tranche of term loans to be fully guaranteed by the Export-Import Bank of Korea, which we refer to as  KEXIM  up to the aggregate approximate amount of $139.7 million, which we refer to as the  KEXIM Guaranteed Tranche,  a tranche of term loans to be made available by KEXIM up to the aggregate approximate amount of $197.4 million, which we refer to as the  KEXIM Funded Tranche  and a tranche of term loans insured by Korea Trade Insurance Corporation, which we refer to as  K-Sure  up to the aggregate approximate amount of $344.6 million, which we refer to as the  K-Sure Tranche . 

Borrowings under each term loan will be available to be drawn at or around the time of delivery of each VLCC newbuilding funded by the Korean Export Credit Facility in an amount equal to the lowest of (i) 65% of the final contract price of such VLCC newbuilding, (ii) 65% of the maximum contract price of such VLCC newbuilding and (iii) 60% of the fair market value of such VLCC newbuilding tested at or around the time of delivery of such VLCC newbuilding. Our ability to utilize these funds is subject to the actual delivery of the vessel and other borrowing conditions. As of September 30, 2016, $565.6 million was outstanding under the Korean Export Credit Facility, and up to $322.2 million of borrowings were available (subject to borrowing limits and conditions) to fund the delivery of 5 vessels, which have an aggregate of $251.8 million of remaining installment payments due prior to the delivery of the vessels. Each loan will mature, in respect of the Commercial Tranche, on the date falling 60 months from the date of borrowing of that loan and, in respect of the other tranches, on the date falling 144 months from the date of borrowing of that loan. 

The Korean Export Credit Facility bears interest at a rate per annum based on LIBOR plus a margin of, in relation to the Commercial Tranche, 2.75% per annum, in relation to the KEXIM Guaranteed Tranche, 1.50% per

Table of Contents  

annum, in relation to the KEXIM Funded Tranche, 2.60% per annum and in relation to the K-Sure Tranche, 1.70% per annum. If there is a failure to pay any amount due, interest shall accrue at a rate 2.00% higher than the interest rate that would otherwise have been applied to such amount.  

The Korean Export Credit Facility is secured on a first lien basis by a pledge of various assets, including, as of September 30, 2016, 10 VLCC vessels, as well as 5 VLCC newbuildings that will be funded by borrowings under the Korean Export Credit Facility. 

We are obligated to repay the Commercial Tranche of each loan in 20 equal consecutive quarterly installments (excluding a final balloon payment equal to 2/3 of the applicable loan) of such loan and are obligated to repay the other tranches of each loan in 48 equal consecutive quarterly installments. We are also required to prepay loans upon the occurrence of certain events, including a default under a shipbuilding contract, a sale or total loss of a vessel, and upon election by the majority lenders, upon a change of control of us.  

On October 20, 2016, we amended the Korean Export Credit Facility to modify the change of control provision in this credit facility to conform to our Amended Sinosure Credit Facility. Pursuant to this amendment, a change of control will occur if, at any time, none of (i) Peter Georgiopoulos, (ii) Gary Brocklesby or (iii) Nicolas Busch serves as a member of our board of directors. For example, since Mr. Brocklesby is not currently a member of the board of directors, a change of control would occur should Mr. Georgiopoulos and Mr. Busch both resign or be removed from the board, decline to stand for reelection or fail to be reelected to the board, die or otherwise cease to remain as the Company s directors for any reason. In the event of a change of control under the Korean Export Credit Facility, the majority of lenders may elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the loans to be immediately due and payable and, in the event of non-payment, proceed against the collateral securing such loans. The lenders under this credit facility may make this election at any time following the occurrence of a change of control. Prior to this amendment, the change of control provision provided that a change of control would occur if Mr. Georgioupoulos was no longer a member of our board of directors. Along with this amendment, certain other technical amendments were also made to the Korean Export Credit Facility.  

We are also subject to various collateral maintenance, financial and other covenants, restrictions on payments of dividends, events of default and remedies under the Korean Export Credit Facility. See    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations       Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt Financings Korean     Export Credit Facility    in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding the Korean Export Credit Facility. 

Sinosure Credit Facility  .     On December 1, 2015, we entered into the Sinosure Credit Facility to fund a portion of the remaining installment payments due under shipbuilding contracts for three VLCC newbuildings which are being built at Chinese shipyards and to refinance a credit facility. The Sinosure Credit Facility provided for term loans up to the aggregate approximate amount of $259.6 million. On June 29, 2016, the Company amended the Sinosure Credit Facility, which we refer to as the  Amended Sinosure Credit Facility,  to, among other things, include (i) Gener8 Chiotis LLC and Gener8 Miltiades LLC as owner guarantors under the Sinosure Credit Facility and (ii) two additional term loan tranches having an aggregate amount of up to approximately $125.7 million, for purposes of financing deliveries of two VLCC newbuilding vessels, the   Gener8 Chiotis   and the   Gener8 Miltiades  . The Amended Sinosure Credit Facility, provides for term loans up to the aggregate amount of approximately $385.2 million (subject to borrowing limits and other conditions set forth in the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility).  

Borrowings under each term loan will be available to be drawn at or around the time of delivery of each VLCC newbuilding funded by the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility in an amount equal to the lowest of (i) 67.5% of the contract price of such VLCC newbuilding, (ii) 67.5% of the maximum contract price of such VLCC newbuilding and (iii) 65% of the fair market value of such VLCC newbuilding tested at or around the time of delivery of such VLCC newbuilding. Our ability to utilize these funds is subject to the actual delivery of the vessel and other borrowing conditions. As of September 30, 2016, $292.1 million was outstanding under the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility, and up to $62.8 million of borrowings were available (subject to borrowing limits and conditions) to fund the delivery of one vessel, which have an aggregate of $55.5 million of remaining installment payments due prior to the delivery of the vessels. Each loan will mature on the date falling 144 months from the date of borrowing of that loan.

Table of Contents  

The Amended Sinosure Credit Facility bears interest at a rate per annum based on LIBOR plus a margin of 2.00% per annum.  If there is a failure to pay any amount due on a loan, interest shall accrue at a rate 2.00% higher than the interest rate that would otherwise have been applied to such amount. The Amended Sinosure Credit Facility is secured on a first lien basis by a pledge of various assets, including, as of September 30, 2016, five VLCC vessels, as well as 1 VLCC newbuilding that will be funded by borrowings under the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility. 

We are obligated to repay each loan in equal consecutive quarterly installments (excluding a final balloon payment equal to 20% of the applicable loan), each in an amount equal to 1 2/3% of such loan, until the loan s maturity date. On the respective maturity date, we are obligated to repay the remaining amount that is outstanding under each loan. We are also required to prepay loans upon the occurrence of certain events, including a default under a shipbuilding contract, a sale or total loss of a vessel and, upon election by The Export-Import Bank of China and one other lender, upon a change of control of us.  

We are also subject to various collateral maintenance, financial and other covenants, restrictions on payments of dividends, events of default and remedies under the Sinosure Credit Facility. See    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations     Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt Financings Sinosure Credit Facility    in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility. 

Senior Notes.    On May 13, 2014, we issued senior unsecured notes due 2020 in the aggregate principal amount of $131.6 million for proceeds of approximately $125 million (before fees and expenses), after giving effect to original issue discount. We refer to these notes as the  senior notes.  Interest on the senior notes accrues at the rate of 11.0% per annum in the form of an automatic increase in the principal amount of each outstanding senior note.  

If we at any time irrevocably elect to pay interest in cash for the remainder of the life of the senior notes, interest on the senior notes will thereafter accrue at the rate of 10.0% per annum. We are also subject to various financial and other covenants, restrictions on payments of dividends, events of default and remedies under the senior notes. See    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations     Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt Financings      Senior Notes    in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding the senior notes.   

Interest Rate Swap Agreements 

On May 2, 2016, we entered into six interest rate swap transactions, which are intended to be cash flow hedges that effectively fix the interest rates for the refinancing facility, the Korean Export Credit Facility and the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility. The interest rate swap transactions were each confirmed under an ISDA Master Agreement, as published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Associations, Inc. ( ISDA ), including the Schedule thereto and related documentation containing customary representations, warranties and covenants. We may modify or terminate any of the foregoing interest rate swap transactions or enter into additional swap transactions in accordance with their terms in the future from time to time. See   Note 11, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS,   to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 for more details about these interest rate swaps.

Dividend Policy 

We have not declared or paid any dividends since the fourth quarter of 2010. In order to pay dividends, we will be required to satisfy certain financial and other requirements under our debt instruments. 

While we currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, for use in the operation and expansion of our business, we will evaluate the option to adopt a policy to pay cash dividends from time to time. However, any future

Table of Contents  

dividend policy is subject to the discretion of our board of directors, and restrictions under our debt instruments and under Marshall Islands law. Any determination to pay or not pay cash dividends will also depend upon then-existing conditions, including our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, investment opportunities, statutory and contractual restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant. Any such determination will also be subject to review, modification or termination at any time and from time to time. In addition, Marshall Islands law generally prohibits the payment of dividends other than from surplus (retained earnings and the excess of consideration received for the sale of shares above the par value of the shares), when a company is insolvent or if the payment of the dividend would render us insolvent. 

Cash and Working Capital 

Our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $57.5 million to $100.0 million as of September 30, 2016 from $157.5 million as of December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to payments in respect of the VLCC newbuildings of $817.0 million (including capitalized interest) and the payment of $20.7 million of deferred financing costs, partially offset by the net borrowings of $477.6 million, $237.1 million of net cash provided by operating activities and $72.5 million of proceeds from the sale of the   Gener8 Consul, Genmar Victory   and   Genmar Vision   during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Working capital is current assets (inclusive of cash and cash equivalents) minus current liabilities. 

Our working capital decreased by $44.0 million to $(54.4) million as of September 30, 2016 from $(10.5) million as of December 31, 2015. Contributing to this decrease was the paydown of the refinancing facility of $48.7 million from the $72.5 million of proceeds from the sale of   Gener8 Consul  ,   Genmar Victory   and   Genmar Vision  .      The   Gener8 Consul   was classified as assets held for sale as of December 31, 2015 as the sale was finalized during the first quarter of 2016. Also contributing to the decrease in our working capital was an increase in the current portion of long-term debt of $36.6 million to $172.0 million as of September 30, 2016, compared to $135.4 million as of December 31, 2015, and the inclusion of $4.0 million of current liabilities related to the interest rate swap agreements entered into during the second quarter of 2016. The decrease in working capital was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $92.4 million to $40.8 million as of September 30, 2016 compared to $133.2 million as of December 31, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in accrued supervision and milestone payments during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and a decrease of $9.0 million in prepaid escrow deposits related to the final installment payment for the   Gener8 Apollo  . 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities.    Net cash provided by operating activities was $237.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 which resulted from net income of $61.5 million, plus non-cash charges to operations of $120.7 million, including $26.3 million of goodwill impairment, and a change in various assets and liabilities balances (adjusted to exclude non-cash or non-operating activities) of $54.8 million, including a decrease in due from charterers and in accounts payable and other current and non-current liabilities. 

Net cash provided by operating activities was $112.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 which resulted from a net income of $84.0 million, plus non-cash charges to operations of $61.1 million, offset by a change in various assets and liabilities balances (adjusted to exclude non-cash or non-operating activities) of $32.7 million, including a decrease in due from charterers and a decrease in accounts payable and other current non-current liabilities. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities.    Net cash used in investing activities was $751.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which primarily consisted of capital spending on the VLCC newbuildings (including payments of capitalized interest) of $816.1 million, partially offset by $72.5 million net proceeds from the sale of the   Gener8 Consul, Genmar Victory   and   Genmar Vision   during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Net cash used in investing activities was $187.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which primarily consisted of capital spending on the VLCC newbuildings (including payments of capitalized interest) of $201.7 million, payment of professional fees for the 2015 merger of $10.3 million and the deposit of the 2015 merger cash consideration of $1.2 million, partially offset by a cash balance acquired in connection with the consummation of the 2015 merger on May 7, 2015 of $28.9 million. 

51 

Table of Contents  

Cash Flows from Financing Activities.    Net cash provided by financing activities was $456.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which primarily consisted of net proceeds from borrowings of $477.6 million and the payment of deferred financing costs of $20.7 million related to the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility and the Korean Export Credit Facility. 

Net cash provided by financing activities was $172.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which primarily consisted of proceeds, net of underwriters  commission and other issuance costs, from the IPO of $214.5 million (excluding net proceeds resulting from the exercise of the overallotment option in July 2015), offset by net debt payments of $12.3 million and the payment of deferred financing costs of $29.8 million related to the Refinancing Facility and the Korean Export Credit Facility.  

Capital Expenditures and Drydocking 

Drydocking.    We incur expenditures to fund our drydock program of regularly scheduled in-water surveys or drydocking necessary to preserve the quality of our vessels as well as to comply with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations. Management anticipates that vessels which are younger than 15 years are required to undergo in-water surveys approximately 2.5 years after a drydock and that vessels are to be drydocked approximately every five years, while vessels 15 years or older are to be drydocked approximately every 2.5 years in which case the additional drydocks take the place of these in-water surveys. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred $2.0 million and $4.8 million, respectively, of drydock related costs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred $5.4 million and $7.6 million, respectively, of drydock related costs. Accumulated amortization as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $14.2 million and $8.8 million, respectively. 

For information regarding certain anticipated drydocking expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2016, see    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Expenditures and Drydocking Drydocking    in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Capital Improvements.    During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, we capitalized $5.1 million and $5.5 million, respectively, relating to capital projects including environmental compliance equipment upgrades, satisfying requirements of oil majors and vessel upgrades.  

The United States ratified Annex VI to the International Maritime Organization s MARPOL Convention effective in October 2008, which entered into force for the United States on January 8, 2009. This Annex relates to emission standards for Marine Engines in the areas of particulate matter, NOx and SOx, and establishes Emission Control Areas. The emission program is intended to reduce air pollution from ships by establishing a new tier of performance-based standards for diesel engines on all vessels and stringent emission requirements for ships that operate in coastal areas with air-quality problems. Annex VI includes a global cap on the sulfur content of fuel oil, and provides for stringent controls of sulfur emissions in Emission Control Areas. On October 27, 2016, the International Maritime Organization's Marine Environment Protection Committee announced the results from a vote concerning the implementation of regulations mandating a reduction in sulfur emissions from 3.5% currently to 0.5% as of the beginning of 2020 rather than pushing the deadline back to 2025. By 2020 ships will now have to either remove sulfur from emissions through the use of emission scrubbers or buy fuel with low sulfur content. All of our vessels currently comply with Marpol Annex VI emission standards by burning 0.1% low sulfur fuel in the main engine, auxiliary engines, and boilers, which has resulted in increased fuel cost when operating in the Emission Control Areas mentioned above. We currently receive additional compensation from charterers when using 0.1% low sulfur fuel. We may incur additional costs in the future depending on pricing and availability of low sulfur fuel, regulatory rule changes, or a change in the treatment of these costs by charterers, which may require modifications to the vessel or installation of scrubbers to continue to meet the required emission standards. 

Certain vessels in our fleet will require the installation of a Ballast Water Management System to meet regulatory requirements, which must be satisfied by the first scheduled dry-docking after January 1, 2016. Our capital improvements budget for the year ending December 31, 2016 mentioned below includes $9.4 million for purchase of Ballast Water Management Systems equipment.

Table of Contents  

For information regarding our capital improvements budget for the year ended December 31, 2016, see    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Expenditures and Drydocking Capital Improvements    in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

In October 2015, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling that directed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which we refer to as the  EPA,  to redraft the sections of the 2013 Vessel General Permit, which we refer to as the  VGP,  that address ballast water. However, the Second Circuit stated that 2013 VGP will remain in effect until the EPA issues a new VGP. It presently remains unclear how the ballast water requirements set forth by the EPA, the United States Coast Guard, and International Maritime Organization s Ballast Water Management Convention, some of which are in effect and some of which are pending, will co-exist. 

We are currently evaluating the possible installation of energy saving devices when dry-docking certain vessels. The installation of this equipment will be dependent on vessel age and performance, fuel pricing, and projected tanker market conditions. Our capital improvements budget for the year ending December 31, 2016 mentioned above includes approximately $0.9 million for such upgrades. 

Vessel Acquisitions and Disposals.    As a result of the 2015 merger, we acquired 14  eco  VLCC newbuildings in May 2015. In March 2014 we acquired seven  eco  VLCC newbuildings from Scorpio Tankers, Inc. We sold one Hanydmax vessel, the   Gener8 Consul  , in February 2016. 

During the third quarter of 2016, we entered into agreements for the sale of the 2001-built VLCC tankers   Genmar Vision   and   Genmar Victory   for $28.0 million and $29.0 million, respectively, in gross proceeds. The sales were completed during the third-quarter of 2016. We used the net proceeds from the sale of the   Genmar Vision   and   Genmar Victory   to repay approximately $19.4 million and $19.4 million, respectively, of the related portion of the senior secured debt outstanding under the Refinancing Facility associated with the vessels. 

As of November 14, 2016, the expected delivery dates of our four remaining VLLC newbuildings were November 2016, January 2017, February 2017 and March 2017. 

Other Commitments.    In 2004, we entered into a 15-year lease for office space in New York, New York. In July 2015, we entered into an amendment to such lease, which, among other things, extended the term of the lease for an additional 5-year period (from October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2025). The monthly rental is as follows: $0.1 million per month from July 1, 2015 to September 30, 2015; $0.1 million per month from October 1, 2015 to September 30, 2016; $0.1 million per month from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2020; and $0.2 million per month from October 1, 2020 to September 30, 2025. The monthly straight-line rental expense is approximately $0.2 million, including amortization of the lease asset recorded on May 17, 2012 associated with fresh-start accounting, for the period from May 18, 2012 to September 30, 2025. We recorded expenses associated with this lease of approximately $0.5 million and $1.5 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and approximately $0.5 million and $1.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.

We do not consider inflation to be a significant risk to the cost of doing business in the current or foreseeable future. Inflation has a moderate impact on operating expenses, drydocking expenses and corporate overhead. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparation of these statements requires management to make judgments and estimates. Some accounting policies have a significant impact on amounts reported in these condensed consolidated financial statements. Other than as described below, our critical accounting policies have not changed from those reported in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Interest Rate Risk Management  .  We are party to interest rate swaps to help to protect against changes in borrowing rates on our senior secured credit facilities and any replacement floating rate LIBOR credit facility. Upon execution of the swaps, we designated the hedges as cash flow hedges of benchmark interest rate risk under FASB ASC 815,   Derivatives and Hedging  .    See   Note 1,     basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies,   to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for further information. 

Goodwill  .  At September 30, 2016 and in accordance with ASC 350-20-35, we considered the continued decline in the fair value of our fleet independent valuations to be an indicator for goodwill impairment testing at the interim period. Accordingly, at September 30, 2016, goodwill was tested for potential impairment. As a result of the goodwill impairment test performed, it was determined that the carrying value for each reporting unit was higher than the fair value and therefore goodwill was fully impaired, which resulted in a write-off at September 30, 2016 of $23.3 million.   See   Note 1,     basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies,   to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for further information. 

Vessels Carrying Value 

The carrying value of each of our vessels does not represent the fair market value of such vessel or the amount we could obtain if we were to sell any of our vessels, which could be more or less. Under U.S. GAAP, we would not record a loss if the fair market value of a vessel (excluding its charter) is below our carrying value unless and until we determine to sell that vessel or the vessel is impaired. 

55 

Table of Contents  

Pursuant our senior secured credit facilities, we regularly submit to the lenders valuations of our vessels on an individual charter free basis in order to calculate our compliance with the collateral maintenance covenants. Such a valuation is not necessarily the same as the amount any vessel may bring upon sale, which may be more or less, and should not be relied upon as such. In the chart below, we list each of our vessels, the year it was built, the year we acquired it, and its carrying value at September 30, 2016. We have indicated by an asterisk those vessels for which the vessel valuations for covenant compliance purposes under such facilities as of the most recent compliance testing date were lower than their carrying values at September 30, 2016. The most recent compliance testing date was November 14, 2016 under such facilities for the three months ended September 30, 2016. A  t September 30, 2016, the carrying value of our newly delivered VLCC s marked with an asterisk exceeded the valuation of such vessels. The amount by which the carrying value at September 30, 2016 of these vessels exceeded the valuation of such vessels ranged, on an individual vessel basis, from $16.0 million to $28.2 million per vessel, with an average of $22.2 million.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

For information regarding recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards applicable to us, see   Note 1,     basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies,   to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 

JOBS Act 

In April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the  JOBS Act,  was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period, and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies.

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

Interest Rate Risk.      We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates. The exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our debt. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $1.0 billion of floating rate debt with a margin over LIBOR from 1.5% to 3.75%. As of December 31, 2015, we were not party to any interest rate swaps. 

On May 2, 2016, we entered into six interest rate swap transactions that effectively fix the interest rates on an initial aggregate amount of approximately $793.4 million as of September 30, 2016, and a maximum aggregate amount   

59 

Table of Contents  

of approximately $1.18 billion (based on future draws under the Korean Export Credit Facility), of our outstanding variable rate debt to fixed rates ranging from 2.797% to 4.758%. These interest rate swap transactions have effective dates ranging from May 31, 2016 to June 30, 2016. A 100 basis point (one percent) increase in LIBOR would have increased interest expense on $360.0 million of our outstanding floating rate indebtedness as of September 30, 2016 that is not hedged by approximately $3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Our anticipated draws under the Korean Export Credit Facility and Amended Sinosure Credit Facility are expected to increase our exposure to variable rate debt. This increase in exposure is expected to be p  artially offset by   the interest rate swap transactions we entered into on May 2, 2016. 

We may from time to time enter into   additional interest rate   swaps, caps or similar agreements for all or a significant portion of our remaining floating rate debt, including the refinancing facility  ,  the Korean Export   Credit Facility and the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility. Increased interest rates may increase the risk that the counterparties to our   existing and future swap agreements will default on their obligations, which could further increase our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Conversely, if interest rates are lower than our swapped fixed rates, we will be required to pay more for our debt than we would had we not entered into the swap agreements. 

Commodity Risk.    Fuel costs represent the largest component of our voyage expenses. An increase in the price of fuel may adversely affect our profitability if these increases cannot be passed onto customers. The price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates as a result of events outside our control, including geo-political developments, supply and demand for oil and gas, actions by members of OPEC and other oil and gas producers, war and unrest in oil producing countries and regions, regional production patterns and environmental concerns and regulations. We do not currently hedge our fuel costs; thus an increase in the price of fuel may adversely affect our profitability and cash flows. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, fuel costs amounted to approximately 66.4% and 52.7%, respectively, of our voyage expenses. The potential additional expenses from a 10% increase in fuel price would have been approximately $0.2 million and $0.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our  disclosure controls and procedures  (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the material information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could have significantly affected internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

PART II: OTHER INFORMATION     

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   

Genmar Progress 

In August 2007, an oil sheen was discovered and reported by shipboard personnel in the vicinity of the Genmar Progress, in Guayanilla Bay, Puerto Rico. Subsequently, the U.S. Coast Guard formally designated the Genmar Progress as a source of the pollution incident. In October 2010, the United States, GMR Progress, LLC, and General Maritime Management (Portugal) L.d.A. executed a Joint Stipulation and Settlement Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of this agreement, the United States agreed to accept $6.3 million in full satisfaction of oil spill response costs of the Coast Guard and certain natural damage assessment costs incurred through the date of settlement. The settlement had been paid in full by the vessel s protection   indemnity underwriters. 

In April 2013, the Natural Resource Trustees for the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (the  Trustees ) submitted a claim to GMR Progress, LLC and General Maritime Management (Portugal) L.d.A. for alleged injury to natural resources as a result of this oil spill, primarily seeking monetary damages in the amount of $4.9 million for both loss of beach use and compensation for injury to natural resources such as mangroves, sea grass and coral. On July 7, 2014, the Trustees presented a revised claim for $7.9 million, consisting of $0.9 million for loss of beach use, $5.0 million for injuries to mangroves, sea grass and coral and for uncompensated damage assessment costs and $2.0 million for a 35% contingency for monitoring and oversight. In October 2015, the parties reached an agreement to settle this claim for $2.8 million plus interest, which was approved by the federal court in Puerto Rico. The court order for the approval was entered on September 22, 2016. The settlement was reported to the vessel s protection   indemnity underwriters, who are expected to fund the settlement, which including accrued interest totals $2.75 million. 

General 

We have not been involved in any other legal proceedings which may have, or have had, a significant effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity, nor are we aware of any proceedings that are pending or threatened which may have a significant effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. From time to time in the future we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, principally personal injury and property casualty claims. While we expect that these claims would be covered by our existing insurance policies, those claims, even if lacking merit, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.  

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   

In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in the section entitled  Risk Factors  in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results or liquidity or future results. The risks described in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks we face.  

We recently entered into six interest rate swap transactions to hedge our exposure on a portion of our outstanding variable rate debt. However, hedging against interest rate exposure may adversely affect us. Increased interest rates may increase the risk that the counterparties to our swap agreements will default on their obligations, which could further increase our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Conversely, if interest rates are lower than our swapped fixed rates, we will be required to pay more for our debt than we would had we not entered into the swap agreements.  

In addition, below is a risk factor describing certain risks associated with our senior secured credit facilities and senior notes. 

II-1 

Table of Contents  

The covenants under our senior secured credit facilities and senior notes may be difficult to satisfy in the current market environment. 

We continue to be subject to a difficult charter rate environment which has negatively impacted our cash flow from operations and liquidity. Since we entered into the Korean Export Credit Facility and the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility, appraised values of our vessels have declined significantly, which has reduced the amounts that we are permitted to borrow pursuant to the borrowing limits and conditions under these credit facilities. Any reductions in the amounts that we are permitted to borrow under our credit facilities may negatively affect our liquidity. 

We are subject to a number of covenants under our senior notes and senior secured credit facilities, including covenants governing the minimum amount of cash and cash equivalents we maintain, our ratio of consolidated EBITDA to our aggregate scheduled principal repayments and cash interest expense for our consolidated indebtedness, and the minimum aggregate appraised value of the vessels we have pledged as collateral under our senior secured credit facilities. In the event of continued weakness in charter rates and vessel values, if the current market environment declines further or does not recover sufficiently and/or because of the potential timing of receipt of payments and required expenditures, there is a possibility that we may not comply with these covenants as the first half of 2017 absent waivers or amendments to our senior secured credit facilities or obtaining additional capital. We may not be in compliance earlier in the event of further weakness or deterioration in the markets in which we operate. To address these issues, we may require capital to fund our ongoing operations, the delivery of our VLCC newbuildings, and the service of our debt, and we may seek waivers or amendments from our lenders and/or pursue other options. Any such transactions may be subject to conditions. If market or other conditions are not favorable, we may be unable to complete any such transactions or obtain waivers or amendments from our lenders on acceptable terms or at all. 

Absent such waivers or amendments, if we do not comply with these covenants and fail to cure our non-compliance following applicable notice and expiration of applicable cure periods, we would be in default of one or more of our credit facilities. If such a default occurs, we may also be in default under our unsecured senior notes. Each of our current debt facilities contain cross default provisions that could be triggered by our failure to comply with these covenants. As a result, some or all of our indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable. We may not have sufficient assets available to satisfy our obligations. Substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral to our lenders, and our lenders may seek to foreclose on their collateral if a default occurs. We may have to seek alternative sources of financing on terms that may not be favorable to us or that may not be available at all. Therefore, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

Moreover, in the event we are in default, we will not be able to borrow additional amounts under our Korean Export Credit Facility. If we are unable to borrow under this credit facility, our ability to finance our remaining VLCC newbuildings could be materially adversely affected. If for any reason we fail to make an installment payment under our shipbuilding contracts when due, which may result in a default under our shipbuilding contracts, we would be prevented from taking delivery of the newbuilding vessels and realizing potential revenues from these vessels, we could lose all or a portion of any payments previously paid by us in respect of these vessels and we could be liable for any additional damages resulting from a breach by us of the contracts. We may also lose any equipment provided to the shipyard as buyers  supplies for installation by the shipyard on the vessels. 

Below is updated information for the risk factor entitled,    We are subject to requirements under environmental and operational safety laws, regulations and conventions that could require significant expenditures, affect our cash flows and net income and could subject us to significant liability.    

On October 27, 2016, the International Maritime Organization s Marine Environment Protection Committee announced the results from a vote concerning the implementation of regulations mandating a reduction in sulfur emissions from 3.5% currently to 0.5% as of the beginning of 2020 rather than pushing the deadline back to 2025. By 2020 ships will now have to either remove sulfur from emissions through the use of emission scrubbers or buy fuel with low sulfur content. Scrubbers can cost $3.0 million to $5.0 million to install on existing ships. If a vessel is not retrofitted with a scrubber or other emission abatement technology, it will need to use low sulfur fuel (0.5 %), which is more expensive that standard marine fuel. This increased demand for low sulfur fuel may result in an increase in prices for such fuel.

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION   

Pursuant to this Item 5 of our Quarterly Report, we are reporting information relating to the below-described acquisition of a significant amount of assets that would otherwise be required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 2.01 of a Current Report on Form 8-K. 

On November 7, 2016, Gener8 Noble LLC, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, took delivery of the   Gener8 Noble  , a 298,991 metric tons deadweight 2016-built VLCC newbuilding. We acquired this vessel pursuant to a shipbuilding contract with Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. ( HSHI ) which was entered into by Navig8 Crude Tankers, Inc. ( Navig8 Crude ) which assigned its rights on delivery to Gener8 Noble LLC as Navig8 Crude s nominee. We acquired the contract for the   Gener8 Noble   along with thirteen other shipbuilding contracts for VLCC newbuildings in May 2015 in connection with our acquisition of Navig8 Crude. Four of the fourteen shipbuilding contracts acquired from Navig8 Crude were for VLCC newbuildings under construction with HSHI, and the   Gener8 Noble   is the tenth of these fourteen newbuildings to be delivered. 

Installment payments of $28.6 million were made to HSHI under the shipbuilding contract for   Gener8 Noble   by Navig8 Crude prior to it being acquired by us in May 2015. After its acquisition of Navig8 Crude, we made $66.7 million of additional installment payments to HSHI under this shipbuilding contract. There are no further remaining installment payments due in respect of the   Gener8 Noble  . The funds we used for the installment payments in respect of the   Gener8 Noble   after our acquisition of Navig8 Crude in May 2015 included borrowings under   its senior secured credit facility agreement, dated as of August 31, 2015, among Gener8 Maritime Subsidiary VIII Inc., as borrower; the Company, as the parent guarantor; Gener8 Maritime Subsidiary V Inc., as the borrower s direct sole shareholder; the borrower s wholly-owned subsidiary owner guarantors party thereto; Citibank, N.A. and Nordea Bank Finland Plc, New York Branch, as global co-ordinators; Citibank, N.A. and Nordea Bank Finland Plc, New York Branch, as bookrunners; Citibank, N.A., London Branch as ECA co-ordinator and ECA agent; Nordea Bank Finland Plc, New York Branch as commercial tranche co-ordinator; Nordea Bank Finland Plc, New York Branch as facility agent; Nordea Bank Finland Plc, New York Branch as security agent; The Export-Import Bank of Korea; the mandated lead arrangers party thereto; the banks and financial institutions named therein as original lenders; and the banks and financial institutions named therein as hedge counterparties.
