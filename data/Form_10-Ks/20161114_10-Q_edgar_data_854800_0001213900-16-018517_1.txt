NOTE
1 - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS   

Overview    

A.
Micronet Enertec Technologies, Inc., a U.S.-based Delaware corporation, was formed on January 31, 2002. On March 14, 2013, we
changed our corporate name from Lapis Technologies, Inc. to Micronet Enertec Technologies, Inc., or we, Micronet Enertec or the
Company.  

We
operate through two Israel-based companies, Enertec Systems 2001 Ltd., or Enertec, our wholly-owned subsidiary, and Micronet Ltd.,
or Micronet, in which we held 62.9% as of September 30, 2016 and is controlled by us.  

Micronet
is a publicly traded company on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and operates in the growing commercial Mobile Resource Management,
or MRM, market. Micronet through both its Israeli and U.S. operational offices designs, develops, manufactures and sells rugged
mobile computing devices that provide fleet operators and field workforces with computing solutions in challenging work environments.
Micronet s vehicle cabin installed and portable tablets increase workforce productivity and enhance corporate efficiency
by offering computing power and communication capabilities that provide fleet operators with visibility into vehicle location,
fuel usage, speed and mileage. Micronet s customers consist primarily of application service providers and solution providers
specializing in the MRM market.  

Enertec
operates in the Defense and Aerospace markets and designs, develops, manufactures and supplies various customized military computer-based
systems, simulators, automatic test equipment and electronic instruments. Enertec s solutions and systems are designed according
to major aerospace integrators  requirements and are integrated by them into critical systems such as command and control,
missile fire control, maintenance of military aircraft and missiles for use by the Israeli Air Force and Navy and by foreign defense
entities.  

B. Standby
Equity Distribution Agreement   

On
June 30, 2016, we entered into a Standby Equity Distribution Agreement, or the SEDA, with YA II PV Ltd., or YA II, a Cayman
Island exempt limited partnership and an affiliate of Yorkville Advisors Global, LLC, for the sale of up to $2.39 million of shares
of the Company s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, over a three-year commitment period.  Under the terms of
the SEDA, the Company may from time to time, in its discretion, sell newly-issued shares of its common stock to YA II at a discount
to market of 1.5%.  The Company expects to issue shares of common stock under the SEDA pursuant to its effective Registration
Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-196760), or the Registration Statement. The Company is not obligated to
utilize any of the funds available under the SEDA and there are no minimum commitments or minimum use penalties.  The total
amount of funds that ultimately can be raised under the SEDA over the three-year term will depend on the market price for the
Company s common stock and the number of shares actually sold. The SEDA does not impose any restrictions on the Company s
operating activities. During the term of the SEDA, YA II is prohibited from engaging in any short selling or hedging transactions
related to the Company s common stock. As of September 30, 2016, the Company sold YA II an aggregate of 291,430 shares of
its common stock for an aggregate sale amount of $480 pursuant to the SEDA and under the Registration Statement. The aggregate
issuance costs amounted to $100.   

C.
Note Purchase Agreement   

On
June 30, 2016, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Enertec Electronics Ltd., entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with
YA II, or the Note Purchase Agreement, whereby YA II purchased $600 of notes from the Company, or the Notes. The Company received
a total of $600 on July 1, 2016. The outstanding principal balance of the Notes bears interest at 7% per annum. On a quarterly
basis, which commenced on October 10, 2016, the Company will make payments of $150 of principal, plus accrued interest. All amounts
payable are due on July 10, 2017. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Notes, all amounts payable may be due immediately.
In connection with the Note Purchase Agreement, the Company granted to YA II a five-year warrant, or the Warrant, to purchase
66,000 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $4.30 per share, which was amended on October 28, 2016
to $3.00 per share.   

The
Company recorded a discount amount of $33 based on the fair value of the warrant on the grant date.  

NOTE
2 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND CONSOLIDATION   

Basis
of Presentation   

The
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial statements and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article
10 of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. Accordingly, they do not contain all information
and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for annual financial statements.
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of the Company s management, the accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements contain all the adjustments necessary (consisting only of normal recurring accruals)
to present the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and the results of operations and cash flows for the
periods presented. The results of operations for the periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating
results for the full fiscal year or any future period. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company s accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and updated, as necessary, in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q.  

All
the amounts included in the notes are denominated in thousand US Dollars.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.  

Principles
of consolidation   

The
consolidated financial statements comprise the results and position of the Company and its subsidiaries. Control is the power
to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its operating activities. In assessing
control, legal and contractual rights are taken into account. The consolidated financial statements of subsidiaries are included
in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control is achieved until the date that control is ceased. Intercompany
transactions and balances are eliminated upon consolidation.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

In
January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2016-01,
Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10)or ASU 2016-01, which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement,
presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 will be effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter
of 2019. The company is currently assessing the potential impact of this ASU on the consolidated financial position and results
of operations.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, which supersedes the lease accounting guidance in ASC 840, Leases. The new guidance
requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with the exception
of short-term leases. For lessees, leases will continue to be classified as either operating or finance leases in the income statement.
Lessor accounting is similar to the current model but updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model. The guidance
is effective for reporting periods (interim and annual) beginning after December 15, 2018, for public companies, with early adoption
permitted. The new guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently assessing the potential
impact of this ASU on the consolidated financial position and results of operations.  

NOTE
2 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND CONSOLIDATION (CONT.)   

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements (Cont.)   

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, which revises the guidance in ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, and will
change how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees, including the income tax impact, classification
on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. The guidance is effective for reporting periods (interim and annual) beginning
after December 15, 2017, for public companies. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact
of this ASU on the consolidated financial position and results of operations.   

In June 2016, the FASB issued a new standard
to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current U.S. GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses
and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. For trade
and other receivables, we will be required to use a forward-looking expected loss model rather than the incurred loss model for
recognizing credit losses which reflects losses that are probable. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities
will also be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities.
The new standard will be effective beginning January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning January 1, 2019. The amendments
will be applied through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15.
This update addresses whether to present certain specific cash flow items as operating, investing or financing activities. The
amendments in this update are effective as of the first quarter of 2018; however, early adoption is permitted. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact that this will have on the consolidated financial statements. 

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16.
This update removes the current exception in U.S GAAP prohibiting entities from recognizing current and deferred income tax expenses
or benefits. related to transfer of assets, other than inventory, within the consolidated entity. The current exception to defer
the recognition of any tax impact on the transfer of inventory within the consolidated entity until it is sold to a third party
remains unaffected. The amendments in this update are effective as of the first quarter of 2018. Early adoption is permitted and
should be in the first interim period if an entity issues interim financial statements. The amendments in this ASU should be applied
on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of
the period of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on the consolidated financial statements. 

NOTE
3 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS   

The
accounting guidance establishes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to valuation used to measure fair value. This
hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows:  

Level
1   Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the
Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.  

Level
2   Observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar instruments and quoted prices in markets that are not active,
and inputs that are directly observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. The types of assets and liabilities
included in Level 2 are typically either comparable to actively traded securities or contracts, such as treasury securities
with pricing interpolated from recent trades of similar securities, or priced with models using highly observable inputs,
such as commodity options priced using observable forward prices and volatilities.  

NOTE
3 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (CONT.)   

Level
3   Significant inputs to pricing that have little or no observability as of the reporting date. The types of assets and
liabilities included in Level 3 are those with inputs requiring significant management judgment or estimation, such as the complex
and subjective models and forecasts used to determine the fair value of financial instruments.  

Items
carried at fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,are summarized below:  

NOTE
4 - INVENTORIES   

Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market, computed using the first-in, first-out method. Inventories consist of the following:  

NOTE
5 - SEGMENTS   

Operating
segments are based upon our internal organization structure, the manner in which our operations are managed and the availability
of separate financial information. We have two operating segments: a defense and aerospace segment operated by Enertec and a mobile
resource management segment operated by Micronet.  

The
following table summarizes the financial performance of our operating segments:  

(1)  
      Includes
    $694 of intangible assets amortization, derived from acquisitions.   

(2)  
      Includes
    $889 of intangible assets amortization, derived from acquisitions.   

NOTE
6 -  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS   

On October 28, 2016, the Company and its
wholly owned subsidiary, Enertec Electronics Ltd., entered into a Note Purchase Agreement, or the Subsequent Note Purchase Agreement,
with YA II, whereby YA II agreed to lend an additional $500 to the Company pursuant to a secured promissory note, or the Subsequent
Note. The outstanding principal balance of the Subsequent Note bears interest at 7% per annum. Commencing on March 20, 2017,  the
Company will make four equal quarterly payments of principal plus accrued interest on a quarterly basis.  The Subsequent
Note, along with the Notes held by YA II, is secured by a pledge of shares of Micronet Ltd. owned by Enertec Electronics Ltd.
In connection with the Subsequent Note Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to grant to YA II a five-year warrant to purchase
66,000 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $3.00 per share. 

On November 4, 2016, the Company entered
into a Settlement and Mutual Release Agreement, or the Settlement Agreement, with regard to the complaint filed by Novatel Wireless,
Inc., the Seller, on May 3, 2016 in the Superior District Court of the State of Delaware relating to the Asset Purchase Agreement
between Novatel Wireless, Inc. and the Company, dated February 18, 2016. According to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the
Company will pay the Seller a sum of $150 for the full release, settlement and discharge of the allegations made in the complaint.
As a result of the Settlement Agreement, the Company has deducted $100 from the $250 provision previously made in the financial
statements. 

Item
    2.    
       Management s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.    

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995 and other Federal securities laws, and is subject to the safe-harbor created by such Act and laws.  In
some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as  may,   will,   should, 
 expect,   intend,   plan,   anticipate,   believe,   estimate, 
 predict,   potential  or  continue,  the negative of such terms, or other variations thereon
or comparable terminology.  The statements herein and their implications are merely predictions and therefore inherently
subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause actual results, performance levels
of activity, or our achievements, or industry results to be materially different from those contemplated by the forward-looking
statements.  Such forward-looking statements appear in this Item 2    Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  and may appear elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q

    of research and development costs in the future;   

Continuing
    control of at least a majority of Micronet's share capital;   

The
    organic and non-organic growth of our business;    

Our
    financing needs; and   

The
    sufficiency of our capital resources.   

Our
business and operations are subject to substantial risks, which increase the uncertainty inherent in the forward-looking statements
contained or implied in this report.  Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking
statements to reflect actual results or changes in factors or assumptions affecting such forward-looking statements. Further information
on potential factors that could affect our business is described under the heading  Risk Factors  in Part I, Item
1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.  Readers are also urged to carefully
review and consider the various disclosures we have made in that report. The following discussion and analysis should be read
in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q.   

Overview   

We
operate primarily through two Israel-based companies, Enertec our wholly-owned subsidiary, and Micronet in which
we have a controlling interest, which  develop, manufacture, integrate and globally market rugged computers, tablets
and computer-based systems and instruments for the commercial, defense and aerospace markets. Our products, solutions and services
are designed to perform in severe environments and battlefield conditions.  

Micronet
is a publicly-traded company on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and operates in the growing commercial MRM market and is a global
developer, manufacturer and provider of mobile computing platforms, designed for integration into fleet management and mobile
workforce management solutions. In June 2014, Micronet expanded its MRM business and operations in the U.S. market through the
acquisition of a vehicle business, or the Vehicle Business, for $7.1 million, and as a result adding to its business U.S.-based
facilities which include manufacturing and technical support infrastructure, sales and marketing capabilities as well as expanding
its U.S. customer base and presence with local fleets and local MRM service providers. As a result of this acquisition, Micronet
currently operates via its Israeli and U.S. facilities, the first located in Azur, Israel, near Tel Aviv, and the second located
in Salt Lake City, Utah.  

Enertec
operates in the defense and aerospace markets and designs, develops, manufactures and supplies various customized military computer-based
systems, simulators, automatic test equipment and electronic instruments. Enertec s solutions and systems are designed according
to major aerospace integrators  requirements and market technological needs and are integrated by them into critical systems
such as command and control, missile fire control, maintenance of military aircraft and missiles for use by the Israeli Air Force,
Israeli Navy and by foreign defense entities.  

Our
strategy is driven and focused on continued internal growth through diligent efforts in our traditional growing markets with new
technologies and innovative systems and products as well as the development of new potential segments and markets. Concurrent
with our efforts to grow organically and in line with our strategy, we will continue to seek acquisitions that will complement
and expand our product offerings, support our goals and increase our competitiveness. In order to help achieve our internal growth,
we have expanded our production capacity and facilities. The acquisition of Micronet in September 2012 served our strategy to
grow our business, and we believe that Micronet and its research and development, proprietary know-how and manufacturing capabilities
will assist us in expanding our capability to provide turnkey solutions of computer based complex systems and solutions for commercial
defense and aerospace applications as well. We strongly believe that by utilizing Micronet as our commercial arm we will be able
to access new market segments and new customers, thereby increase our overall customer base. Our current target markets, in which
we concentrate the majority of our resources, include primarily the US market, the Israeli domestic market and the European market.  

On
February 18, 2016, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, or the Asset Purchase Agreement, with Novatel Wireless, Inc.,
or the Seller, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire certain assets and liabilities of the Seller used in the operation of its
telematics hardware business, or the Telematics Business Acquisition. The Asset Purchase Agreement provided that the Telematics
Business Acquisition would close on or before March 31, 2016, subject to certain extensions and termination provisions. 
On April 11, 2016, the Seller notified us that it was terminating the Asset Purchase Agreement due to the failure to meet such
closing deadline and certain conditions required to extend it, and demanded a termination fee equal to $250 thousand pursuant
to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement. On May 3, 2016, the Seller filed a complaint in the Superior District Court of the
State of Delaware naming us as the defendant. On November 4, 2016, we entered into a Settlement and Mutual Release Agreement
or the Settlement Agreement with regard to the complaint filed by Novatel Wireless, Inc., the Seller. According to the terms of
the Settlement Agreement, we will pay the Seller a sum of $150 for the full release, settlement and discharge of the allegations
made in the complaint. As a result of the Settlement Agreement, the Company has deducted $100 from the $250 provision previously
made in our financial statements.

profit decreased by $67 and $15, to $1,055 and $4,692, and represents 20% and 25% of the revenues for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, respectively. This is in comparison to gross profit of $1,122 and $4,707 which represented 20%
and 28% of the revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The changes are due to different product mixes
and write offs of slow moving inventory.  

Micronet s
gross profit changed from 28% and 33% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 20% and 29% for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. The changes are mainly due to different product mixes and write offs of slow moving

September 30, 2016 were $1,323 and $3,977, respectively, compared to $1,169 and $3,407 for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015, respectively. This represents an increase of $154 and $570, or 13% and 17%, for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, respectively. The increases are mainly due to a $150 provision relating to the Novatel Wireless, Inc. lawsuit and an
increase in consultant and business development fees and travel expenses.  

Research
and Development Costs   

Research
and development costs are part of operating expenses. Research and development costs, which include mainly wages, materials
and sub-contractors, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $476 and $1,859, respectively, as compared to

30, 2015 respectively. The increase in loss from operations is a result of the $150 provision and a decrease in the gross profit
as described above.  

Financial
Expenses, net   

Financial
expenses, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $151 and $412, compared to expenses of $156 and $417

Non-GAAP
Financial Measures   

In
addition to providing financial measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or GAAP, we provide
additional financial metrics that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, or non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses non-GAAP
financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods,
for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes and to evaluate our financial performance.  

Management
believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons
and analysis of trends in our business, as they exclude expenses and gains that are not reflective of our ongoing operating results.
Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding
and evaluating our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results
across accounting periods and to those of peer companies.  

The
non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of our GAAP financial results and should only be used as a supplement
to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP.  

The
non-GAAP adjustments, and the basis for excluding them from non-GAAP financial measures, are outlined below:  

Amortization
    of acquired intangible assets  - We are required to amortize the intangible assets, included in our GAAP financial statements,
    related to our acquisitions of Micronet in September 2012 and the Vehicle Business of Beijer Electronics Inc. in June 2014.
    The amount of an acquisition s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and term of its related amortization are
    unique to these transactions. The amortization of acquired intangible assets are non-cash charges. We believe that such charges
    do not reflect our operational performance. Therefore, we exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets to provide investors
    with a consistent basis for comparing pre- and post-transaction operating results.   

Stock-based
    compensation  - The share based awards granted to certain individuals. They are non-cash and affected by our historical
    stock prices which are irrelevant to forward-looking analyses and are not necessarily linked to our operational performance.   

Amortization
    of note discount -  These expenses are non-cash and are related to amortization of discount of the Note Purchase Agreement
    with YA II. Such expenses do not reflect our on-going operations.   

The
following table reconciles, for the periods presented, GAAP net loss attributable to Micronet Enertec to non-GAAP net loss attributable
to Micronet Enertec and GAAP loss per share attributable to Micronet Enertec to non-GAAP net loss per share attributable to Micronet

The
Company finances its operations through current revenues, loans and securities offerings.  The
loans are divided into bank loans, a loan from Meydan Family Trust No 3, or Meydan, as described below, and loans from  YA
II .   

As
of September 30, 2016, our total cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities balance was $10,362 (of
which marketable securities amounted to $3,852), as compared to $12,139 (of which marketable securities amounted to $5,643) as
of December 31, 2015. This reflects a decrease of $1,777 in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities.
The decrease in cash and cash equivalents is primarily a result of our net loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

On
September 2, 2015, Enertec entered into a Credit Line Agreement, or the Credit Line Agreement, with a financing firm, or the Financing

to the terms of the FIBI Loan Agreement, $2,425 of the loan bears interest at a quarterly adjustable rate of Prime plus 1.5 percent
(3.75% percent as of the date of the loan), or the Long Term Portion. The Long Term Portion plus interest is due and payable in

beginning on August 29, 2014. The loan is secured mainly by a floating charge against Micronet s assets and a mortgage on
a building owned by Micronet. The loan is subject to customary covenants, terms, conditions, events of default and certain pre-payment
provisions. 

As
of September 30, 2016, the balance on this loan (the Long Term Portion and the Short Term Portion) was approximately $2,834 and
the interest rates were Prime plus 1.2% and Prime plus 1.5% for the Short Term Portion and the Long Term Portion, respectively.

Pursuant
to the terms of the Mercantile Loan Agreement: (1) approximately $3,050 of the Mercantile Loan bears interest at a quarterly adjustable

Portion is due and payable in ten equal consecutive annual installments beginning at January 1, 2015. The Mercantile Short Term
Portion in the amount of approximately $581 bears interest of Prime plus 1.7%. The Mercantile Loan is secured mainly by (1) a
negative pledge on Enertec s assets, (2) a pledge of Enertec s financial deposits which shall be equal to 25% of Enertec s
outstanding credit balance, and (3) a fixed charge of Micronet shares at such value equal to at least 200% of the outstanding
net balance of the Mercantile Loan. The Mercantile Loan is subject to customary covenants, terms, conditions, events of default
and certain pre-payment provisions. As of September 30, 2016, the balance on the Mercantile Loan was $2,226 and the interest rates

Pursuant
to the terms of the Mercantile Loan Agreement, Enertec agreed to grant Mercantile Bank a five-year Phantom Stock Option, or the
Phantom Stock Option, pursuant to which Mercantile Bank is entitled to participate in the future appreciation of the Company s
shares and receive a cash amount equal to the increase in the value of the shares underlying the Phantom Stock Option on certain

to purchase 1,144,820 shares of Micronet, or the Option Shares, and to receive a cash amount equal to the difference between approximately
NIS 4,000, (representing 110 percent of the average market value of Micronet Option Shares during the 30 trading days prior to
the date of the Mercantile Loan) and the actual market price of such Option Shares on the date of the exercise of the Phantom
Stock Option. Pursuant to the Mercantile Loan Agreement, the parties further agreed that the potential gain to Mercantile Bank
resulting from the Phantom Stock Option shall not exceed NIS 3,000. In the event the Mercantile Loan is repaid prior to the third
anniversary of the Mercantile Loan, the gain to Mercantile Bank resulting from the Phantom Stock Option shall not exceed NIS 2,000.
As of the date of the Mercantile Loan the exercise price of the Phantom Stock Options is higher than the market price of the Option
Shares. As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of this Phantom Stock Option was $4.  

In addition ,
 on June 30, 2016, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Enertec Electronics Ltd.,
entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with YA II, or the Note Purchase Agreement, whereby YA II purchased $600 of notes from
the Company, or the Notes. The Company received a total of $600 on July 1, 2016. The outstanding principal balance of the Notes

As
of September 30, 2016, our total current assets were $31,495, as compared to $ 33,534  at
December 31, 2015. The decrease is mainly due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and a decrease
in inventory.  

Our
trade accounts receivable at September 30, 2016 were $13,326 as compared to  $12,353  at
December 31, 2015. The increase is primarily due to increase in revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

As
of September 30, 2016, our working capital was $10,391, as compared to  $13,291  at
December 31, 2015. The decrease in the working capital is primarily due to the decrease in cash and cash equivalents and due to
an increase in short- term bank loans.  

As
of September 30, 2016, our total debt was $16,330 as compared to $ 14,402  at December
31, 2015.  

Our
bank and other debt is composed of short-term loans amounting to $15,056 as of September 30, 2016 compared to $ 12,049
 at December 31, 2015, and long-term loans amounting to $1,274 as of September 30, 2016 compared to $ 2,353
 at December 31, 2015. The increase in short-term loans caused an increase in the restricted cash that stands as a collateral
for those loans.  

Our
debt includes our bank debt described above, a working capital credit facility -  a loan
from Meydan, the Credit Line Agreement and the YA II loans :  

Our
    bank debt is composed of short-term loans to Enertec Electronics Ltd., Enertec and Micronet amounting to $13,293 as of
    September 30, 2016 compared to $11,012 at December 31, 2015, and long-term loans amounting to $1,074 as of September 30, 2016
    compared to $1,978 at December 31, 2015.  The short-term loans bear interest rates between Israeli prime (currently
    1.60%) plus 0.7% to 2.45%.  The long-term loans have maturity dates between July 2018 and July 2019 and bear interest
    rates between Israeli Prime plus 1.25% to 2.45%.    

Enertec
     has covenanted under its bank loans at June 30 and December 31 of each year, among other things that
(1) its shareholder s equity according to its financial statements will not fall below NIS 17,000, and (2) its shareholder s
equity will not be lower than 30% of the total liabilities on its balance sheet.  Enertec has not met all of its bank covenants
as of September 30, 2016. As a result the Company reclassified its loans from long-term to short-term liabilities and is currently
negotiating with the bank. The Company does not presently believe that the breach of the financial covenant as of September 30,
2016 will have a material adverse effect on the Company.   

Enertec
    Electronics has covenanted under its bank loan mainly that the Company will present separate financial statements equity of
    not less than 32.5% of total assets.    

In
                                         addition, Micronet has undertaken under its bank loan documents the following primary
                                         financial covenants: (1) the aggregate amount of deposits and marketable securities will
                                         not be less than 85% of the aggregate amount of the loans; (2) a minimum equity of NIS
                                         30,000 and (3) total solvency ratio of not less than 30. 

On
        September 2, 2015, Enertec entered into a Credit Line Agreement with the Financing Firm, pursuant to which the Financing
        Firm agreed to grant Enertec a credit line for the financing of certain payables of Enertec. The maximum aggregate
        amount of the financing eligible under the Credit Line Agreement is $675 and up to 85% of each invoice. The financing
        pursuant to the Credit Line Agreement is at an annual rate of Prime plus 1.75%. On June 2, 2016 the Credit Line Agreement
        was extended and will expire on April 30, 2017. As of September 30, 2016, Enertec had financed $578 pursuant to the Credit
        Line Agreement.  

On
    June 30, 2016, we and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Enertec Electronics Ltd., entered into the Note Purchase Agreement with
    YA II, whereby YA II agreed to purchase $600 of notes from the Borrowers.  The outstanding principal balance of
    the Notes bear interest at 7% per annum. On a quarterly basis commencing on October 10, 2016, the Borrowers are required to
    make payments of $150 of principal plus accrued interest.  All amounts payable are due on July 10, 2017. Upon the

    balance of the Subsequent Note bears interest at 7% per annum. The Borrowers have agreed to make payments of $125 from the
    principal balance of the Subsequent Note plus all accrued and unpaid interest on each of March 20, 2017, June 20, 2017, September
    20, 2017 and November 20, 2017. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Subsequent Note, all amounts payable
    may be due immediately.     

Financing
Needs   

Although
we currently do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures, we expect our capital requirements to increase over
the next several years as we continue to support the organic and non-organic growth of our business. Among other activities, we
plan to develop, manufacture and market larger-scale solutions, support our growing manufacturing and finance needs, continue
the development and testing of our suite of products and systems, increase management, marketing and administration infrastructure,
and embark on developing in-house business capabilities and facilities. Our future liquidity and capital funding requirements
will depend on numerous factors, including but not limited to (1) the levels and costs of our research and development initiatives,
(2) the cost of hiring, training and certifying additional highly skilled professionals (mainly engineers and technicians),
and maintaining our management including sales and marketing personnel to promote our products, and (3) the cost and timing
of the expansion of our development, manufacturing and marketing efforts.  

The
Company expects to pay off the current portion of certain bank loans in the amount $1,187 and the amount of $1,184   to
others  using its cash flow from operations or possibly additional debt or equity financings.

On June 30, 2016, we entered into the
SEDA, with YA II, for the sale of up to $2.39 million of shares of the Company s common stock, par value $0.001 per share,
over a three-year commitment period.  Under the terms of the SEDA, we may from time to time, in our discretion, sell newly-issued
shares of our common stock to YA II at a discount to market of 1.5%. We expect to issue shares of common stock under the
SEDA pursuant to our effective Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-196760), or the Registration
Statement. We are not obligated to utilize any of the funds available under the SEDA and there are no minimum commitments or minimum
use penalties.  The total amount of funds that ultimately can be raised under the SEDA over the three-year term will depend
on the market price for our common stock and the number of shares actually sold. The SEDA does not impose any restrictions on
our operating activities. During the term of the SEDA, YA II is prohibited from engaging in any short selling or hedging transactions
related to our common stock. 

As noted above, we  have an effective
Form S-3 registration statement, filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with the Securities and Exchange
Commission using a  shelf  registration process. Under this shelf registration process, we may, from time to
time, sell common stock, warrants or units in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of $30,000, of which $2,390
has been reserved for shares to be issued pursuant to the SEDA.

on our current business plan, we anticipate that our existing cash balances and cash generated from future sales will be sufficient
to permit us to conduct our operations and to carry out our contemplated business plans for the next twelve months. However, we
believe that we may need to raise additional funds if we want to materially decrease our dependence on our existing cash
and other liquidity resources. Currently, the only external sources of liquidity are our banks, and we may seek additional financing
from them or through securities offerings, to expand our operations, using new capital to develop new products, enhance existing
products or respond to competitive pressures. However, we may also undertake additional debt or equity financings (including sales
of common stock, warrants or units under our shelf registration statement) to better enable us to grow and meet our future operating
and capital requirements. There is no assurance that we will be able to consummate such offerings on favorable terms or at all.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect that is material
to investors on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Pursuant
to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), the Company carried
out an evaluation with the participation of the Company s management, including Mr. David Lucatz, the Company s Chief
Executive Officer, and Mrs. Moran Amran, the Company s controller  (our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, respectively) , of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2016. Based upon
that evaluation, the Company s  principal executive officer and principal financial
officer  concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s  principal
executive officer and principal financial officer , as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Changes
in internal control over financial reporting   

No
change occurred in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarterly period ended September 30,
2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial
reporting.  

PART
II- OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
    1.    
       Legal
    Proceedings.     

On February 18, 2016, we entered into an Asset
Purchase Agreement, or the Asset Purchase Agreement, with Novatel Wireless, Inc., or the Seller, pursuant to which we agreed to
acquire certain assets and liabilities of the Seller used in the operation of its telematics hardware business, or the Telematics
Business Acquisition. The Asset Purchase Agreement provided that the Telematics Business Acquisition would close on or before
March 31, 2016, subject to certain extensions and termination provisions.  On April 11, 2016, the Seller notified us that
it was terminating the Asset Purchase Agreement due to the failure to meet such closing deadline and certain conditions required
to extend it, and demanded a termination fee equal to $250 thousand pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement. On
May 3, 2016, the Seller filed a complaint in the Superior District Court of the State of Delaware naming us as the defendant.
On November 4, 2016, we entered into a Settlement and Mutual Release Agreement or the Settlement Agreement with regard to the
complaint filed the Seller. According to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, we will pay the Seller a sum of $150 thousand
for the full release, settlement and discharge of the allegations made in the complaint. As a result of the Settlement Agreement,
we deducted $100 thousand from the $250 thousand provision previously made in our financial statements.

    for the Registrant and have:   

a)

b)  
      designed

    in this report any change in the Registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Registrant s
    most recent fiscal quarter (the Registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially
    affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Registrant s internal control over financial reporting;
    and   

5.  
      The Registrant s other certifying officer(s)
    and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the Registrant s
    auditors and the audit committee of the Registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):    

a)  
      all
    significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
    are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
    information; and   

b)  
      any
    fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Registrant s
    internal control over financial reporting.
