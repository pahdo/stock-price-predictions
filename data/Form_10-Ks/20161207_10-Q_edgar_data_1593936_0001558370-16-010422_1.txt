NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

(Unaudited) 

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

All expressions of the  Company ,  us ,  we ,  our , and all similar expressions are references to The Michaels Companies, Inc. and our consolidated, wholly-owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires. Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Michaels Companies, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  

On February 2, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Lamrite West, Inc. and certain of its affiliates and subsidiaries ( Lamrite ) for $150.0 million, prior to certain purchase price adjustments, utilizing our cash on hand. Lamrite operates an international wholesale business under the Darice brand name ( Darice ) and 35 arts and crafts retail stores, located primarily in Ohio and the surrounding states, under the Pat Catan s brand name ( Pat Catan s ). See Note 11 for further information. 

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Therefore, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) pursuant to section 13 or 15(d) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals and other items) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. 

We report on the basis of a 52- or 53-week fiscal year, which ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. All references to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year began. References to  fiscal 2016  relate to the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2017 and references to  fiscal 2015  relate to the 52 weeks ended January 30, 2016. In addition, all references to  the third quarter of fiscal 2016  relate to the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and all references to  the third quarter of fiscal 2015  relate to the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2015. Finally, all references to  the nine months ended October 29, 2016  relate to the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and all references to  the nine months ended October 31, 2015  relate to the 39 weeks ended October 31, 2015. Because of the seasonal nature of our business, the results of operations for the 13 and 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016 are not indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year.  

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified in the accompanying consolidated financial statements to conform to our fiscal 2016 presentation, including the reclassification of current deferred income taxes to non-current deferred income taxes and the reclassification of certain unamortized debt issuance costs from non-current assets to a direct reduction of the related long-term debt obligation as a result of new accounting standards adopted in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. 

Share Repurchase Program 

In March 2016, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase $200.0 million of the Company s common stock on the open market. The share repurchase program does not have an expiration date, and the timing and number of repurchase transactions under the program will depend on market conditions, corporate considerations, debt agreements and regulatory requirements. Shares repurchased under the program are held as treasury shares until retired. As of October 29, 2016, we have repurchased 5.9 million shares for an aggregate amount of $156.5 million. In December 2016, the Board of Directors revised the existing share repurchase program and authorized the Company to purchase an

additional $300.0 million of the Company s common stock, increasing the total amount of availability under the share repurchase program to $343.5 million.  

Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted 

In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-05,    Intangibles   Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement    ( ASU 2015-05 ). ASU 2015-05 provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. The new guidance does not change the accounting for a customer s accounting for service contracts. We adopted ASU 2015-05 in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and its adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted  

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16,    Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory    ( ASU 2016-16 ). ASU 2016-16 requires entities to recognize income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. ASU 2016-16 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the new standard but do not anticipate a material impact to the consolidated financial statements once implemented. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,    Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments    ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 clarifies how companies should present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the new standard but do not anticipate a material impact to the consolidated financial statements once implemented. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,    Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting    ( ASU 2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-09 will have on the consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-04,    Liabilities   Extinguishment of Liabilities (Subtopic 405-20): Recognition of Breakage for Certain Prepaid Stored-Value Products    ( ASU 2016-04 ). ASU 2016-04 requires that breakage on prepaid stored-value product liabilities (for example, prepaid gift cards) be accounted for consistent with the breakage guidance in Topic 606:   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . ASU 2016-04 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted. This standard is to be applied either using a modified retrospective approach or retrospectively to each period presented. We have evaluated the new standard and it will not have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements once implemented. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   "Leases (Topic 842)"   ("ASU 2016-02"). Under ASU 2016-02, an entity will be required to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet and disclose key

Table of Contents  

information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 offers specific accounting guidance for a lessee, a lessor and sale and leaseback transactions. Lessees and lessors are required to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about leasing arrangements to enable a user of the financial statements to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted. At adoption, this update will be applied using a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-02 will have on the consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers    ( ASU 2014-09 ). ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in    Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)   , and requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08  ,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)    ( ASU 2016-08 ) which is intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing    ( ASU 2016-10 ) which provides further guidance on identifying performance obligations and improves the operability and understandability of the licensing implementation guidance. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients    ( ASU 2016-12 ) which narrowly amended the revenue recognition guidance regarding collectability, noncash consideration, presentation of sales tax and transition. The guidance under these standards is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. These standards are to be applied retrospectively, with early application permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. We are currently evaluating the new standards but do not anticipate a material impact to the consolidated financial statements once implemented. 

2. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

As defined in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 820,   Fair Value Measurements   ( ASC 820 ), fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value measurements. These valuation techniques are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect less transparent active market data, as well as internal assumptions. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: 

Level 1 Quoted prices for   identical   instruments in active markets;     

Level 2 Quoted prices for   similar   instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose significant inputs are observable; and     

Level 3 Instruments with significant unobservable inputs.     

The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates their estimated fair values due to the short maturities of these instruments.

The table below provides the carrying and fair values of our Amended Term Loan Credit Facility (as defined in Note 3) and our 5.875% senior subordinated notes maturing in 2020 ( 2020 Senior Subordinated Notes ) as of October 29, 2016. The fair values of our Amended Term Loan Credit Facility and our 2020 Senior Subordinated Notes were determined based on quoted market prices which are considered Level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy. 

3. DEBT 

Long-term debt consists of the following (in thousands): 

Term Loan Credit Facility 

On September 28, 2016, Michaels Stores, Inc. ( MSI ) entered into an amendment with Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch and other lenders to amend and restate our term loan credit facility. The amended and restated credit agreement, together with the related security, guarantee and other agreements, is referred to as the  Amended Term Loan Credit Facility . The Amended Term Loan Credit Facility matures on January 28, 2023 and provides for senior secured financing of $2,269.7 million, the outstanding principal amount of the term loan credit facility at the time of the amendment. MSI has the right under the Amended Term Loan Credit Facility to request additional term loans (a) in the aggregate amount of up to $750.0 million or (b) at MSI s election, an amount of additional term loans if the consolidated secured debt ratio (as defined in the Amended Term Loan Credit Facility) is no more than 3.25 to 1.00 as of the last day of the most recently ended four quarter period, subject to certain adjustments. The lenders under the Amended Term Loan Credit Facility will not be under any obligation to provide any such additional term loans. Our obligations under the Amended Term Loan Credit Facility are secured by a second priority security interest in the current assets of the borrowers and facility guarantors and a first priority security interest in all other assets, subject to certain exceptions.  

Borrowings under the Amended Term Loan Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum, at MSI s option, of either (a) a margin of 1.75% plus a base rate defined as the highest of (1) the prime rate of Deutsche Bank, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, and (3) the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus 1% or (b) a margin of 2.75% plus the applicable LIBOR. Subsequent to the first fiscal quarter following the amendment, the applicable margin will be 1.50% for base rate loans and 2.50% for LIBOR loans if our consolidated secured debt ratio is below 1.50:1.00 for the applicable quarter. 

There are no limitations on dividends and certain other restricted payments so long as (a) no event of default shall have occurred and be continuing and (b) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such restricted payment(s) and the application of proceeds therefrom, the consolidated total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 3.75 to 1.00.

Revolving Credit Facility 

On May 27, 2016, MSI entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and other lenders to amend various terms of our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility ( Restated Revolving Credit Facility ). The amended credit agreement, together with the related security, guarantee and other agreements, is referred to as the  Amended Revolving Credit Facility . The Amended Revolving Credit Facility provides for senior secured financing of up to $850.0 million, subject to a borrowing base. We have the right to request up to $200.0 million of additional commitments under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, although the lenders are not obligated to provide any such additional commitments. The borrowing base under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility equals the sum of: (i) 90% of eligible credit card receivables, (ii) 85% of eligible trade receivables, (iii) 90% to 92.5% of the appraised value of eligible inventory, plus (iv) 90% to 92.5% of the lesser of (a) the appraised value of eligible inventory supported by letters of credit, and (b) the face amount of the letters of credit, less (v) certain reserves. The Amended Revolving Credit Facility matures in May 2021, subject to a springing maturity date if certain of our outstanding indebtedness has not been repaid, redeemed, refinanced, cash collateralized or if the necessary availability reserves have not been established prior to such time. Our obligations under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility are secured by (subject to certain exceptions) a first priority security interest in the current assets of the borrowers and facility guarantors and a second priority security interest in all other assets. 

As of October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, the borrowing base under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility was $850.0 million and $650.0 million, respectively, of which MSI had unused borrowing capacity of $792.7 million and $586.7 million, respectively. As of October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, outstanding standby letters of credit, which reduce our borrowing base, totaled $57.3 million and $63.3 million, respectively. There were no outstanding borrowings under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility as of October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015.  

Debt Issuance Costs 

Accumulated amortization of debt issuance costs was $62.4 million, $61.0 million and $59.7 million as of October 29, 2016, January 30, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively.  

4. ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS 

The following table includes detail regarding changes in the composition of accumulated other comprehensive loss (in thousands): 

5. INCOME TAXES 

The effective tax rate was 29.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and 37.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended October 29, 2016 was 33.6% compared to 36.9% in the same period in the prior year. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and the nine months ended October 29, 2016 is lower than the same periods in the prior year primarily due to benefits realized associated with our direct sourcing initiatives implemented in the current year, certain federal tax credits recognized and a decrease in state taxes.

6.   EARNINGS PER SHARE 

The Company s unvested restricted stock awards contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and meet the criteria of a participating security as defined by ASC 260,    Earnings Per Share  .  Under the two-class method, net income per share is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. In applying the two-class method, net income is allocated to both common and participating securities based on their respective weighted-average shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average common shares outstanding plus the potential dilutive impact from the exercise of stock options and restricted stock units. Common equivalent shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is anti-dilutive. There were 2.7 million and 0.9 million anti-dilutive shares during the third quarters of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. There were 2.0 million and 0.5 million anti-dilutive shares during the nine months ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively.   

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (in thousands, except per share data):

7. SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION 

We consider Michaels-U.S., Michaels-Canada, Aaron Brothers, Pat Catan s and Darice to be our operating segments for purposes of determining reportable segments based on the criteria of ASC 280,   Segment Reporting   ( ASC 280 ). We determined that Michaels-U.S., Michaels-Canada, Aaron Brothers and Pat Catan s have similar economic characteristics and meet the aggregation criteria set forth in ASC 280. Therefore, we combine these operating segments into one reporting segment. Darice does not meet the materiality criteria in ASC 280 and, therefore, is not disclosed as a reportable segment.  

Our net sales by country are as follows (in thousands): 

Our chief operating decision makers evaluate historical operating performance and forecast future periods  operating performance based on operating income and earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and losses on early extinguishments of debt and refinancing costs ( EBITDA (excluding losses on early extinguishments of debt and refinancing costs) ). We believe these metrics more closely reflect the operating effectiveness of factors over which management has control. A reconciliation of EBITDA (excluding losses on early extinguishments of debt and refinancing costs) to net income is presented below (in thousands): 

8. CONTINGENCIES 

Rea Claim 

On September 15, 2011, MSI was served with a lawsuit filed in the California Superior Court in and for the County of Orange ( Superior Court ) by four former store managers as a class action proceeding on behalf of themselves and certain former and current store managers employed by MSI in California. The lawsuit alleged that MSI improperly classified its store managers as exempt employees and as such failed to pay all wages, overtime and waiting time penalties and failed to provide accurate wage statements. The lawsuit also alleged that the foregoing conduct was in breach of various laws, including California s unfair competition law. On December 3, 2013, the Superior Court entered an order certifying a class of approximately 200 members. MSI successfully removed the case to the United States District Court for the Central District of California and on May 8, 2014, the class was decertified. The named plaintiffs  claims were resolved in September 2014, but the individual claims of 25 former class members remain pending in the Central District of California.  In addition, a separate representative action brought on behalf of store managers throughout the state is

pending in the California Superior Court, County of San Diego. We believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously. We do not believe the resolution of the lawsuits will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.   

Fair Credit Reporting Claim 

On December 11, 2014, MSI was served with a lawsuit,   Christina Graham v. Michaels Stores, Inc.  , filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey by a former employee. The lawsuit is a purported class action, bringing plaintiff s individual claims, as well as claims on behalf of a putative class of applicants who applied for employment with Michaels through an online application, and on whom a background check for employment was procured. The lawsuit alleges that MSI violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the New Jersey Fair Credit Reporting Act by failing to provide the proper disclosure and obtain the proper authorization to conduct background checks. Since the initial filing, another named plaintiff joined the lawsuit, which was amended in February 2015,   Christina Graham and Gary Anderson v. Michaels Stores, Inc.  , with substantially similar allegations. The plaintiffs seek statutory and punitive damages as well as attorneys  fees and costs. 

Following the filing of the   Graham   case in New Jersey, five additional purported class action lawsuits with six plaintiffs were filed,   Michele Castro and Janice Bercut v. Michaels Stores, Inc.  , in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas,   Michelle Bercut v. Michaels Stores, Inc.   in the Superior Court of California for Sonoma County,   Raini Burnside v. Michaels Stores, Inc.  , in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri,   Sue Gettings v. Michaels Stores, Inc  ., in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, and   Barbara Horton v. Michaels Stores, Inc.,   in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. All of the plaintiffs alleged violations of the FCRA. In addition, the   Castro, Horton   and   Janice Bercut   lawsuits also alleged violations of California s unfair competition law. The   Burnside, Horton   and   Gettings   lawsuits, as well as the claims by Michele Castro, have been dismissed. The   Graham, Janice Bercut   and   Michelle Bercut   lawsuits were transferred for centralized pretrial proceedings to the District of New Jersey. 

The Company intends to defend the remaining lawsuits vigorously. We cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss, or range of loss, related to the lawsuits, if any. 

Data Security Incident 

Five putative class actions were filed against MSI relating to the January 2014 data breach. The plaintiffs generally alleged that MSI failed to secure and safeguard customers  private information including credit and debit card information, and as such, breached an implied contract and violated the Illinois Consumer Fraud Act (and other states  similar laws). The plaintiffs are seeking damages including declaratory relief, actual damages, punitive damages, statutory damages, attorneys  fees, litigation costs, remedial action, pre and post judgment interest, and other relief as available. The cases are as follows:   Christina Moyer v. Michaels Stores, Inc  .,     was filed on January 27, 2014;   Michael and Jessica Gouwens v. Michaels Stores, Inc.,   was filed on January 29, 2014;   Nancy Maize and Jessica Gordon v. Michaels Stores, Inc  .,     was filed on February 21, 2014; and   Daniel Ripes v.

On March 18, 2014, an additional putative class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York,   Mary Jane Whalen v. Michaels Stores, Inc.  , but was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff on April 11, 2014 without prejudice to her right to re file a complaint. On April 16, 2014, an order was entered consolidating the Illinois actions. On July 14, 2014, the Company s motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint was granted.  

On December 2, 2014, Whalen filed a new lawsuit against MSI related to the data breach in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York,   Mary Jane Whalen v.

appeal on January 27, 2016, appealing the judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The appeal is pending. 

The Company intends to defend this lawsuit vigorously. We cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss, or range of loss, related to the lawsuit, if any. 

Consumer Product Safety Commission Claim 

On April 21, 2015, the United States Department of Justice, on behalf of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the  CPSC ), filed a complaint against MSI and Michaels Stores Procurement Company, Inc. ( MSPC ) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The complaint seeks civil penalties for an alleged failure to timely report a potential product safety hazard to the CPSC related to the breakage of certain glass vases. The complaint also alleges the report contained a material misrepresentation and seeks injunctive relief requiring MSI and MSPC to, among other things, establish internal recordkeeping and compliance monitoring systems. We believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend the lawsuit vigorously. We do not believe the resolution of the lawsuit will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

General 

In addition to the litigation discussed above, we are now, and may be in the future, involved in various other lawsuits, claims and proceedings incident to the ordinary course of business. The results of litigation are inherently unpredictable. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time and result in diversion of significant resources. 

For some of the matters disclosed above, as well as other lawsuits involving the Company, we are able to estimate a range of losses in excess of the amounts recorded, if any, in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As of October 29, 2016, the aggregate estimated loss is approximately $13 million, which includes amounts recorded by the Company.

11.   ACQUISITION 

On February 2, 2016, we acquired Lamrite for $150.0 million, prior to certain purchase price adjustments, utilizing our cash on hand. Lamrite operates an international wholesale business under the Darice brand name and 35 arts and crafts retail stores (32 as of the acquisition date), located primarily in Ohio and the surrounding states, under the Pat Catan s brand name. We incurred integration related costs of $1.6 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and $7.6 million during the nine months ended October 29, 2016. These expenses have been included in SG A in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 

The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805,   Business Combinations  . The acquisition resulted in goodwill primarily related to the expected benefits resulting from enhancements to our private brand development capability, direct sourcing initiatives and business-to-business capabilities, as well as the value of the existing Lamrite workforce. The goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.  

The fair values of the intangible assets acquired were primarily determined by using the income approach. The income approach indicates value for a subject based on the present value of cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.  Projected cash flows are discounted at a market rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money.  The fair value of inventory was determined based on the estimated selling price of the inventory less the expected costs of selling efforts and a reasonable profit margin. 

The following table summarizes the cash consideration for the acquisition of Lamrite (in thousands): 

The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquisition of Lamrite as of February 2, 2016 (in thousands):

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company (and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report), and the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company (and the related notes thereto) and the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016 ( Annual Report ) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) under the Securities Act of 1934 on March 17, 2016. 

All of the  Company ,  us ,  we ,  our , and similar expressions are references to The Michaels Companies, Inc. ( Michaels ) and our consolidated wholly-owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires. 

We report on the basis of a 52- or 53-week fiscal year, which ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. All references to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year began. References to  fiscal 2016  relate to the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2017 and references to  fiscal 2015  relate to the 52 weeks ended January 30, 2016. In addition, all references to  the third quarter of fiscal 2016  relate to the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and all references to  the third quarter of fiscal 2015  relate to the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2015. Finally, all references to  the first nine months of fiscal 2016  relate to the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and all references to  the first nine months of fiscal 2015  relate to the 39 weeks ended October 31, 2015. Because of the seasonal nature of our business, the results of operations for the 13 and 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016 are not indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year.  

Overview 

We are the largest arts and crafts specialty retailer in North America (based on store count) providing materials, project ideas and education for creative activities under the retail brands of Michaels, Aaron Brothers and Pat Catan s. We also operate an international wholesale business under the Darice brand name and a market-leading vertically-integrated custom framing business. At October 29, 2016, we operated 1,221 Michaels stores, 112 Aaron Brothers stores and 35 Pat Catan s stores. 

On February 2, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Lamrite West, Inc. and certain of its affiliates and subsidiaries ( Lamrite ) for $150.0 million, prior to certain purchase price adjustments, utilizing our cash on hand. Lamrite operates an international wholesale business under the Darice brand name ( Darice ) and 35 arts and crafts retail stores, located primarily in Ohio and the surrounding states, under the Pat Catan s brand name ( Pat Catan s ). We expect Lamrite to generate revenues of more than $200 million in fiscal 2016. The acquisition is expected to enhance our private brand development capabilities, accelerate our direct sourcing initiatives and strengthen our business-to-business capabilities. 

Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 increased 5.0% compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in net sales was due to a $65.2 million increase related to the acquisition of Lamrite in February 2016 and the opening of 19 additional stores (net of closures) since October 31, 2015, partially offset by a 2.0% decrease in comparable store sales. Gross profit as a percent of net sales decreased 180 basis points to 38.0% during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher promotional activity, an increase in distribution related costs and lower margins associated with Lamrite s wholesale business. The decline was partially offset by an increase in retail prices and sourcing efficiencies. Operating income as a percent of net sales decreased 1.4% to 11.9% for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 as compared to 13.3% in the same period in the prior year. The decrease is due primarily to the decline in gross profit margin, an increase in selling, general and administrative costs associated with the acquisition of Lamrite, inclusive of $1.6 million of integration costs, and an increase in professional fees.

Comparable Store Sales 

Comparable store sales represents the change in net sales for stores open the same number of months in the comparable period of the previous year, including stores that were relocated or expanded during either period, as well as e-commerce sales. A store is deemed to become comparable in its 14  th   month of operation in order to eliminate grand opening sales distortions. A store temporarily closed more than two weeks is not considered comparable during the month it is closed. If a store is closed longer than two weeks but less than two months, it becomes comparable in the month in which it reopens, subject to a mid-month convention. A store closed longer than two months becomes comparable in its 14  th   month of operation after its reopening.  Pat Catan s stores will not be included in comparable store sales until the 13  th   month after the acquisition.

Results of Operations 

The following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of line items of our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. This table should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and with our consolidated financial statements, including the related notes. 

13 Weeks Ended October 29, 2016 Compared to the 13 Weeks Ended October 31, 2015 

Net Sales.     Net sales increased $58.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, or 5.0%, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The increase in net sales was due to a $65.2 million increase related to the acquisition of Lamrite in fiscal 2016 and a $16.6 million increase related to 19 additional stores opened (net of closures) since October 31, 2015. The increase was partially offset by a $23.0 million decrease in comparable store sales. Comparable store sales decreased 2.0% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015 due to a decrease in customer transactions, partially offset by an increase in average ticket.  

Gross Profit.     Gross profit was 38.0% of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to 39.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.  The 180 basis point decline was primarily due to an increase in promotional activity, an increase in distribution related costs and lower margins associated with Lamrite s wholesale business, including $0.7 million of non-recurring purchase accounting adjustments related to inventory. The decline was partially offset by an increase in retail prices and sourcing efficiencies. 

Selling, General and Administrative  .   Selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) was 26.0% of net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to 26.4% for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. SG A increased $9.9 million to $318.6 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. The increase was due primarily to $15.8 million of expenses attributable to Lamrite s operations, $3.7 million associated with operating 19 additional stores (net of closures), a $2.2 million increase in professional fees and $1.6 million of Lamrite integration costs. The increase was partially offset by a $13.8 million decrease in performance based compensation and lower marketing costs. 

Interest Expense.   Interest expense decreased $2.3 million to $31.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to $1.9 million of interest savings from the partial redemption of our term loan credit facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and $0.4 million of interest savings due to the refinancing of our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility ( Restated Revolving Credit Facility ) in the second quarter of fiscal 2016.

Table of Contents  

Losses on Early Extinguishments of Debt and Refinancing Costs.   We recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $6.9 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 related to the amendment of our term loan credit facility.  

Provision for Income Taxes.   The effective tax rate was 29.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to 37.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The effective income tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 was lower than the same period in the prior year primarily due to benefits realized associated with our direct sourcing initiatives implemented in the current year, certain federal tax credits recognized and a decrease in state taxes. 

39 Weeks Ended October 29, 2016 Compared to the 39 Weeks Ended October 31, 2015 

Net Sales.     Net sales increased $216.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2016, or 6.7%, compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2015. The increase in net sales was due to a $172.7 million increase related to the acquisition of Lamrite in fiscal 2016 and a $50.3 million increase related to 19 additional stores opened (net of closures) since October 31, 2015. The increase was partially offset by a $6.9 million decrease in comparable store sales. Comparable store sales decreased 0.2% compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2015 due to a decrease in customer transactions, partially offset by an increase in average ticket.  

Gross Profit.     Gross profit was 38.4% of net sales in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 compared to 39.6% in the first nine months of fiscal 2015.  The 130 basis point decline was primarily due to an increase in promotional activity, an increase in distribution related costs and lower margins associated with Lamrite s wholesale business, including $2.9 million of non-recurring purchase accounting adjustments related to inventory. The decline was partially offset by an increase in retail prices and sourcing efficiencies.  

Selling, General and Administrative  .   SG A was flat at 27.2% of net sales in both the first nine months of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. SG A increased $59.1 million to $939.1 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2016. The increase was due primarily to $46.5 million of expenses attributable to Lamrite s operations, $11.6 million associated with operating 19 additional stores (net of closures), $7.6 million of Lamrite integration costs and a $6.3 million increase in professional fees. The increase was partially offset by a $17.3 million decrease in performance based compensation and lower marketing costs. 

Interest Expense.   Interest expense decreased $10.3 million to $95.7 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to $5.4 million of interest savings due to the partial redemption of our term loan credit facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, $3.6 million of interest savings from the redemption of our remaining outstanding 7.50%/8.25% PIK Toggle Notes due 2018 ( PIK Notes ) during the second quarter of fiscal 2015 and $0.7 million of interest savings from the refinancing of our Restated Revolving Credit Facility in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. 

Losses on Early Extinguishments of Debt and Refinancing Costs.   We recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $7.3 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2016, consisting of $6.9 million related to the amendment of our term loan credit facility and $0.4 million related to the refinancing of our Restated Revolving Credit Facility. We recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $6.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2015 related to the redemption of our remaining outstanding PIK Notes, consisting of $3.6 million of redemption premiums and $2.5 million to write off related debt issuance costs.   

Provision for Income Taxes.   The effective tax rate was 33.6% for the first nine months of fiscal 2016 compared to 36.9% for the first nine months of fiscal 2015. The effective tax rate is lower than the same period in the prior year primarily due to benefits realized associated with our direct sourcing initiatives implemented in the current year, certain federal tax credits recognized and a decrease in state taxes.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We require cash principally for day-to-day operations, to finance capital investments, to purchase inventory, to service our outstanding debt and for seasonal working capital needs. We expect that our available cash, cash flow generated from operating activities and funds available under our Amended Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) will be sufficient to fund planned capital expenditures, working capital requirements, debt repayments, debt service requirements and anticipated growth for the foreseeable future. Our ability to satisfy our liquidity needs and to continue to refinance or reduce debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described under Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016 or our failure to meet our debt covenants. Our Amended Revolving Credit Facility provides senior secured financing of up to $850.0 million, subject to a borrowing base. As of October 29, 2016, the borrowing base was $850.0 million, of which we had $57.3 million of outstanding standby letters of credit and $792.7 million of unused borrowing capacity. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $150.0 million at October 29, 2016, of which $37.5 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If it were necessary to repatriate these funds for use in the U.S., we would be required to pay U.S. taxes on the amount of undistributed earnings in our foreign subsidiaries. However, it is our intent to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside the U.S.   

On February 2, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Lamrite for $150.0 million, prior to certain purchase price adjustments, utilizing our cash on hand. Lamrite operates an international wholesale business under the Darice brand name and 35 arts and crafts retail stores, located primarily in Ohio and the surrounding states, under the Pat Catan s brand name. We expect Lamrite to generate revenues of more than $200 million in fiscal 2016. The acquisition is expected to enhance our private brand development capabilities, accelerate our direct sourcing initiatives and strengthen our business-to-business capabilities.  

In March 2016, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase $200.0 million of the Company s common stock on the open market. The share repurchase program does not have an expiration date, and the timing and number of repurchase transactions under the program will depend on market conditions, corporate considerations, debt agreements and regulatory requirements. Shares repurchased under the program are held as treasury shares until retired. As of October 29, 2016, we have repurchased 5.9 million shares for an aggregate amount of $156.5 million. In December 2016, the Board of Directors revised the existing share repurchase program and authorized the Company to purchase an additional $300.0 million of the Company s common stock, increasing the total amount of availability under the share repurchase program to $343.5 million.  

On May 27, 2016, Michaels Stores, Inc. ( MSI ) entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and other lenders to amend various terms of our Restated Revolving Credit Facility. The amended credit agreement, together with the related security, guarantee and other agreements, is referred to as the  Amended Revolving Credit Facility . The Amended Revolving Credit Facility provides for senior secured financing of up to $850.0 million, subject to a borrowing base. We have the right to request up to $200.0 million of additional commitments under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, although the lenders are not obligated to provide any such additional commitments. The borrowing base under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility equals the sum of: (i) 90% of eligible credit card receivables, (ii) 85% of eligible trade receivables, (iii) 90% to 92.5% of the appraised value of eligible inventory, plus (iv) 90% to 92.5% of the lesser of (a) the appraised value of eligible inventory supported by letters of credit and (b) the face amount of the letters of credit, less (v) certain reserves. The Amended Revolving Credit Facility matures in May 2021, subject to a springing maturity date if certain of our outstanding indebtedness has not been repaid, redeemed, refinanced, cash collateralized or if the necessary availability reserves have not been established prior to such time. Our obligations under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility are secured by (subject to certain exceptions) a first priority security interest in the current assets of the borrowers and facility guarantors and a second priority security interest in all other assets.  

On September 28, 2016, MSI entered into an amendment with Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch and other lenders to amend and restate our term loan credit facility. The amended and restated credit agreement, together with the related security, guarantee and other agreements, is referred to as the  Amended Term Loan Credit Facility . The Amended

Table of Contents  

Term Loan Credit Facility matures on January 28, 2023 and provides for senior secured financing of $2,269.7 million, the outstanding principal amount of the term loan credit facility at the time of the amendment. MSI has the right under the Amended Term Loan Credit Facility to request additional term loans (a) in the aggregate amount of up to $750.0 million or (b) at MSI s election, an amount of additional term loans if the consolidated secured debt ratio (as defined in the Amended Term Loan Credit Facility) is no more than 3.25 to 1.00 as of the last day of the most recently ended four quarter period, subject to certain adjustments. The lenders under the Amended Term Loan Credit Facility will not be under any obligation to provide any such additional term loans. Our obligations under the Amended Term Loan Credit Facility are secured by a second priority security interest in the current assets of the borrowers and facility guarantors and a first priority security interest in all other assets, subject to certain exceptions. 

We had total outstanding debt of $2,779.7 million at October 29, 2016, of which $2,269.7 million was subject to variable interest rates and $510.0 million was subject to fixed interest rates. 

Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk and prevent us from meeting our obligations. Management reacts strategically to changes in economic conditions and monitors compliance with debt covenants to seek to mitigate any potential material impacts to our financial condition and flexibility. 

We intend to use excess operating cash flows to invest in growth opportunities, repurchase outstanding shares and repay portions of our indebtedness, depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. As such, we and our subsidiaries, affiliates and significant shareholders may, from time to time, seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt (including publicly issued debt) through cash purchases and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. If we use our excess cash flows to repay our debt, it will reduce the amount of excess cash available for additional capital expenditures.   

Cash Flow from Operating Activities 

Cash flows provided by operating activities was $136.5 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 compared to $17.9 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2015. The improvement was primarily due to the timing of vendor payments and lower interest payments as a result of debt redemptions, partially offset by an increase in estimated federal tax payments and integration costs incurred as a result of the acquisition of Lamrite on February 2, 2016. 

Inventory at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2016 increased $117.0 million, or 9.2%, to $1,394.1 million, compared to $1,277.1 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2015.  The increase in inventory was primarily due to $95.4 million in additional inventory from the acquisition of Lamrite. Average inventory per Michaels store (inclusive of distribution centers, in-transit and inventory for the Company s e-commerce site) was $1.0 million, flat compared to average inventory per store at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2015.

The Company defines  Adjusted EBITDA  as EBITDA (excluding losses on early extinguishments of debt and refinancing costs) adjusted for certain defined amounts in accordance with the Company s Amended Term Loan Credit Facility and Amended Revolving Credit Facility (collectively, the  Adjustments ). 

The Company has presented EBITDA (excluding losses on early extinguishments of debt and refinancing costs) and Adjusted EBITDA to provide investors with additional information to evaluate our operating performance and our ability to service our debt. Adjusted EBITDA is a required calculation under the Company s Amended Term Loan Credit Facility and its Amended Revolving Credit Facility (together the  Senior Secured Credit Facilities ). As it relates to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, Adjusted EBITDA is used in the calculations of fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios, which, under certain circumstances determine mandatory repayments or maintenance covenants and may restrict the Company s ability to make certain payments (characterized as restricted payments), investments (including acquisitions) and debt repayments. 

As EBITDA (excluding losses on early extinguishments of debt and refinancing costs) and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of operating performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), these measures should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income, as an indicator of operating performance, or net cash provided by operating activities as an indicator of liquidity. Our computation of EBITDA (excluding losses on early extinguishments of debt and refinancing costs) and Adjusted EBITDA may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Information 

The above discussion, as well as other portions of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Any statements contained herein (including, but not limited to, statements to the effect that Michaels or its management  anticipates ,  plans ,  estimates ,  expects ,  believes ,  intends  and other similar expressions) that are not statements of historical fact should be considered forward-looking statements and should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report. Such forward-looking statements are based upon management s current knowledge and assumptions about future events and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from anticipated results, prospects, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Most of these factors are outside of our control and are difficult to predict. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to the following: 

risks related to the effect of economic uncertainty;     

our substantial outstanding indebtedness of $2.8 billion could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our $2.3 billion variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our notes and credit facilities;     

restrictions in our debt agreements that limit our flexibility in operating our business, as our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing our notes contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions and require that we maintain specified financial ratios upon the occurrence of certain events;     

changes in customer demand could materially adversely affect our sales, results of operations and cash flow;     

our failure to adequately maintain security and prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information, which could result in an additional data breach, could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results;     

competition, including internet-based competition, could negatively impact our business;     

our reliance on foreign suppliers increases our risk of not obtaining adequate, timely and cost-effective product supplies;     

how well we manage our business;     

our ability to open new stores and increase comparable store sales growth, as our growth depends on our strategy of expanding our base of retail stores; and, if we are unable to continue this strategy, our ability to increase our sales, profitability and cash flow could be impaired;     

damage to the reputation of the Michaels brand or our private and exclusive brands could adversely affect our sales;     

a weak fourth quarter would materially adversely affect our results of operations;     

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced may fail us and transitioning to other qualified vendors could materially adversely affect our revenue and profit growth;     

26 

Table of Contents  

unexpected or unfavorable consumer responses to our promotional or merchandising programs could materially adversely affect our sales, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition;     

our marketing programs, e-commerce initiatives and use of consumer information are governed by an evolving set of laws and enforcement trends and unfavorable changes in those laws or trends, or our failure to comply with existing or future laws, could substantially harm our business and results of operations;     

product recalls and/or product liability, as well as changes in product safety and other consumer protection laws, may adversely impact our operations, merchandise offerings, reputation, results of operation, cash flow, and financial condition;     

changes in regulations or enforcement, or our failure to comply with existing or future regulations, may adversely impact our business;     

significant increases in inflation or commodity prices such as petroleum, natural gas, electricity, steel, wood, and paper may adversely affect our costs, including cost of merchandise;     

we may be subject to information technology system failures or network disruptions, or our information systems may prove inadequate, resulting in damage to our reputation, business operations and financial condition;      

improvements to our supply chain may not be fully successful;     

changes in newspaper subscription rates may result in reduced exposure to our circular advertisements;     

disruptions in the capital markets could increase our costs of doing business;     

our real estate leases generally obligate us for long periods, which subjects us to various financial risks;     

we have co-sourced certain of our information technology, accounts payable, payroll, accounting and human resources functions, and may co-source other administrative functions, which makes us more dependent upon third parties;     

we are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. and Canadian dollar, which is the functional currency of our Canadian subsidiaries;     

we are dependent upon the services of our senior management team;      

failure to attract and retain quality sales, distribution center and other team members in appropriate numbers as well as experienced buying and management personnel could adversely affect our performance;     

our results may be adversely affected by serious disruptions or catastrophic events, including geo-political events and weather;     

any difficulty executing or integrating an acquisition, a business combination or a major business initiative could adversely affect our business or results of operations;     

our holding company structure makes us, and certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries, dependent on the operations of our, and their, subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations; and     

27 

Table of Contents  

investment funds affiliated with the Sponsors own approximately 50% of the outstanding shares of our common stock and as a result will have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted for stockholder approval, including the ability to direct the election of all of the members of our Board of Directors, and they may have interests that differ from those of other stockholders.     

For more details on factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements, please see the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report. Except as required by applicable law, we disclaim any intention to, and undertake no obligation to, update or revise any forward-looking statement. 

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

Foreign Currency Risk 

We are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. and Canadian dollar, which is the functional currency of our Canadian subsidiaries. Our sales, costs and expenses of our Canadian subsidiaries, when translated into U.S. dollars, can fluctuate due to exchange rate movement. A 10% increase or decrease in the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar would have increased or decreased net income by approximately $6 million for the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016. 

Interest Rate Risk 

We have market risk exposure arising from changes in interest rates on our Amended Term Loan Credit Facility and our Amended Revolving Credit Facility. The interest rates on our Amended Term Loan Credit Facility and our Amended Revolving Credit Facility will reprice periodically, which will impact our earnings and cash flow. The interest rate on our 2020 Senior Subordinated Notes is fixed. Based on our overall interest rate exposure to variable rate debt outstanding as of October 29, 2016, a 1% change in interest rates would impact income before income taxes by approximately $23 million for fiscal 2016. A 1% change in interest rates would impact the fair value of our long-term fixed rate debt by approximately $13 million. A change in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of our variable rate debt as the debt reprices periodically. 

Inflation Risk 

We do not believe inflation and changing commodity prices have had a material impact on our net sales, income from continuing operations, plans for expansion or other capital expenditures for any period presented in this report. However, we cannot be sure inflation and changing commodity prices will not have an adverse impact on our operating results, financial condition, plans for expansion or other capital expenditures in future periods. 

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. We note the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information   

28 

Table of Contents  

required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms.   

Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended October 29, 2016 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Part II OTHER INFORMATION   

ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS     

Information regarding legal proceedings is incorporated by reference from Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   

There have been no material changes to the Risk Factors described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

ITEM 2.   UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS   

The following table provides certain information with respect to our purchases of shares of the Company s common stock during the third quarter of fiscal 2016:  

(a) 

These amounts reflect the following transactions during the third quarter of fiscal 2016: (i) the repurchase of 1,196,697 shares as part of our publicly announced share repurchase program and (ii) the surrender of shares of common stock to the Company to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of employee restricted stock awards.     

(b) 

In March 2016, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to $200.0 million of the Company s common stock on the open market. The share repurchase program does not have an expiration date. The Company intends to retire shares repurchased under the program.

Date of Grant:  

[ ]  

The Michaels Companies, Inc. 2014 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan 

Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (Directors) 

This agreement (this    Agreement   ) evidences the grant of restricted stock units (the    Restricted Stock Units   ) by The Michaels Companies, Inc. (the    Company   ) to the individual named above (the    Grantee   ), pursuant to and subject to the terms of The Michaels Companies, Inc. 2014 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan (as amended from time to time, the    Plan   ), which is incorporated herein by reference. 

1. 
			 Grant of Restricted Stock Units  .  The Company hereby grants to the Grantee on the date of grant set forth above (the    Date of Grant   ) an award (the    Award   ) consisting of the right to receive, on the terms provided herein and in the Plan, one share of Stock with respect to each Restricted Stock Unit forming part of the Award, in each case, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Plan in respect of transactions occurring after the date hereof.     

2. 
			 Meaning of Certain Terms  .  Each initially capitalized term used but not separately defined herein has the meaning assigned to such term in the Plan.     

3. 
			 Vesting  .  The term  vest  as used herein with respect to any Restricted Stock Unit means the lapsing of the restrictions described herein with respect to such Restricted Stock Unit.  Unless earlier terminated, forfeited, relinquished or expired, the Award shall vest in full upon the first anniversary of the Date of Grant, provided that the Grantee has remained in continuous Employment from the Date of Grant through the applicable vesting date.     

4. 
			 Forfeiture Risk  .  If the Grantee s Employment ceases for any reason, including death, any then outstanding and unvested Restricted Stock Units acquired by the Grantee hereunder shall be automatically and immediately forfeited, subject to Section 3(b) above.     

5. 
			 Delivery of Stock  .  The Company shall deliver to the Grantee as soon as practicable upon the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units (or any portion thereof), but in all events no later than thirty (30) days following the date on which such Restricted Stock Units vest, one share of Stock with respect to each such vested Restricted Stock Unit, subject to the terms of the Plan and this Agreement.     

6. 
			 Dividends,   etc  .  The Grantee shall have the rights of a shareholder with respect to a share of Stock subject to the Award only at such time, if any, as such share is actually delivered under the Award.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, the Grantee shall not be entitled to vote any share of Stock subject to the Award or to receive or be credited with any dividend or other distribution declared and payable on any such share unless such share has been actually delivered hereunder and is      

1 

held by the Grantee on the record date for such vote or dividend (or other distribution), as the case may be.     

7. 
			 Nontransferability  .  Neither the Award nor the Restricted Stock Units may be transferred.     

8. 
			 Certain Tax Matters  .         

(a) 

The Grantee expressly acknowledges and agrees that the Grantee s rights hereunder, including the right to be issued shares of Stock upon the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units (or any portion thereof), are subject to the Grantee s promptly paying, or in respect of any later requirement of withholding being liable promptly to pay at such time as such withholdings are due, to the Company in cash (or by such other means as may be acceptable to the Administrator in its discretion) all taxes required to be withheld, if any (the  Withholding Obligation ).       

(b) 

By accepting the Award, the Grantee hereby acknowledges and agrees that, unless the Grantee notifies the Company at least two (2) days prior to the vesting that he or she, the Grantee will have been deemed to have elected to have the Company hold back whole shares of Stock otherwise deliverable pursuant to Section 5 having a fair market value sufficient to satisfy the Withholding Obligation (but not in excess of the applicable minimum statutory withholding obligations or such greater amount that would not result in adverse accounting consequences to the Company), with the Company accepting a payment in cash or by check by the Grantee to the extent of any remaining balance of the Withholding Obligation not satisfied by such withholding of shares.     

(c) 

The Grantee expressly acknowledges that because the Award consists of an unfunded and unsecured promise by the Company to deliver Stock in the future, subject to the terms hereof, it is not possible to make a so-called  83(b) election  with respect to the Award.     

9. 
			 Forfeiture/Recovery of Compensation  .  By accepting the Award the Grantee expressly acknowledges and agrees that his or her rights, and those of any permitted transferee, under the Award or to any Stock received following the vesting of the Award or proceeds from the disposition thereof, are subject to Section 6(a)(5) of the Plan (including any successor provision).  Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be construed as limiting the general application of Section 12 of this Agreement.     

10. 
			 Form S-8 Prospectus  .  The Grantee acknowledges having received and reviewed a copy of the prospectus required by Part I of Form S-8 relating to shares of Stock that may be issued under the Plan.       

11. 
			 Governing Law  .                                                Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, Section 10 of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State      

2 

of Texas, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction, except where preempted by federal law.  Both parties hereby consent and submit to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in Dallas County, Texas in all questions and controversies arising out of this Agreement.     

12. 
			 Acknowledgments  .  By accepting the Award, the Grantee agrees to be bound by, and agrees that the Award is, and the Restricted Stock Units are, subject in all respects to, the terms of the Plan.  The Grantee further acknowledges and agrees that (a) the signature to this Agreement on behalf of the Company is an electronic signature that will be treated as an original signature for all purposes hereunder, and (b) such electronic signature will be binding against the Company and will create a legally binding agreement when this Agreement is countersigned by the Grantee.
