NOTE 1.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
    
  We, Summit Financial Group, Inc. and subsidiaries, prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and with instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for annual year end financial statements.  In our opinion, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included and are of a normal recurring nature. 
    
  The presentation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. 
    
  The results of operations for the quarter and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.  The consolidated financial statements and notes included herein should be read in conjunction with our   2015   audited financial statements and Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Certain accounts in the consolidated financial statements for   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  , as previously presented, have been reclassified to conform to current year classifications. 

NOTE 2.  SIGNIFICANT NEW AUTHORITATIVE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE 
    
  ASU 2015-01,   Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20) - Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items   eliminates from U.S. GAAP the concept of extraordinary items, which, among other things, required an entity to segregate extraordinary items considered to be unusual and infrequent from the results of ordinary operations and show the item separately in the income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations.  ASU 2015-01 was effective for us January 1, 2016, and did not have a significant impact on our financial statements. 
    
  ASU 2015-03,   Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) - Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   specifies that debt issuance costs related to a recognized liability are to be reported in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.  The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. ASU 2015-03 was effective for us January 1, 2016 and did not have a material impact on our financial statements. 
    
  The guidance of ASU No. 2015-03 did not address presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. Given the absence of authoritative guidance for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements within the update, in ASU 2015-15,     Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) - Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements (Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting),   issued in August 2015, the SEC staff stated that they would not object to any entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement.  
    
  ASU 2015-16,   Business Combinations (Topic 805)   Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments   requires that adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period of a business combination be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Furthermore, the income statement effects of such adjustments, if any, must be calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date reflecting the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. Under previous guidance, adjustments to provisional amounts identified during the measurement period are to be recognized retrospectively. ASU 2015-16 became effective for us on January 1, 2016 and did not have a significant impact on our financial statements.  
    
  ASU 2016-01,   Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  , among other things, (i) requires equity investments, with certain exceptions, to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income, (ii) simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment, (iii) eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to  
  
    Table of Contents  
  10 

be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet, (iv) requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes, (v) requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments, (vi) requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements and (viii) clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale. ASU 2016-01 will be effective for us on January 1, 2018 and is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements. 
    
  ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   will, among other things, require lessees to recognize a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. ASU 2016-02 does not significantly change lease accounting requirements applicable to lessors; however, certain changes were made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and ASC Topic 606,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . ASU 2016-02 will be effective for us on January 1, 2019 and will require transition using a modified retrospective approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-02 on our financial statements.  
    
  ASU 2016-05,   Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships,   clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument under ASC Topic 815 does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. ASU 2016-05 will be effective for us on January 1, 2017 and is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements.  
    
  ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,   requires that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share-based payment awards be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement during the period in which they occur. Previously, such amounts were recorded in the pool of excess tax benefits included in additional paid-in capital, if such pool was available. Because excess tax benefits are no longer recognized in additional paid-in capital, the assumed proceeds from applying the treasury stock method when computing earnings per share should exclude the amount of excess tax benefits that would have previously been recognized in additional paid-in capital. Additionally, excess tax benefits should be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity rather than a financing activity, as was previously the case. ASU 2016-09 also provides that an entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest (current GAAP) or account for forfeitures when they occur. ASU 2016-09 changes the threshold to qualify for equity classification (rather than as a liability) to permit withholding up to the maximum statutory tax rates (rather than the minimum as was previously the case) in the applicable jurisdictions. ASU 2016-09 will be effective on January 1, 2017 and is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements.  
    
  ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,   requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts and requires enhanced disclosures related to the significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an organization s portfolio. In addition, ASU 2016-13 amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. ASU 2016-13 will be effective on January 1, 2020. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-13 on our financial statements. 
    
  ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   provides guidance related to certain cash flow issues in order to reduce the current and potential future diversity in practice. ASU 2016-15 will be effective for us on January 1, 2018 and is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements.  
    
  ASU 2016 16,   Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory   requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory at the time that the transfer occurs. Current guidance does not require recognition of tax consequences until the asset is eventually sold to a third party. ASU 2016-16 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within, beginning after December 15, 2017,  with early adoption permitted as of the first interim period presented in a year. We are evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016 16 on January 1, 2018 to our consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 3.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
    
  ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  ASC Topic 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. 
    
  Level 1  : Quoted prices (unadjusted) or identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. 
    
  Level 2  : Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, and other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
    
  Level 3  : Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. 
           
  Accordingly, securities available-for-sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, we may be required to record other assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, such as loans held for sale, and impaired loans held for investment.  These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of lower of cost or market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. 
    
  Following is a description of valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. 
    
  Available-for-Sale Securities  :  Investment securities available-for-sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices, if available.  If quoted prices are not available, fair values are measured using independent pricing models or other model-based valuation techniques such as the present value of future cash flows, adjusted for the security s credit rating, prepayment assumptions and other factors such as credit loss assumptions.  Level 1 securities include those traded on an active exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange, U.S. Treasury securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in active over-the-counter markets and money market funds.  Level 2 securities include mortgage-backed securities issued by government sponsored entities, municipal bonds and corporate debt securities. 
    
  Derivative Financial Instruments  :  Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement is based on pricing models run by a third-party, utilizing observable market-based inputs.  All future floating cash flows are projected and both floating and fixed cash flows are discounted to the valuation date.  As a result, we classify interest rate swaps as Level 2. 
    
  Loans Held for Sale  :    Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or market value.  The fair value of loans held for sale is based on what secondary markets are currently offering for portfolios with similar characteristics.  As such, we classify loans subject to nonrecurring fair value adjustments as Level 2. 
    
  Loans  :    We do not record loans at fair value on a recurring basis. However, from time to time, a loan is considered impaired and an allowance for loan loss is established.  Loans for which it is probable that payment of interest and principal will not be made in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan agreement are considered impaired.  Once a loan is identified as individually impaired, management measures impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 310,   Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan  .  The fair value of impaired loans is estimated using one of several methods, including collateral value, liquidation value and discounted cash flows. Those impaired loans not requiring an allowance represent loans for which the discounted cash flows or  collateral value exceeds the recorded investments in such loans. These loans are carried at recorded loan investment, and therefore are not included in the following tables of loans measured at fair value. Impaired loans internally graded as substandard, doubtful, or loss are evaluated using the fair value of collateral method.  All other impaired loans are measured for impairment using the discounted cash flows method.  In accordance with ASC Topic 310, impaired loans where an allowance is established based on the fair value of collateral requires classification in the fair value hierarchy. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value, we record the impaired loan as nonrecurring Level 2. When a current appraised value is not available and there is no observable market price, we record the impaired loan as nonrecurring Level 3.   

12 

When impaired loans are deemed required to be included in the fair value hierarchy, management immediately begins the process of evaluating the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral to determine if a related specific allowance for loan losses or charge-off is necessary.  Current appraisals are ordered once a loan is deemed impaired if the existing appraisal is more than   twelve   months old, or more frequently if there is known deterioration in value. For recently identified impaired loans, a current appraisal may not be available at the financial statement date. Until the current appraisal is obtained, the original appraised value is discounted, as appropriate, to compensate for the estimated depreciation in the value of the loan s underlying collateral since the date of the original appraisal.  Such discounts are generally estimated based upon management s knowledge of sales of similar collateral within the applicable market area and its knowledge of other real estate market-related data as well as general economic trends.  When a new appraisal is received (which generally are received within   3   months of a loan being identified as impaired), management then re-evaluates the fair value of the collateral and adjusts any specific allocated allowance for loan losses, as appropriate.  In addition, management also assigns a discount of 7 10% for the estimated costs to sell the collateral. 
    
  Foreclosed properties:    Foreclosed properties consists of real estate acquired in foreclosure or other settlement of loans. Such assets are carried on the balance sheet at the lower of the investment in the real estate or its fair value less estimated selling costs.  The fair value of foreclosed properties is determined on a nonrecurring basis generally utilizing current appraisals performed by an independent, licensed appraiser applying an income or market value approach using observable market data (Level 2).  Updated appraisals of foreclosed properties are generally obtained if the existing appraisal is more than   18   months old or more frequently if there is a known deterioration in value.  However, if a current appraisal is not available, the original appraised value is discounted, as appropriate, to compensate for the estimated depreciation in the value of the real estate since the date of its original appraisal.  Such discounts are generally estimated based upon management s knowledge of sales of similar property within the applicable market area and its knowledge of other real estate market-related data as well as general economic trends (Level 3).  Upon foreclosure, any fair value adjustment is charged against the allowance for loan losses.  Subsequent fair value adjustments are recorded in the period incurred and included in other noninterest expense in the consolidated statements of income. 
    
  Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
    
  The table below presents the recorded amount of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
    
  We may be required, from time to time, to measure certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  These include assets that are measured at the lower of cost or market that were recognized at fair value below cost at the end of the period.  Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are included in the table below.

ASC Topic 825,   Financial Instruments  , requires disclosure of the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including those financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis or non-recurring basis.  The following summarizes the methods and significant assumptions we used in estimating our fair value disclosures for financial instruments. 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents:    The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents approximate their estimated fair value. 
    
  Interest bearing deposits with other banks:    The carrying values of interest bearing deposits with other banks approximate their estimated fair values. 
    
  Federal funds sold:    The carrying values of Federal funds sold approximate their estimated fair values. 
    
  Securities:    Estimated fair values of securities are based on quoted market prices, where available.  If quoted market prices are not available, estimated fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable securities. 
    
  Loans held for sale:    The carrying values of loans held for sale approximate their estimated fair values. 
    
  Loans:    The estimated fair values for loans are computed based on scheduled future cash flows of principal and interest, discounted at interest rates currently offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality.  No prepayments of principal are assumed. 
    
  Accrued interest receivable and payable:    The carrying values of accrued interest receivable and payable approximate their estimated fair values. 
    
  Deposits:    The estimated fair values of demand deposits (i.e. non-interest bearing checking, NOW, money market and savings accounts) and other variable rate deposits approximate their carrying values.  Fair values of fixed maturity deposits are estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology at rates currently offered for deposits with similar remaining maturities.  Any intangible value of long-term relationships with depositors is not considered in estimating the fair values disclosed. 
    
  Short-term borrowings:    The carrying values of short-term borrowings approximate their estimated fair values. 
    
  Long-term borrowings:    The fair values of long-term borrowings are estimated by discounting scheduled future payments of principal and interest at current rates available on borrowings with similar terms. 
    
  Subordinated debentures owed to unconsolidated subsidiary trusts:    The carrying values of subordinated debentures owed to unconsolidated subsidiary trusts approximate their estimated fair values. 
    
  Derivative financial instruments:    The fair value of the interest rate swaps is valued using independent pricing models. 
    
  Off-balance sheet instruments:    The fair values of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present credit standing of the counter parties.  The amounts of fees currently charged on commitments and standby letters of credit are deemed insignificant, and therefore, the estimated fair values and carrying values are not shown below.

Management performs pre-purchase and ongoing analysis to confirm that all investment securities meet applicable credit quality standards.  Prior to July 1, 2013, we principally used credit ratings from Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations ( NRSROs ) to support analyses of our portfolio of securities issued by state and political subdivisions, as we generally do not purchase securities that are rated below the six highest NRSRO rating categories.  Beginning July 1, 2013, in addition to considering a security s NRSRO rating, we now also assess or confirm through an internal review of an issuer s financial information and other applicable information that:  1) the issuer s risk of default is low; 2) the characteristics of the issuer s demographics and economic environment are satisfactory; and 3) the issuer s budgetary position and stability of tax or other revenue sources are sound. 
    
  The maturities, amortized cost and estimated fair values of securities at   September 30, 2016  , are summarized as follows: 

The proceeds from sales, calls and maturities of available for sale securities, including principal payments received on mortgage-backed obligations, and the related gross gains and losses realized, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are as follows: 

We held   48   available for sale securities having an unrealized loss at   September 30, 2016  .  We do not intend to sell these securities, and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost bases.  We believe that this decline in value is primarily attributable to the lack of market liquidity and to changes in market interest rates and not due to credit quality.  Accordingly, no other-than-temporary impairment charge to earnings is warranted at this time.

NOTE 6.  LOANS 
    
  Loans are generally stated at the amount of unpaid principal, reduced by unearned discount and allowance for loan losses. Interest on loans is accrued daily on the outstanding balances.  Loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and amortized as adjustments of the related loan yield over its contractual life. We categorize residential real estate loans in excess of $  600,000   as jumbo loans. 
    
  Generally, loans are placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest is greater than   90   days past due based upon the loan's contractual terms.  Interest is accrued daily on impaired loans unless the loan is placed on nonaccrual status.  Impaired loans are placed on nonaccrual status when the payments of principal and interest are in default for a period of   90   days, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection.  Interest on nonaccrual loans is recognized primarily using the cost-recovery method.  Loans may be returned to accrual status when repayment is reasonably assured and there has been demonstrated performance under the terms of the loan or, if applicable, the terms of the restructured loans. 
    
  Commercial-related loans or portions thereof (which are risk-rated) are charged off to the allowance for loan losses when the loss has been confirmed.  This determination is made on a case by case basis considering many factors, including the prioritization of our claim in bankruptcy, expectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and valuation of the borrower s equity.  We deem a loss confirmed when a loan or a portion of a loan is classified  loss  in accordance with bank regulatory classification guidelines, which state,  Assets classified loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted . 
    
  Consumer-related loans are generally charged off to the allowance for loan losses upon reaching specified stages of delinquency, in accordance with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council policy.  For example, credit card loans are charged off by the end of the month in which the account becomes   180   days past due or within   60   days from receiving notification about a specified event (e.g., bankruptcy of the borrower), which ever is earlier.  Residential mortgage loans are generally charged off to net realizable value no later than when the account becomes   180   days past due.  Other consumer loans, if collateralized, are generally charged off to net realizable value at   120   days past due. 
    
  Loans are summarized as follows:

Nonaccrual loans:    The following table presents the nonaccrual loans included in the net balance of loans at   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  . 

Impaired loans:    Impaired loans include the following: 

Loans which we risk-rate (consisting of loan relationships having aggregate balances in excess of $  2.5 million  , or loans exceeding $  500,000   and exhibiting credit weakness) through our normal loan review procedures and which, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan agreement.   Risk-rated loans with insignificant delays or insignificant short falls in the amount of payments expected to be collected are not considered to be impaired. 

Loans that have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring. 
       
  Both commercial and consumer loans are deemed impaired upon being contractually modified in a troubled debt restructuring. Troubled debt restructurings typically result from our loss mitigation activities and occur when we grant a concession to a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty in order to minimize our economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral.  Once restructured in a troubled debt restructuring, a loan is generally considered impaired until its maturity, regardless of whether the borrower performs under the modified terms.  Although such a loan may be returned to accrual status if the criteria set forth in our accounting policy are met, the loan would continue to be evaluated for an asset-specific allowance for loan losses and we would continue to report the loan in the impaired loan table below. 
    
  The table below sets forth information about our impaired loans.

A modification of a loan is considered a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR ) when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the modification constitutes a concession that we would not otherwise consider. This may include a transfer of real estate or other assets from the borrower, a modification of loan terms, or a combination of both.  A loan continues to be classified as a TDR for the life of the loan.  Included in impaired loans are TDRs of   $29.2 million  , of which   $28.5 million   were current with respect to restructured contractual payments at   September 30, 2016  , and   $30.5 million  , of which   $28.9 million   were current with respect to restructured contractual payments at   December 31, 2015  .  There were no commitments to lend additional funds under these restructurings at either balance sheet date. 
    
  The following table presents by class the TDRs that were restructured during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   . Generally, the modifications were extensions of term, modifying the payment terms from principal and interest to interest only for an extended period, or reduction in interest rate.  All TDRs are evaluated individually for allowance for loan loss purposes.

We categorize loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. We analyze loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk.  We internally grade all commercial loans at the time of loan origination. In addition, we perform an annual loan review on all non-homogenous commercial loan relationships with an aggregate exposure of $  2.5 million  , at which time these loans are re-graded. 
    
  We use the following definitions for our risk grades: 
    
  Pass:   Loans graded as Pass are loans to borrowers of acceptable credit quality and risk. They are higher quality loans that do not fit any of the other categories described below. 
    
  OLEM (Special Mention):    Commercial loans categorized as OLEM are potentially weak. The credit risk may be relatively minor yet represent a risk given certain specific circumstances. If the potential weaknesses are not monitored or mitigated, the asset may weaken or inadequately protect our position in the future. 
    
  Substandard:     Commercial loans categorized as Substandard are inadequately protected by the borrower s ability to repay, equity, and/or the collateral pledged to secure the loan. These loans have identified weaknesses that could hinder normal repayment or collection of the debt. These loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the identified weaknesses are not mitigated. 
    
  Doubtful:    Commercial loans categorized as Doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those loans classified as Substandard, with the added elements that the full collection of the loan is improbable and the possibility of loss is high. 
    
  Loss:    Loans classified as loss are considered to be non-collectible and of such little value that their continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted. This does not mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery value, but rather it is neither practical nor desirable to defer writing off the loan, even though partial recovery may be obtained in the future. 
    
  The following table presents the recorded investment in construction and development, commercial, and commercial real estate loans which are generally evaluated based upon the internal risk ratings defined above.

The following table presents the recorded investment in consumer, residential real estate, and home equity loans, which are generally evaluated based on the aging status of the loans, which was previously presented, and payment activity. 

Loan commitments:    ASC Topic 815,   Derivatives and Hedging,   requires that commitments to make mortgage loans should be accounted for as derivatives if the loans are to be held for sale, because the commitment represents a written option and accordingly is recorded at the fair value of the option liability. 

NOTE 7.  ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES 
    
  We maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio.  The allowance is comprised of   three   distinct reserve components:  (1) specific reserves related to loans individually evaluated, (2) quantitative reserves related to loans collectively evaluated, and (3) qualitative reserves related to loans collectively evaluated.  A summary of the methodology we employ on a quarterly basis with respect to each of these components in order to evaluate the overall adequacy of our allowance for loan losses is as follows: 
    
  Specific Reserve for Loans Individually Evaluated 
    
  First, we identify loan relationships having aggregate balances in excess of   $500,000   and that may also have credit weaknesses.  Such loan relationships are identified primarily through our analysis of internal loan evaluations, past due loan reports, and loans adversely classified by regulatory authorities.  Each loan so identified is then individually evaluated to determine whether it is impaired   that is, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the underlying loan agreement.  Substantially all of our impaired loans historically have been collateral dependent, meaning repayment of the loan is expected or is considered to be provided solely from the sale of the loan s underlying collateral.  For such loans, we measure impairment based on the fair value of the loan s collateral, which is generally determined utilizing current appraisals.  A specific reserve is established in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the recorded investment in each impaired loan over the fair value of its underlying collateral, less estimated costs to sell. Our policy is to re-evaluate the fair value of collateral dependent loans at least every   twelve   months unless there is a known deterioration in the collateral s value, in which case a new appraisal is obtained.  Beginning in 2014, for purposes of loans that have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring and  not internally graded as substandard, doubtful, or loss ("performing TDRs") we began measuring impairment using the discounted cash flows method.    Under this method, a specific reserve is established in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the recorded investment in each impaired loan over its discounted cash flows. 
    
  Quantitative Reserve for Loans Collectively Evaluated 
    
  Second, we stratify the loan portfolio into the following   eleven   loan pools:  land and land development, construction, commercial, commercial real estate -- owner-occupied, commercial real estate -- non-owner occupied, conventional residential mortgage, jumbo residential mortgage, home equity, mortgage warehouse lines, consumer, and other.  Quantitative reserves  
  
    Table of Contents  
  31 

relative to each loan pool are established as follows:  for all loan segments detailed above an allocation equaling   100%   of the respective pool s average   12   month historical net loan charge-off rate (determined based upon the most recent twelve quarters) is applied to the aggregate recorded investment in the pool of loans. 
    
  Qualitative Reserve for Loans Collectively Evaluated 
    
  Third, we consider the necessity to adjust our average historical net loan charge-off rates relative to each of the above   eleven   loan pools for potential risks factors that could result in actual losses deviating from prior loss experience.  For example, if we observe a significant increase in delinquencies within the conventional mortgage loan pool above historical trends, an additional allocation to the average historical loan charge-off rate is applied.  Such qualitative risk factors considered are:  (1) levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans, (2) levels of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries, (3)trends in volume and term of loans, (4) effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards, and other changes in lending policies, procedures, and practice, (5) experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff, (6) national and local economic trends and conditions, (7) industry conditions, and (8) effects of changes in credit concentrations. 
    
  An analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and for the year ended   December 31, 2015   is as follows:

We recorded amortization expense of approximately   $150,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   relative to our other intangible assets.  Annual amortization is expected to approximate   $200,000   for each of the years ending 2016 through 2020.

NOTE 10.  BORROWED FUNDS 
    
  Short-term borrowings:      A summary of short-term borrowings is presented below: 

Table of Contents

Long-term borrowings:    Our long-term borrowings of   $74.1 million  ,   $75.6 million   and   $76.1 million   at   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015  , and   September 30, 2015   respectively, consisted primarily of advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) and structured reverse repurchase agreements with   two   unaffiliated institutions. All FHLB advances are collateralized primarily by similar amounts of residential mortgage loans, certain commercial loans, mortgage backed securities and securities of U. S. Government agencies and corporations. 

The term loan at   September 30, 2016   is secured by the common stock of our subsidiary bank and bears a variable interest rate of prime minus 50 basis points with a final maturity of 2017. Our long term FHLB borrowings and reverse repurchase agreements bear both fixed and variable rates and mature in varying amounts through the year 2026. 
    
  The average interest rate paid on long-term borrowings for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   was   4.43%   compared to   4.37%   for the first   nine   months of   2015  . 
    
  Subordinated debentures owed to unconsolidated subsidiary trusts:    We have   three   statutory business trusts that were formed for the purpose of issuing mandatorily redeemable securities (the  capital securities ) for which we are obligated to third party investors and investing the proceeds from the sale of the capital securities in our junior subordinated debentures (the  debentures ).  The debentures held by the trusts are their sole assets.  Our subordinated debentures totaled $  19.6 million   at   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015  , and   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  In October 2002, we sponsored SFG Capital Trust I, in March 2004, we sponsored SFG Capital Trust II, and in December 2005, we sponsored SFG Capital Trust III, of which   100%   of the common equity of each trust is owned by us.  SFG Capital Trust I issued $  3.5 million   in capital securities and $  109,000   in common securities and invested the proceeds in $  3.61 million   of debentures. SFG Capital Trust II issued $  7.5 million   in capital securities and $  232,000   in common securities and invested the proceeds in $  7.73 million   of debentures. SFG Capital Trust III issued $  8.0 million   in capital securities and $  248,000   in common securities and invested the proceeds in $  8.25 million   of debentures.  Distributions on the capital securities issued by the trusts are payable quarterly at a variable interest rate equal to 3 month LIBOR plus 345basis points for SFG Capital Trust I, 3 month LIBOR plus 280basis points for SFG Capital Trust II, and 3 month LIBOR plus 145basis points for SFG Capital Trust III, and equals the interest rate earned on the debentures held by the trusts, and is recorded as interest expense by us.  The capital securities are subject to mandatory redemption in whole or in part, upon repayment of the debentures.  We have entered into agreements which, taken collectively, fully and unconditionally guarantee the capital securities subject to the terms of the guarantee.  The debentures of each Capital Trust are redeemable by us quarterly. 
    
  The capital securities held by SFG Capital Trust I, SFG Capital Trust II, and SFG Capital Trust III qualify as Tier 1 capital under Federal Reserve Board guidelines.  In accordance with these Guidelines, trust preferred securities generally are limited to   25%   of Tier 1 capital elements, net of goodwill.  The amount of trust preferred securities and certain other elements in excess of the limit can be included in Tier 2 capital. 
    
  A summary of the maturities of all long-term borrowings and subordinated debentures for the next five years and thereafter is as follows:

NOTE 11.  SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION 
    
  The 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan ( 2014 LTIP ) was adopted by our shareholders in May 2014 to enhance the ability of the Company to attract and retain exceptionally qualified individuals to serve as key employees. The LTIP provides for the issuance of up to   500,000   shares of common stock, in the form of equity awards including stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights ("SARs"), performance units, other stock-based awards or any combination thereof,  to our key employees.  
    
  Stock options awarded under the 2009 Officer Stock Option Plan and the 1998 Officer Stock Option Plan (collectively, the  Plans ) were not altered by the 2014 LTIP, and remain subject to the terms of the Plans.  However, under the terms of the 2014 LTIP, all shares of common stock remaining issuable under the Plans at the time the 2014 LTIP was adopted ceased to be available for future issuance. 
    
  Under the 2014 LTIP and the Plans, stock options and SARs have generally been granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of Summit's common stock on the grant date. We periodically grant employee stock options to individual employees.  During second quarter 2015, we granted   166,717   SARs that become exercisable ratably over   five   years (  20%   per year) and expire   ten   years after the grant date.  There were   no   grants of stock options or SARs during the first nine months of 2016. 
    
  The fair value of our employee stock options and SARs granted under the Plans is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, changes to which can materially affect the fair value estimate. Additionally, there may be other factors that would otherwise have a significant effect on the value of employee stock options and SARs granted but are not considered by the model. Because our employee stock options and SARs have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management s opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options and SARs at the time of grant. The assumptions used to value SARs issued during 2015 were a risk-free interest rate of   1.96%  , an expected dividend yield of   2.75%  , an expected common stock volatility of   61.84%  , and an expected life of   10   years. 
    
  We recognize compensation expense based on the estimated number of stock awards expected to actually vest, exclusive of the awards expected to be forfeited.  During the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , our stock compensation expense and related deferred taxes were insignificant. 
    
  A summary of activity in our Plans during the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015   is as follows:

NOTE 12.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  We are a party to certain financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers.  These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the statement of financial position.  The contract amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement that we have in this class of financial instruments. 
    
  Many of our lending relationships contain both funded and unfunded elements.  The funded portion is reflected on our balance sheet.  The unfunded portion of these commitments is not recorded on our balance sheet until a draw is made under the loan facility.  Since many of the commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash flow requirements. 
    
  A summary of the total unfunded, or off-balance sheet, credit extension commitments follows: 

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.  Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.  We evaluate each customer's credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis.  The amount of collateral obtained, if we deem necessary upon extension of credit, is based on our credit evaluation.  Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, equipment or real estate. 
    
  Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.  Standby letters of credit generally are contingent upon the failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of the underlying contract with the third party. 
    
  Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments.  We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. 
    
  Legal Contingencies 
    
  On May 13, 2014, the ResCap Liquidating Trust ( ResCap ), as successor to Residential Funding Company, LLC f/k/a Residential Funding Corporation ( RFC ), filed a complaint against Summit Financial Mortgage, LLC ( Summit Mortgage ), a former  
  
    Table of Contents  
  37 

residential mortgage subsidiary of Summit whose operations were discontinued in 2007, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York and subsequently amended its complaint on July 25, 2014. The Amended Complaint asserts the following   three   causes of action related to Summit Mortgage s origination and subsequent sale of mortgage loans to Residential Funding Corporation:  1) Summit Mortgage breached its representations and warranties made in the contract governing the sale of the mortgage loans to RFC;  2) an indemnification claim against Summit Mortgage for damages paid by ResCap to settle claims in RFC s bankruptcy proceeding which allegedly relate to mortgage loans Summit Mortgage sold to RFC; 3) a claim for damages against Summit Community Bank, Inc., former parent of Summit Mortgage, arising out of a guaranty in which the Bank guaranteed Summit Mortgage s full performance under the contract governing the sale of mortgage loans to RFC.  Summit has filed a motion to dismiss the case.  Based upon the applicable statute of limitations, the Court granted our motion to dismiss the breach of contract claim with respect to loans Summit sold to RFC prior to March 14, 2006.  The court otherwise denied our motion to dismiss on the grounds that the other arguments raised factual questions that could not be decided on a motion to dismiss.  An estimate as to possible loss resulting from the Amended Complaint cannot be provided at this time because such an estimate cannot be made. Summit intends to defend these claims vigorously.    
    
  We are not a party to any other litigation except for matters that arise in the normal course of business.  While it is impossible to ascertain the ultimate resolution or range of financial liability with respect to these contingent matters, in the opinion of management, the outcome of these matters will not have a significant adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements. 

NOTE 13.  REGULATORY MATTERS 
    
  We and our subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the banking regulatory agencies.  Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, we and each of our subsidiaries must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our and our subsidiaries  assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.  We and each of our subsidiaries  capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. 
    
  Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require us and each of our subsidiaries to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier I capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier I capital (as defined) to average assets (as defined).  We believe, as of   September 30, 2016  , that we and each of our subsidiaries met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject. 
    
  The most recent notifications from the banking regulatory agencies categorized us and each of our subsidiaries as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.  To be categorized as well capitalized, we and each of our subsidiaries must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier I risk-based, and Tier I leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. 
  The Basel III Capital Rules became effective for us on January 1, 2015, with full compliance with all of the final rule's requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule, to be fully phased-in by January 1, 2019. As of   September 30, 2016  , our capital levels remained characterized as "well-capitalized" under the new rules. See the Capital Requirements section included in Part I Item 1 Business of our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of Basel III.

The following table presents Summit's, as well as our subsidiary, Summit Community Bank's ("Summit Community"), actual and required minimum capital amounts and ratios as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   under the Basel III Capital Rules.  The minimum required capital levels presented below reflect the minimum required capital levels (inclusive of the full capital conservation buffers) that will be effective as of January 1, 2019 when the Basel III Capital Rules have been fully phased-in.  Capital levels required to be considered well capitalized are based upon prompt corrective action regulations, as amended to reflect the changes under the Basel III Capital Rules. 

NOTE  14.  SEGMENT INFORMATION 
    
  We operate   two   business segments:  community banking and insurance   financial services.  These segments are primarily identified by the products or services offered.  The community banking segment consists of our full service banks which offer customers traditional banking products and services through various delivery channels.  The insurance   financial services segment includes   three   insurance agency offices that sell insurance products.  The accounting policies discussed throughout the notes to the consolidated financial statements apply to each of our business segments. 

Table of Contents

NOTE  15.  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
    
  We use derivative instruments primarily to protect against the risk of adverse interest rate movements on the cash flows of certain liabilities and the fair values of certain assets.  Derivative instruments represent contracts between parties that usually require little or no initial net investment and result in one party delivering cash or another type of asset to the other party based upon a notional amount and an underlying as specified in the contract.  A notional amount represents the number of units of a specific item, such as currency units.  An underlying represents a variable, such as an interest rate or price index.  The amount of cash or other asset delivered from one party to the other is determined based upon the interaction of the notional amount of the contract with the underlying.  Derivatives can also be implicit in certain contracts and commitments. 
    
  As with any financial instrument, derivative instruments have inherent risks, primarily market and credit risk.  Market risk associated with changes in interest rates is managed by establishing and monitoring limits as to the degree of risk that may be undertaken as part of our overall market risk monitoring process.  Credit risk occurs when a counterparty to a derivative contract with an unrealized gain fails to perform according to the terms of the agreement.  Credit risk is managed by monitoring the size and maturity structure of the derivative portfolio, and applying uniform credit standards to all activities with credit risk. 
  
    Table of Contents  
  41 

In accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.  Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, depending on the type of hedge transaction. 
    
  Fair-value hedges     For transactions in which we are hedging changes in fair value of an asset, liability, or a firm commitment, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are generally offset in the income statement by changes in the hedged item s fair value. 
    
  Cash-flow hedges     For transactions in which we are hedging the variability of cash flows related to a variable-rate asset, liability, or a forecasted transaction, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are reported in other comprehensive income. The gains and losses on the derivative instrument, which are reported in comprehensive income, are reclassified to    earnings in the periods in which earnings are impacted by the variability of cash flows of the hedged item. 
    
  The ineffective portion of all hedges is recognized in current period earnings. 
    
  Other derivative instruments     For risk management purposes that do not meet the hedge accounting criteria and, therefore, do not qualify for hedge accounting.  These derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the income statement. 
    
  We have entered into   three   forward-starting, pay-fixed/receive LIBOR interest rate swaps.  $  40 million   notional with an effective date of July 18, 2016, was designated as a cash flow hedge of $  40 million   of forecasted variable rate Federal Home Loan Bank advances.  Under the terms of this swap we will pay a fixed rate of   2.98%   for a   3   year period.  $  30 million   notional with an effective date of April 18, 2016, was designated as a cash flow hedge of $  30 million   of forecasted variable rate Federal Home Loan Bank advances.  Under the terms of this swap we will pay a fixed rate of   2.89%   for a   4.5   year period.   $  40 million   notional with an effective date of October 18, 2016,  was designated as a cash flow hedge of $  40 million   of forecasted variable rate Federal Home Loan Bank advances.  Under the terms of the swap we will pay a fixed rate of   2.84%   for a   3   year period. 
    
  We have entered into   two   pay fixed/receive variable interest rate swaps to hedge fair value variability of two commercial fixed rate loans with the same principal, amortization, and maturity terms of the underlying loans, which are designated as fair value hedges. Under the terms of a   $9.95 million   original notional swap with an effective date of January 15, 2015, we will pay a fixed rate of   4.33%   for a   10   year period. Under the terms of a   $11.3 million   original notional swap with an effective date of December 18, 2015, we will pay a fixed rate of   4.30%    for a   10   year period.

NOTE 16.  EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN ("ESOP") 
    
  On July 30, 2015, our ESOP purchased   225,000   shares of Summit Financial Group Inc. common stock in a privately negotiated transaction, at   $10.80   per share for a total purchase price of   $2,430,000  .  On July 21, 2015, our Board of Directors approved the company lending to our ESOP   $2,250,000   to partially finance the purchase, and was used to purchase   208,333   unallocated shares. 
    
  In accordance with ASC 718,   Compensation - Stock Compensation  , this purchase of unallocated ESOP shares will be shown as a reduction of shareholders' equity, similar to a purchase of treasury stock.  The loan receivable from the ESOP to the Company is not reported as an asset nor is the debt of the ESOP reported as a liability on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Cash dividends on allocated shares (those credited to ESOP participants' accounts) are recorded as a reduction of shareholders' equity and distributed directly to participants' accounts.  Cash dividends on unallocated shares (those held by the ESOP not yet credited to participants' accounts) are used to pay a portion of the ESOPs debt service requirements.   
    
  Unallocated ESOP shares will be allocated to ESOP participants ratably as the ESOP's loan is repaid.  When the shares are committed to be released and become available for allocation to plan participants, the then fair value of such shares will be charged to compensation expense.  Unallocated shares owned by the Company s ESOP are not considered to be outstanding for the purpose of computing earnings per share. 
    
  The ESOP shares as of September 30 as are follows: 

NOTE 17.  ACQUISITIONS 
  On October 1, 2016, Summit Community Bank, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Summit, acquired Highland County Bankshares, Inc. ("HCB") and its subsidiary First and Citizens Bank, headquartered in Monterey, Virginia, for   $21.8 million  .  HCB's assets and liabilities approximated   $123 million   and   $107 million  , respectively, at September 30, 2016. 
  The former First and Citizens offices will continue to operate under that name until close of business on Friday, December 2, 2016, and will commence operating under the name Summit Community Bank on Monday, December 5, 2016.  
  On June 1, 2016, we entered into a Definitive Merger Agreement between Summit Community Bank, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Summit, and First Century Bankshares, Inc. ("FCB"). Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Summit Community Bank, Inc. will acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of FCB in exchange for cash in the amount of   $22.50   per share or   1.2433   shares of Summit common stock.  FCB shareholders will have a right to receive cash, Summit's common stock, or a combination of cash and Summit stock, subject to proration to result in approximately   35%   cash and   65%   stock consideration in the aggregate, subject to an adjustment if FCB s adjusted shareholders  equity as of the effective date of  
  
    Table of Contents  
  43 

the merger deviates materially from the target determined by the parties.  FCB's assets approximated   $413 million   at September     30, 2016. 
  We have received all regulatory approvals, and anticipate the acquisition will close early 2017, subject to customary closing conditions, including  approval of FCB's shareholders.  Following the consummation of the merger, FCB s wholly-owned subsidiary First Century Bank will be consolidated with Summit Community Bank.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

INTRODUCTION 
    
  The following discussion and analysis focuses on significant changes in our financial condition and results of operations of Summit Financial Group, Inc. ( Company  or  Summit ) and our operating segments, Summit Community Bank ( Summit Community ), and Summit Insurance Services, LLC for the periods indicated.  See Note 14 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for our segment information.  This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our 2015 audited financial statements and Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  The Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995 indicates that the disclosure of forward-looking information is desirable for investors and encourages such disclosure by providing a safe harbor for forward-looking statements by us.  Our following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainty.  In order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor, we note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in those forward-looking statements. 

OVERVIEW 
    
  Our primary source of income is net interest income from loans and deposits.  Business volumes tend to be influenced by the overall economic factors including market interest rates, business spending, and consumer confidence, as well as competitive conditions within the marketplace. 
    
  Interest earning assets increased by 6.46% for the first   nine   months in   2016   compared to the same period of   2015   while our net interest earnings on a tax equivalent basis increased 3.69%.  Our tax equivalent net interest margin decreased 10 basis points as our yield on interest earning assets declined 4 basis points while our cost of interest bearing funds increased 7 basis points. 

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS 
    
  We are organized and managed along two major business segments, as described in Note 14 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  The results of each business segment are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a stand alone business.  Net income by segment follows: 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and follow general practices within the financial services industry.  Application of these principles requires us to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes.  These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions, and judgments.  Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. 
    
  Our most significant accounting policies are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  These policies, along with the other disclosures presented in the financial statement notes and in this financial review, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. 
    
  Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying those amounts, we have identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of goodwill, fair value measurements and deferred tax assets to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments, and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. 
    
  Allowance for Loan Losses:    The allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio.  Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it  
  
    Table of Contents  
  45 

requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change.  The loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on our consolidated balance sheet.  To the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates, additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would negatively impact earnings in future periods.  Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements of our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in the Asset Quality section of the financial review of the 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  Goodwill:    Goodwill is subject to an analysis by reporting unit at least annually to determine whether write-downs of the recorded balances are necessary.  Initially, an assessment of qualitative factors (Step 0) is performed to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.  If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.  However, if we conclude otherwise, then we are required to perform the first step (Step 1) of the two-step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit.  If the fair value is less than the carrying value, an expense may be required on our books to write down the goodwill to the proper carrying value.  Step 2 of impairment testing, which is necessary only if the reporting unit does not pass Step 1, compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill for the reporting unit.  The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as goodwill that is recognized in a business combination. 
    
  Community Banking     During third quarter 2016, we performed the Step 0 assessment of our goodwill of our community banking reporting unit and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value was less than its carrying value.  In performing the qualitative Step 0 assessments, we considered certain events and circumstances  such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance and cost factors when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. No indicators of impairment were noted as of September 30, 2016. 
    
  Insurance Services     During third quarter 2016, we performed the Step 0 assessment of our goodwill of our insurance services reporting unit.  We considered certain events and circumstances specific to the reporting unit, such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance and cost factors when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our insurance services reporting unit is less than its carrying value and deemed it necessary to perform the further 2-step impairment test.  We performed an internal valuation utilizing the income approach to determine the fair value of our insurance services reporting unit.  This methodology consisted of discounting the expected future cash flows of this unit based upon a forecast of its operations considering long-term key business drivers such as anticipated commission revenue growth.  The long term growth rate used in determining the terminal value was estimated at 2.5%, and a discount rate of 10.0% was applied to the insurance services unit s estimated future cash flows.  We did not fail this Step 1 test as of September 30, 2016, therefore Step 2 testing was not necessary. 
    
  We cannot assure you that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings. See Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our intangible assets, which include goodwill. 
    
  Fair Value Measurements:    ASC Topic 820   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   provides a definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Based on the observability of the inputs used in the valuation techniques, we classify our financial assets and liabilities measured and disclosed at fair value in accordance with the three-level hierarchy (e.g., Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3) established under ASC Topic 820. Fair value determination in accordance with this guidance requires that we make a number of significant judgments. In determining the fair value of financial instruments, we use market prices of the same or similar instruments whenever such prices are available. We do not use prices involving distressed sellers in determining fair value. If  
  observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain, then fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analyses. These modeling techniques incorporate our assessments regarding assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability, including assumptions about the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique and the risk of nonperformance. 

Table of Contents  
  46 

Fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting. Additionally, fair value is used on a non-recurring basis to evaluate assets or liabilities for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with ASC Topic 825   Financial Instruments  . 
    
  Deferred Income Tax Assets:    At   September 30, 2016  , we had net deferred tax assets of $11.9 million. Based on our ability to offset the net deferred tax asset against taxable income in carryback years and expected future taxable income in carryforward years, there was no impairment of the deferred tax asset at   September 30, 2016  .  All available evidence, both positive and negative, was considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, impairment should be recognized. However, our forecast process includes judgmental and quantitative elements that may be subject to significant change. If our forecast of taxable income within the carryback/carryforward periods available under applicable law is not sufficient to cover the amount of net deferred tax assets, such assets may become impaired. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Earnings Summary 
    
  Net income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased to   $12.6 million  , or   $1.18   per diluted share as compared to   $12.0 million   or   $1.12   per diluted share for the same period of   2015  .  Net income for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   increased to   $4.3 million  , or   $0.40   per diluted share, compared to   $3.7 million  , or   $0.34   per diluted share for the same period of 2015.  Earnings for the both the quarter and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods of 2015, were positively impacted by increased net interest income, increased gains on sales of foreclosed properties, and reduced write-downs of foreclosed properties while being negatively impacted by smaller gains realized on sales of securities, higher personnel costs and other noninterest expenses.  Included in earnings for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $836,000   in realized securities gains,   $451,000   in gains on the sales of foreclosed properties, and   $503,000   of charges resulting from the write-down of a portion of our foreclosed properties to fair value.  Returns on average equity and assets for the first   nine   months of   2016   were 11.29% and 1.09%, respectively, compared with 11.61% and 1.09% for the same period of   2015  . 

Net Interest Income 
    
  Net interest income is the principal component of our earnings and represents the difference between interest and fee income generated from earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds.  Fluctuations in interest rates as well as changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can materially impact net interest income. 
    
  Our net interest income on a fully tax-equivalent basis totaled   $36.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , or $1,311,000 or 3.70% more than the   $35.4 million   for the same period of   2015  .  Our tax-equivalent earnings on interest earning assets increased $2,466,000, while the cost of interest bearing liabilities also increased $1,155,000 (see Table II). 
    
  Average interest earning assets increased 6.5% from $1.35 billion during the first nine months of 2015 to $1.44 billion for the first nine months of 2016, while average interest bearing liabilities increased 5.1% from $1.19 billion at   September 30, 2015   to $1.26 billion at   September 30, 2016  .  The growth in interest earning assets outpaced the growth in interest bearing liabilities, and was funded primarily by reductions in property held for sale, growth in deposits, increased short term borrowings, and growth in equity. 
    
  Our consolidated net interest margin decreased to 3.40% for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to 3.50% for the same period in 2015, as the yields on earning assets decreased 4 basis points, while the cost of our interest bearing funds increased by 7 basis points. 
    
  Assuming no significant change in market interest rates and excluding the impact of pending acquisitions, we anticipate modest growth in our net interest income to continue over the near term due to growth in the volume of interest earning assets, primarily loans, coupled with expected moderate improvement in net interest margin over the same period.  We continue to monitor the net interest margin through net interest income simulation to minimize the potential for any significant negative impact.  See the  Market Risk Management  section for further discussion of the impact changes in market interest rates could have on us.  Further analysis of our yields on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are presented in Tables I and II below.

Noninterest Income 
    
  Total noninterest income decreased to   $8.6 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016  , compared to   $9.0 million   for the same period of   2015  .  Further detail regarding noninterest income is reflected in the following table.

  Total noninterest expense increased   1.1%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , with increased gains on sales of foreclosed properties and lower write-downs of  foreclosed properties having the largest positive impacts and higher salaries, commissions, and employee benefits having the largest negative impact.  Table IV below shows the breakdown of the changes. 
  
    Table of Contents  
  49 

Salaries, commissions, and employee benefits:    These expenses are   8.8%   higher in first nine months of 2016 compared to first nine months of 2015 due to an increase in number of employees, general merit raises, and increased incentive accruals based upon performance.  In accordance with our policies, substantially all salary and wage merit raises are awarded at the beginning of the second quarter of each year. 
    
  Foreclosed properties expense:    Management expects foreclosed properties expense to trend lower than in recent years due to lower levels of foreclosed properties. 
    
  Write-downs of foreclosed properties:    Management anticipates write-downs of foreclosed properties to their fair values to trend lower in 2016 than in recent years. 

Credit Experience 
    
  As a result of a historically slow economic recovery, our foreclosed properties portfolio remains elevated relative to our peers.   Prior elevated levels of nonperforming loans have returned to acceptable levels.  Management expects net reductions in foreclosed properties to continue, although not as rapid as over the past two years. 
    
  For purposes of this discussion, we define nonperforming assets to include foreclosed properties, other repossessed assets, and nonperforming loans, which is comprised of loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest and nonaccrual loans.  Performing TDRs are excluded from nonperforming loans. 
    
  The provision for loan losses represents charges to earnings necessary to maintain an adequate allowance for probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Our determination of the appropriate level of the allowance is based on an ongoing analysis of credit quality and loss potential in the loan portfolio, change in the composition and risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, and the anticipated influence of national and local economic conditions.  The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is reviewed quarterly and adjustments are made as considered necessary. 
    
  We recorded   $500,000   and   $1,000,000   provisions for loan losses for the first   nine   months of    2016   and   2015  , respectively.  These smaller provisions are a result of lower average loan losses experienced over the past twelve quarters.  Lower losses cause our historical charge-off factor of the quantitative reserve calculation to decline, thus requiring fewer quantitative reserves.

As illustrated in Table V below, our non-performing assets have decreased since year end   2015  . 

The following table details the activity regarding our foreclosed properties for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

Refer to Note 6 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding our past due loans, impaired loans, nonaccrual loans, and troubled debt restructurings and to Note 7 for a summary of the methodology we employ on a quarterly basis to evaluate the overall adequacy of our allowance for loan losses. 
    
  Relationship between Allowance for Loan Losses, Net Charge-offs and Nonperforming Loans 
    
  In analyzing the relationship between the allowance for loan losses, net loan charge-offs and nonperforming loans, it is helpful to understand the process of how loans are treated as they deteriorate over time. Reserves for loans are established at origination through the quantitative and qualitative reserve process discussed in the accompanying Note 7 to the financial statements. 
    
  Charge-offs, if necessary, are typically recognized in a period after the reserves were established. If the previously established reserves exceed that needed to satisfactorily resolve the problem credit, a reduction in the overall level of the reserve could be  
  
    Table of Contents  
  51 

recognized. In summary, if loan quality deteriorates, the typical credit sequence is periods of reserve building, followed by periods of higher net charge-offs. 
    
  Consumer loans are generally charged off to the allowance for loan losses upon reaching specified stages of delinquency, in accordance with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council policy.  For example, credit card loans are charged off by the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due or within 60 days from receiving notification about a specified event (e.g., bankruptcy of the borrower), whichever is earlier.  Residential mortgage loans are generally charged off to net realizable value no later than when the account becomes 180 days past due.  Other consumer loans, if collateralized, are generally charged off to net realizable value at 120 days past due. 
    
  Commercial-related loans (which are risk-rated) are charged off to the allowance for loan losses when the loss has been confirmed. This determination includes many factors, including the prioritization of our claim in bankruptcy, expectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and valuation of the borrower s equity. 
    
  Substantially all of our nonperforming loans are secured by real estate. The majority of these loans were underwritten in accordance with our loan-to-value policy guidelines which range from 70-85% at the time of origination. The fair values of the underlying collateral value or the discounted cash flows remain in excess of the recorded investment in many of our nonperforming loans, and therefore, no specific reserve allocation is required. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015  , and   September 30, 2015  , our allowance for loan losses totaled   $11.6 million  , or   0.93%   of total loans,   $11.5 million  , or   1.05%   of total loans and   $11.2 million  , or   1.05%   of total loans, respectively, and is considered adequate to cover our estimate of probable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015  , and   September 30, 2015  , we had approximately   $24.8 million  ,   $25.6 million   and   $29.7 million  , respectively, in other real estate owned which was obtained as the result of foreclosure proceedings.  Although foreclosed property is recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell, the prices ultimately realized upon their sale may or may not result in us recognizing loss. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION 
    
  Our total assets were   $1.66 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $1.49 billion   at   December 31, 2015  , representing an 11.1% increase.  Table VIII below serves to illustrate significant changes in our financial position between   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  . 

Net loans grew   14.4%   during the first   nine   months of   2016   principally as a result of us entering into a participation arrangement with a regional bank to fund residential mortgage warehouse lines of medium- and large-sized mortgage originators located throughout the United States. The outstanding balance of these lines totaled $109.0 million at September 30, 2016. Our loan growth was funded primarily with deposits, short-term borrowings and a reduction of our securities portfolio. 
    
  Deposits increased approximately   $90.1 million   during the first   nine   months of   2016  ; checking deposits remained relatively unchanged, while savings deposits and time deposits increased approximately $54.7 million and $35.2 million, respectively. 
    
  Refer to Notes 5, 6, 9, and 10 of the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information with regard to changes in the composition of our securities, loans, deposits and borrowings between   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  Liquidity reflects our ability to ensure the availability of adequate funds to meet loan commitments and deposit withdrawals, as well as provide for other transactional requirements.  Liquidity is provided primarily by funds invested in cash and due from banks (net of float and reserves), Federal funds sold, non-pledged securities, and available lines of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh ( FHLB ) and Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, which totaled approximately $530 million or 31.95% of total consolidated assets at   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Our liquidity strategy is to fund loan growth with deposits and other borrowed funds while maintaining an adequate level of short- and medium-term investments to meet normal daily loan and deposit activity.  As a member of the FHLB, we have access to approximately $547 million.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , these advances totaled approximately $232 million and $169 million, respectively.  At   September 30, 2016  , we had additional borrowing capacity of $315 million through FHLB programs.  We have established a line with the Federal Reserve Bank to be used as a contingency liquidity vehicle.  The amount available on this line at   September 30, 2016   was approximately $93 million, which is secured by a pledge of our consumer and commercial and industrial loan portfolios.  We have a $6 million unsecured line of credit with a correspondent bank.  Also, we classify all of our securities as available for sale to enable us to liquidate them if the need arises. 
    
  Liquidity risk represents the risk of loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future commitments based on external market issues, customer or creditor perception of financial strength, and events unrelated to Summit such as war, terrorism, or financial institution market specific issues.  The Asset/Liability Management Committee ( ALCO ), comprised of members of senior management and certain members of the Board of Directors, oversees our liquidity risk management process.   The ALCO develops and recommends policies and limits governing our liquidity to the Board of  
  Directors for approval with the objective of ensuring that we can obtain cost-effective funding to meet current and future obligations, as well as maintain sufficient levels of on-hand liquidity, under both normal and  stressed  circumstances. 
    
  We continuously monitor our liquidity position to ensure that day-to-day as well as anticipated funding needs are met.  We are not aware of any trends, commitments, events or uncertainties that have resulted in or are reasonably likely to result in a material change to our liquidity. 
    
  One of our continuous goals is maintenance of a strong capital position.  Through management of our capital resources, we seek to provide an attractive financial return to our shareholders while retaining sufficient capital to support future growth.  Shareholders  equity at   September 30, 2016   totaled   $153.8 million   compared to   $143.7 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Refer to Note 13 of the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding regulatory restrictions on our capital as well as our subsidiaries  capital. 

CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS 
    
  During our normal course of business, we incur contractual cash obligations.  The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at   September 30, 2016  .

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
    
  We are involved with some off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have an effect on our financial condition, liquidity, or capital.  These arrangements at   September 30, 2016   are presented in the following table.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT 
    
  Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates, exchange rates and equity prices.  Interest rate risk is our primary market risk and results from timing differences in the repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, changes in relationships between rate indices and the potential exercise of imbedded options.  The principal objective of asset/liability management is to minimize interest rate risk and our actions in this regard are taken under the guidance of our Asset/Liability Management Committee ( ALCO ), which is comprised of members of senior management and members of the Board of Directors.  The ALCO actively formulates the economic assumptions that we use in our financial planning and budgeting process and establishes policies which control and monitor our sources, uses and prices of funds. 
    
  Some amount of interest rate risk is inherent and appropriate to the banking business.  Our net income is affected by changes in the absolute level of interest rates.  Our interest rate risk position at present is slightly liability sensitive.  The nature of our lending and funding activities tends to drive our interest rate risk position to being liability sensitive.  That is, absent any changes in the volumes of our interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities, liabilities are likely to reprice faster than assets, resulting in a decrease in net income in a rising rate environment.  Net income would increase in a falling interest rate environment.  Net income is also subject to changes in the shape of the yield curve.  In general, a flattening yield curve would result in a decline in our earnings due to the compression of earning asset yields and funding rates, while a steepening would result in increased earnings as margins widen. 
    
  Several techniques are available to monitor and control the level of interest rate risk.  We primarily use earnings simulations modeling to monitor interest rate risk.  The earnings simulation model forecasts the effects on net interest income under a variety of interest rate scenarios that incorporate changes in the absolute level of interest rates and changes in the shape of the yield curve.  Each increase or decrease in interest rates is assumed to gradually take place over the next 12 months, and then remain stable, except for the up 400 scenario, which assumes a gradual increase in rates over 24 months.  Assumptions used to project yields and rates for new loans and deposits are derived from historical analysis.  Securities portfolio maturities and prepayments are reinvested in like instruments.  Mortgage loan prepayment assumptions are developed from industry estimates of prepayment speeds.  Noncontractual deposit repricings are modeled on historical patterns. 
    
  The following table presents the estimated sensitivity of our net interest income to changes in interest rates, as measured by our earnings simulation model as of   September 30, 2016  .  The sensitivity is measured as a percentage change in net interest income given the stated changes in interest rates (gradual change over 12 months, stable thereafter for the down 100 and the up 200 scenarios, and gradual change over 24 months for the up 400 scenario) compared to net interest income with rates unchanged in the same period.  The estimated changes set forth below are dependent on the assumptions discussed above and are well within our ALCO policy limits shown below relative to reductions in net interest income over the ensuing twelve month period.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted as of   September 30, 2016  , an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e).  Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016   were effective.  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
