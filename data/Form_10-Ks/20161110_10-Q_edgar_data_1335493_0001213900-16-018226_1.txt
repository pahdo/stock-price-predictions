Business Description and Presentation  

Provision Holding, Inc. ( Provision 
or the  Company ) focused on the development and distribution of Provision s patented three-dimensional, holographic
interactive displays focused at grabbing and holding consumer attention particularly and initially in the advertising and product
merchandising markets. The systems display a moving 3D image size to forty inches in front of the display, projecting a digital
video image out into space detached from any screen, rendering truly independent floating images featuring high definition and
crisp visibility from far distances. The nearest comparable to this technology can be seen in motion pictures such as Star Wars
and Minority Report, where objects and humans are represented through full-motion holograms. 

Provision s proprietary and patented display
technologies and software, and innovative solutions aim to attract consumer attention. Currently the Company has multiple contracts
to place Provision s products into large retail stores, as well as signed agreements with advertising agents to sell ad space
to Fortune 500 customers. Given the technology s potential in the advertising market, the Company is focused on creating
recurring revenue streams from the sale of advertising space on each unit. 

Corporate History  

On February 14, 2008, MailTec, Inc. (now known
as Provision Holding, Inc.) (the  Company ) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, which was amended and restated
on February 27, 2008 (as amended and restated, the  Agreement ), and closed effective February 28, 2008, with ProVision
Merger Corp., a Nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the  Subsidiary ) and Provision Interactive
Technologies, Inc., a California corporation ( Provision ). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Subsidiary merged into Provision,
and Provision became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. As consideration for the merger of the Subsidiary into Provision,
the Company issued 20,879,350 shares of the Company s common stock to the shareholders, creditors, and certain warrant holders
of Provision, representing approximately 86.5% of the Company s aggregate issued and outstanding common stock, and the outstanding
shares and debt, and those warrants whose holders received shares of the Company s common stock, of Provision were transferred
to the Company and cancelled. 

Going Concern and Management Plans  

These financial statements are presented on
the basis that the Company is a going concern. Going concern contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities
in the normal course of business over a reasonable length of time. The Company had accumulated deficit at September 30, 2016 of
$36,381,789. The Company has negative working capital of $8,963,910 as of September 30, 2016. These matters raise substantial doubt
about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do
not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company's continuation
as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis, to
obtain additional financing or refinancing as may be required and, ultimately, to attain profitable operations. Management s
plan to eliminate the going concern situation include, but are not limited to, the raise of additional capital through issuance
of debt and equity, improved cash flow management, aggressive cost reductions, and the creation of additional sales and profits
across its product lines. 

Basis of presentation  

Throughout this report, the terms
 we ,  us ,  ours ,  Provision  and  company  refer to Provision
Holding, Inc., including its wholly-owned subsidiary. The condensed consolidated balance sheet presented as of June 30, 2016
has been derived from the Company s audited consolidated financial statements. The unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, (instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X). Certain information and footnote disclosures
normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America, have been omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations, but we believe that the disclosures
are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and
notes included herein should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements and notes for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2016 included in Provision s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 13, 2016. In the opinion
of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal, recurring adjustments and disclosures necessary for a fair presentation
of these interim statements have been included. The results of operations for the three months  ended September 30, 2016 are
not necessarily indicative of the results for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017.

NOTE 1   
       
       ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION (Continued)    

Principles of Consolidation and Reporting  

The consolidated financial statements include
the financial statements of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary. All significant inter-company balances and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company uses a fiscal year end of June 30. 

There have been no significant changes in the
Company's significant accounting policies during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to what was previously disclosed
in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. 

Basis of comparison  

Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified
to conform to the current period presentation. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts and timing of revenues and expenses, the reported amounts and classification of assets
and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and assumptions are based on the Company s
historical results as well as management s future expectations. The Company s actual results could vary materially
from management s estimates and assumptions. 

Management makes estimates that affect certain
accounts including, deferred income tax assets, estimated useful lives of property and equipment, accrued expenses, fair value
of equity instruments and reserves for any other commitments or contingencies. Any adjustments applied to estimates are recognized
in the year in which such adjustments are determined. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

The Company considers all highly liquid investments,
with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased, to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30,
2016, the Company s cash and cash equivalents were on deposit in federally insured financial institutions, and at times may
exceed federally insured limits. 

Accounts Receivable  

Accounts receivable are not collateralized and
interest is not accrued on past due accounts. Periodically, management reviews the adequacy of its provision for doubtful accounts
based on historical bad debt expense results and current economic conditions using factors based on the aging of its accounts receivable.
After management has exhausted all collection efforts, management writes off receivables and the related reserve. Additionally,
the Company may identify additional allowance requirements based on indications that a specific customer may be experiencing financial
difficulties. Actual bad debt results could differ materially from these estimates. 

Inventories  

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
(first-in, first-out) or market. The Company periodically reviews its inventories for indications of slow movement and obsolescence
and records an allowance when it is deemed necessary.

NOTE 1   
       
       ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION (Continued)    

Property and Equipment  

Property and equipment are stated at cost. When
retired or otherwise disposed, the related carrying value and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts
and the net difference less any amount realized from disposition, is reflected in earnings. For financial statement purposes, property
and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Long-lived
tangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying value of
the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are recognized based on estimated fair values if the sum of expected future
undiscounted cash flows of the related assets is less than their carrying values. 

Intangibles  

Intangibles represent primarily costs incurred
in connection with patent applications. Such costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the useful life of the patent
once issued, or expensed immediately if any specific application is unsuccessful. 

Revenue Recognition  

The Company recognizes gross sales when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, title transfer has occurred, the price is fixed or readily determinable, and collection is probable. It
recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 605, Revenue Recognition ( ASC
605 ). Revenue from licensing, distribution and marketing agreements is recognized over the term of the contract. Revenue
from the sale of hardware is recognized when the product is complete and the buyer has accepted delivery. Provisions for discounts
and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related
sales are recorded. 

Cost of Revenue  

Cost of revenue in respect to sale of hardware
consists of costs associated with manufacturing of 3D displays, Kiosk machine, transportation, and other costs that are directly
related to a revenue-generating. Such expenses are classified as cost of revenue in the corresponding period in which the revenue
is recognized in the accompanying income statement. 

Depreciation and Amortization  

The Company depreciates its property and equipment
using the straight-line method with estimated useful lives from three to seven years. For federal income tax purposes, depreciation
is computed using an accelerated method. 

Shipping and Handling Costs  

The Company s policy is to classify shipping
and handling costs as a component of Costs of Revenues in the Statement of Operations. 

Unearned Revenue  

The Company bills customers in advance for certain
of its services. If the customer makes payment before the service is rendered to the customer, the Company records the payment
in a liability account entitled customer prepayments and recognizes the revenue related to the services when the customer receives
and utilizes that service, at which time the earnings process is complete. The Company recorded $3,369,774 and $3,419,616 as of
September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively as deferred revenue. 

Significant Customers  

During the three months ended
September 30, 2016 the Company had one customer which accounted for more than 10% of the Company s revenues (85%)During the
three months ended September 30, 2015 the Company had one customer which accounted for more than 10% of the Company s revenues
(96%).

NOTE 1   
       
       ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION (Continued)    

Research and Development Costs  

The Company charges all research and development
costs to expense when incurred. Manufacturing costs associated with the development of a new process or a new product are expensed
until such times as these processes or products are proven through final testing and initial acceptance by the customer. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, the Company incurred $150,132 and $32,069, respectively for research and development expense which are included in the
unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

Fair value estimates discussed herein are based
upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016. The
respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments, approximate their fair values. These financial instruments
include cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and notes payable. Fair values were assumed to approximate
carrying values for these financial instruments because they are short term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair
values or they are receivable or payable on demand. 

The Company uses fair value measurements under
the three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure for fair value measures.
The three levels are defined as follows: 

Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.   

Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.   

Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value.   

The following table provides a summary of the
changes in fair value of the Company s Promissory Notes, which are both Level 3 liabilities as of September 30, 2016: 

The Company determined the value of its convertible
notes using a market interest rate and the value of the warrants and beneficial conversion feature issued at the time of the transaction
less the accretion. There is no active market for the debt and the value was based on the delayed payment terms in addition to
other facts and circumstances at the end of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016.

NOTE 1   
       
       ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION (Continued)    

Derivative Financial Instruments  

The Company evaluates our financial instruments
to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial
instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then
re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. For stock-based derivative
financial instruments, the Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model to value the derivative instruments. The classification
of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the
end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based
on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. 

Certain of the Company s embedded conversion
features on debt and outstanding warrants are treated as derivative liabilities for accounting purposes under ASC 815 due to insufficient
authorized shares to settle these outstanding contracts, or due to other rights connected with these contracts, such as registration
rights. In the case of insufficient authorized share capital available to fully settle outstanding contracts, the Company utilizes
the latest maturity date sequencing method to reclassify outstanding contracts as derivative instruments. These contracts are recognized
currently in earnings until such time as the warrants are exercised, expire, the related rights have been waived and/or the authorized
share capital has been amended to accommodate settlement of these contracts. These instruments do not trade in an active securities
market. 

The classification of derivative instruments,
including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting
period. Derivative instruments that become subject to reclassification are reclassified at the fair value of the instrument on
the reclassification date. Derivative instrument liabilities will be classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current
based on whether or not settlement of the derivative instrument is expected within 12 months of the balance sheet date.  

The Company estimates the fair value of these
instruments using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the intrinsic value if the convertible notes are due on demand. 

We have determined that certain convertible
debt instruments outstanding as of the date of these financial statements include an exercise price  reset  adjustment
that qualifies as derivative financial instruments under the provisions of ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in an
Entity s Own Stock ( ASC 815-40 ). Certain of the convertible debentures have a variable exercise price, thus
are convertible into an indeterminate number of shares for which we cannot determine if we have sufficient authorized shares to
settle the transaction with. Accordingly, the embedded conversion option is a derivative liability and is marked to market through
earnings at the end of each reporting period. Any change in fair value during the period recorded in earnings as  Other income
(expense) - gain (loss) on change in derivative liabilities.  

The following table represents the Company s
derivative liability activity for the period ended: 

Commitments and Contingencies:  

In the normal course of business, the Company
is subject to loss contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of its business, that cover a wide range of
matters, including, among others, government investigations, environment liability and tax matters. An accrual for a loss contingency
is recognized when it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred and the amount of loss can be
reasonably estimated.

NOTE 1   
       
       ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION (Continued)    

Basic and Diluted Income (Loss) per Share  

Basic income (loss) per common share is computed
by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted
income (loss) per common share is computed similar to basic income per common share except that the denominator is increased to
include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued
and if the additional common shares were dilutive. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had debt instruments, options and warrants
outstanding that can potentially be converted into approximately 108,318,807 shares of common stock. 

Material Equity Instruments  

The Company evaluates stock options, stock warrants
and other contracts (convertible promissory note payable) to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts
qualify as derivative financial instruments to be separately accounted for under the relevant sections of  ASC 815-40, Derivative
Instruments and Hedging: Contracts in Entity s Own Equity ( ASC 815 ).  The result of this accounting
treatment could be that the fair value of a financial instrument is classified as a derivative financial instrument and is marked-to-market
at each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, the change
in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as other income or other expense. Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative
financial instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to
equity. Financial instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification under ASC 815 are
reclassified to a liability account at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date. 

Certain of the Company s
embedded conversion features on debt and outstanding warrants are treated as derivative liabilities for accounting purposes under
ASC 815-40 due to insufficient authorized shares to settle these outstanding contracts. Pursuant to SEC staff guidance that
permits a sequencing approach based on the use of ASC 840-15-25 which provides guidance for contracts that permit partial net share
settlement. The sequencing approach may be applied in one of two ways: contracts may be evaluated based on (1) earliest issuance
date or (2) latest maturity date. In the case of insufficient authorized share capital available to fully settle outstanding
contracts, the Company utilizes the earliest maturity date sequencing method to reclassify outstanding contracts as derivative
instruments. These contracts are recognized currently in earnings until such time as the convertible notes or warrants are
exercised, expire, the related rights have been waived and/or the authorized share capital has been amended to accommodate settlement
of these contracts. These instruments do not trade in an active securities market.

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements  

In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting
standard update which requires, among other things, that entities measure equity investments (except those accounted for under
the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) at fair value, with changes in fair value
recognized in earnings. Under the standard, entities will no longer be able to recognize unrealized holding gains and losses on
equity securities classified today as available for sale as a component of other comprehensive income. For equity investments without
readily determinable fair values the cost method of accounting is also eliminated, however subject to certain exceptions, entities
will be able to elect to record equity investments without readily determinable fair values at cost, less impairment and plus or
minus adjustments for observable price changes, with all such changes recognized in earnings. This new standard does not change
the guidance for classifying and measuring investments in debt securities and loans. The standard is effective for us on July 1,
2018 (the first quarter of our 2019 fiscal year). The Company is currently evaluating the anticipated impact of this standard on
our financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,
Leases (Topic 842) to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities
on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Topic 842 affects any entity that enters into a
lease, with some specified scope exemptions. The guidance in this Update supersedes Topic 840, Leases. The core principle of Topic
842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. A lessee should recognize in the statement
of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right
to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For public companies, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact
of adopting ASU No. 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements. 

In March
2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations
(Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  that clarifies how to apply revenue recognition guidance related to whether an entity
is a principal or an agent. ASU 2016-08 clarifies that the analysis must focus on whether the entity has control of the goods or
services before they are transferred to the customer and provides additional guidance about how to apply the control principle
when services are provided and when goods or services are combined with other goods or services. The effective date for ASU 2016-08
is the same as the effective date of ASU 2014-09  as   amended by ASU 2015-14 ,  for
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods  within
those years.  The Company has not yet determined the impact of  ASU 2016-08
on its  consolidated  financial statements.  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,
Compensation   Stock Compensation, or ASU No. 2016-09. The areas for simplification in this Update involve several aspects
of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either
equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public entities, the amendments in this Update are
effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption
is permitted in any interim or annual period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should
be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must
adopt all of the amendments in the same period. Amendments related to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized, minimum
statutory withholding requirements, forfeitures, and intrinsic value should be applied using a modified retrospective transition
method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is adopted.
Amendments related to the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares
to meet the minimum statutory withholding requirement should be applied retrospectively. Amendments requiring recognition of excess
tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement and the practical expedient for estimating expected term should be applied
prospectively. An entity may elect to apply the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement
of cash flows using either a prospective transition method or a retrospective transition method. We are currently evaluating the
impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-09 on our consolidated financial statements. 

In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,  Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing , which provides further guidance
on identifying performance obligations and improves the operability and understandability of licensing implementation guidance.
The effective date for ASU 2016-10 is the same as the effective date of ASU 2014-09 as   amended by ASU 2015-14 ,  for
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods  within
those years.  The Company has not yet determined the impact of  ASU 2016-10
on its  consolidated  financial statements.

of $206,996 was allocated as a debt discount $76,163 was determined using intrinsic value with the remainder $130,833 charged to

and initially in the advertising and product merchandising markets. The systems display a moving 3D image size to forty inches
in front of the display, projecting a digital video image out into space detached from any screen, rendering truly independent
floating images featuring high definition and crisp visibility from far distances. The nearest comparable to this technology can
be seen in motion pictures such as Star Wars and Minority Report, where objects and humans are represented through full-motion
holograms. In addition to selling the hardware for our patented three-dimensional, holographic interactive video displays, we are
building our business into a digital media company offering advertising on a network of our 3D holographic video displays and integrating
them into Provision s 3D Savings Center kiosks. 

We have a limited operating history upon which
an investor can evaluate our business prospects, which makes it difficult to forecast our future operating results, in light of
the risks, uncertainties and problems frequently encountered by companies with limited operating histories. These include, but
are not limited to, competition, the need to develop customers and market expertise, market conditions, sales, and marketing and
governmental regulation. 

We were incorporated in Nevada under the name
MailTec, Inc. on February 9, 2004. Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated February 14, 2008, which was amended and
restated on February 27, 2008 (as amended and restated, the  Agreement ), MailTec, Inc. with ProVision Merger Corp.,
a Nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the  Subsidiary ) and Provision Interactive Technologies,
Inc., a California corporation ( ProVision ), the Subsidiary merged into ProVision, and ProVision became a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company. As consideration for the merger of the Subsidiary into ProVision, the Company issued 20,879,350 shares
of the Company s common stock to the shareholders, creditors, and certain warrant holders of ProVision, representing
approximately 86.5% of the Company s aggregate issued and outstanding common stock, and the outstanding shares and debt,
and those warrants whose holders received shares of the Company s common stock, of ProVision were transferred to the Company
and cancelled. Effective February 28, 2008, pursuant to the Agreement, ProVision became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
At the time of the reverse acquisition, MailTec was not engaged in any active business. 

Our corporate headquarters are located in Chatsworth,
California and our phone number is (818) 775-1624.

Products and Services  

We believe we are well positioned to capitalize
on advertisers  demands as ProVision s HoloVision  display and 3D Savings Center kiosks offer advertisers and
customers an opportunity to reach a highly sought-after, captive audience outside the home, in familiar settings like grocery stores,
malls, convenience stores, gas stations, banks and other retail locations. We reach the consumer and business professional at the
critical time - when they are away from their homes and businesses and when they are making their buying decisions. 

ProVision is marketing our patented three-dimensional,
holographic interactive video display and is also developing and marketing several new point-of-purchase, and other devices, tailored
to specific industries with major international companies or readying to begin shortly; including the medical, entertainment, government
and home markets. ProVision s floating image display technologies have multiple potential market applications across a broad
spectrum of industries. In addition to hardware sales, we are initially focusing our efforts on the point-of-purchase and advertising
markets. 

ProVision s HoloVision  display
can be used for a number of applications, including: 

Retail   
       
       Education   
       
       Medical

The projected and estimated economic model for
retail stores utilizing a kiosk application is (on a per machine basis): 

The monthly operating profit per machine would
be reduced by the financing costs, such as a lease of the machine or funding through a joint venture such as Pro Dava 3D. 

Business Development  

Launching our first products into grocery stores
and retail pharmacies, we have developed a new patented application. Known as the  3D Savings Center , this ProVision
device projects 3D video advertisements and allows consumers to print coupons as well as receive non-cash awards. The 3D Savings
Center kiosk provides consumer product goods companies and other advertisers with a new way of promoting their products at the
point of purchase, where consumers are making 70% (seventy percent) of their buying decisions. 

We tested our concept in Fred Meyer Stores,
a division of The Kroger, Co., installing 3D Savings Center kiosks in the Pacific Northwest. We received advertising placements
from some of the largest manufacturers in the country, including Unilever, Proctor   Gamble, Johnson   Johnson, BIC and
Kimberly Clark. The Company has published a case study of this successful market trial which is available from the Company. 

We have now aligned a retail chain, a hardware
purchaser to buy 3D Savings Center kiosks to install into the retail chain and advertising agencies to sell ads for the 3D Savings
Center kiosks and expect to generate additional revenue from hardware sales in the year ended June 30, 2016 and significant advertising
sales thereafter. 

22  

Rite Aid Pharmacies   

We plan to build, own, and operate networks
of 3D Savings Center kiosks.  In April 2013 we have an agreement with Rite Aid Pharmacies ( Rite Aid ) to install
3D Savings Centers kiosks in all participating Rite Aid stores throughout the United States. We successfully completed the pilot
test phase with nine stores in Los Angeles, and have completed the manufacturing of, and received payment for, the first 200 3D
Savings Center kiosks in March 2015. The Company began shipping the first 200 kiosks to be installed in stores at the end of March
2015. We have now shipped an additional 250 3D Savings Center  kiosks to its retail partner.  These kiosks are being
installed in New York, Los Angeles, Detroit, Philadelphia and San Francisco retail locations.   Upon installation, which
will be an ongoing process through February 2016, the Company will have 450 3D kiosks in five cities furthering its ability to
promote both national and local consumer brands through paid advertising.  With the successful incorporation of Rite Aid s
wellness and loyalty program, now known as  Plenti onto the 3D Savings Center kiosks in New York and Los Angeles, we
will then continue to expand to 1,000 stores in Rite Aid s top 10 demographic markets. The Company
will earn advertising revenue from advertisements in Rite Aid. 

ProDava 3D   

On June 30, 2014 the Company entered into an
agreement with DB Dava, LLC ( DB ) to help the Company launch the 3D network in Rite Aid. The agreement creates a newly-formed
entity, ProDava 3D, LLC ( ProDava 3D ), to purchase Provision s 3D Savings Center kiosks for placement into Rite
Aid stores. ProDava 3D may purchase up to $50 million in 3D Savings Center kiosks. The Company generated revenues and gross profit
from the sale of machines to ProDava 3D during the three ended September 30, 2016. The Company will also will earn advertising
revenue from advertisements in Rite Aid earned by ProDava 3D. 

ProDava 3D is purchasing 3D Savings Center kiosks,
manufactured by Provision. These will be placed in high traffic aisles of nationally recognized retail stores, initially Rite Aid,
with advertisements of consumer packaged products, other consumer goods manufacturers along with local/regional advertisers. Ad
sales inventory will include marquee 3D hologram images, coupons, and other rewards and transactions of products sold in the stores
(focused on new product introductions). 

Provision s contribution to ProDava 3D
includes Provision s know-how, management, and its agreement with the national retail pharmacy that will be the first target
for the 3D Savings Center kiosk launch. Provision will be responsible for manufacturing, installation, service, maintenance, technical
support, network management, advertising, marketing, and accounting of each 3D Savings Center kiosk for the joint venture. Provision
will be compensated for rendering and performing all of these services. The advertising and other revenues generated from the 3D
Savings Center kiosks will be divided among Provision and DB. 

Advertising Agencies   

Provision has engaged TSQ LL (TSQ)
and GRI LLC (GRC) to provide non-exclusive national advertising sales to the OTC (over-the-counter) and DTC (direct-to-consumer)
brands in support of the 3D Saving Center kiosks being deployed inside Rite Aid. 

We have also engaged Pharmark, Inc.
to provide local and regional advertising sales to support the 3D Savings Center kiosks in retail stores. The clients of Pharmark
will provide local coupons, promotions and other advertising campaigns in digital format expanding advertising to include local
merchants joining national brands. 

Other Business Arrangements   

The Company has signed a Master Collaboration
Agreement with Intel Corporation to identify and collaborate on certain technical and marketing activities as contained in the
agreement. Collaboration includes joint technical development and marketing activities as determined by the two companies. 

The Company has signed a Master Service Agreement
with Fujifilm Corporation to provide to Company and its customers with installation and maintenance services to the Company s
3D Savings Center Kiosks inside Rite Aid retail stores. 

In April 2014, Provision announced that it has
shipped its first two 3D Holovision displays, models HL40D and HL17MD to an international shopping center group. Operating one
of the world s largest shopping center portfolios with interests in 90 shopping centers around the world, the group is testing
Provision s 3D holographic display as a potential marketing tool, including the use of interactive features. 

23  

Competition  

Currently, Provision s competition is
no other 3D companies that may exist in the marketplace, but traditional advertising media like television, radio, newspapers and
magazines.  We also compete with companies that operate outdoor and Digital Out-Of-Home (DOOH) advertising media networks
that can be seen at malls, gas stations, and retailers containing traditional 2D (two dimensional) TV screens or flat screens.
We also compete for overall advertising spending with other alternative advertising media companies, such as Internet, billboard
and public transport advertising companies. 

The competition for ProVision s patented
(issued, approved and pending) and proprietary 3D floating image holographic technology includes alternative 3D displays currently
in the marketplace: 

Employees  

As of September 30, 2016 we have seven employees.
None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider relations with
our employees to be good. The company also uses independent contractors to support administration, marketing, sales and field support
activities. 

Research and Development  

Research and Development Activities  

At present, Provision s patents and patent
applications are supplemented by substantial intellectual property we are currently protecting as trade secrets and proprietary
know-how. This includes matter related to all product lines. We expect to file additional patent applications on a regular basis
in the future. 

Intellectual Property  

ProVision s floating image display
systems project full-motion 3D digital streaming media 9 - 40  into space  detached  from the display
unit into free space and should not be confused with autostereoscopic systems. Autostereoscopic 3D systems produced by various
firms  layer two or more LCD screens, or lenticular lens based screens, while utilizing filters and collumnators to provide
the  illusion  of depth perception. Such systems are only capable of displaying digital content attached to layered
screens with all images being contained within the actual display unit. Due to the inherent nature of this technology approach
the end result of their product line results in the following characteristics: eye strain, nausea, low resolution, low brightness
and poor quality imagery, all resulting in poor/low customer acceptance. The cost to produce custom and special content for these
screens are excessively expensive and time consuming becoming a major hurdle to overcome for mass adoption. Their major advantage
might be characterized by their  flat screens  and slightly wider viewing angles, however consumer acceptance has been
limited due to the limitations and poor visual experience. Companies attempting to launch these screens include 3D Magnetec, Alisoscopy,
Tridelity, and 3D Fusion. Companies that have tried to launch these types of screens, and have failed or ceased operations, include:
Phillips, Sharp, and Newsight. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016
COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015   

The following table sets forth, for the periods
indicated, certain data derived from our Statements of Operations: 

24  

REVENUES   

The Company recognizes revenues from hardware
sales, advertising and from licensing, distribution and marketing agreements. Revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2016
were $58,712, a decrease of $1,111,754 from $1,170,466 generated in the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in revenues
was primarily from a decrease in related party sales. The related party revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016
is amortization of a long-term software contract on sales to ProDava 3D, LLC related to the purchase of Provision s 3D Savings
Center kiosks for placement into retail stores. The related party revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2015 is for
sales to ProDava 3D, LLC to purchase Provision s 3D Savings Center kiosks for placement into retail stores. During the three
ended September 30, 2016 the Company had one customer which accounted for 10% of the Company s revenues (85%). During
the three ended September 30, 2015 the Company had one customer which accounted for 10% of the Company s revenues (96%). 

     COST OF REVENUES   

Cost of revenues for the quarter ended September
30, 2016 was $56,027 as compared to $919,952 incurred in the quarter ended September 30, 2015. Cost of revenues for the quarter
ended September 30, 2016 decreased as a direct result of the corresponding decrease in related party sales. 

OPERATING EXPENSES   

The Company incurred $972,941 in operating expenses
for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, an increase from $330,265 incurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2015 primarily
as a result of a $524,613 increase in general and administrative expenses while research and development expenses increased $118,063.
General and administrative expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 increased primarily as a result of the fees for independent
contractors and consultants for the Company s operations and additional marketing agreements. 

OTHER EXPENSES    

The Company also recorded additional $360,824
of interest expense and amortization of debt and warrant discounts and finance costs during the quarter ended September 30, 2016
compared to the comparable quarter in 2015, related to the convertible notes outstanding. The Company recognized a gain of $592,312
for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 from the extinguishment of debt of a previously recorded contingency loss after it filed
a lawsuit and was awarded a default judgement in its favor from a dispute that started in 2004 with Betacorp Management, Inc. The
Company recognized a gain of $5,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 due to the forgiveness of certain debts to vendors. 

   NET LOSS:   

The Company had a net loss of $1,623,527 for
the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to net income of $82,173 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The increase in
net loss in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was primarily a result of higher interest expense by $360,824 and increased operating
expenses by $642,676, along with the decrease in gross profit of $247,829. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

The financial statements in this Form 10-Q are
presented on the basis that the Company is a going concern. Going concern contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business over a reasonable length of time. The Company had accumulated deficit at September
30, 2016 of $36,381,789. The Company has negative working capital of $8,963,910 as of September 30, 2016. The largest balances
in current liabilities are for accrued interest $2,570,052, unearned revenue $3,369,774 and the current portion of convertible
debt in the amount of $4,928,968. The Company is in the process of negotiating with noteholders to convert accrued interest into
long-term notes to reduce current liabilities and plans to ship goods to reduce the unearned revenue. 

25  

The condensed consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company's continuation
as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis, to
obtain additional financing or refinancing as may be required and, ultimately, to attain profitable operations. Management s
plan to eliminate the going concern situation include, but are not limited to, the raise of additional capital through issuance
of debt and equity, improved cash flow management, aggressive cost reductions, and the creation of additional sales and profits
across its product lines. 

 The Company does have $1,127,825 in cash as
of September 30, 2016. The Company has sufficient cash to operate for the next 12 months. Failure to raise additional capital or
improve its performance in the next 12 months, however, may cause the Company to curtail its business activities and expansion
plans within the next twelve months. 

During the three months ended September 30,
2016, the Company used $1,030,923 of cash for operating activities compared to a use of $262,802 in the three months ended September
30, 2015. The increase in cash used for operating activities was due a higher net loss and the use of cash to lower accounts payable
and accrued liabilities. Cash used by financing activities was $16,795 in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to
cash from financing activities of $1,937,170 during the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

On June 30, 2014 the Company entered into an
agreement with DB Dava, LLC ( DB ) to help the Company launch the 3D network in Rite Aid. The agreement creates a newly-formed
entity, ProDava 3D, LLC ( ProDava 3D ), to purchase Provision s 3D Savings Center kiosks for placement into Rite
Aid stores. ProDava 3D may purchase up to $50 million in 3D Savings Center kiosks. The agreement calls for an initial purchase
of $2 million of 3D Savings Center kiosks. The Company will generate revenues and gross profit from the sale of machines to ProDava
3D. The Company will also earn advertising revenue from advertisements in Rite Aid earned by ProDava 3D. 

ProDava 3D is purchasing 3D Savings Center kiosks,
manufactured by Provision. These will be placed in high traffic aisles of nationally recognized retail stores, initially Rite Aid,
with advertisements of consumer packaged products, other consumer goods manufacturers along with local/regional advertisers. Ad
sales inventory will include marquee 3D hologram images, coupons, and other rewards and transactions of products sold in the stores
(focused on new product introductions). 

Provision s contribution to ProDava 3D
includes Provision s know-how, management, and its agreement with the national retail pharmacy that will be the first target
for the 3D Savings Center kiosk launch. Provision will be responsible for manufacturing, installation, service, maintenance, technical
support, network management, advertising, marketing, and accounting of each 3D Savings Center kiosk for the joint venture. Provision
will be compensated for rendering and performing all of these services. The advertising and other revenues generated from the 3D
Savings Center kiosks will be divided among Provision and DB. 

CRITICAL
ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS   

The preparation of the Company s financial
statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management
evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to receivables and accrued expenses. Management bases its estimates
and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable based on the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The most significant accounting estimates
inherent in the preparation of the Company s financial statements include estimates as to the appropriate carrying value
of the Company s intangible assets, the amount of stock compensation, and the amount of accrued liabilities that are not
readily attainable from other sources. These accounting policies are described at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis
and in the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

The Company considers all highly liquid investments,
with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased, to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30,
2016, the Company s cash and cash equivalents were on deposit in federally insured financial institutions, and at times may
exceed federally insured limits. 

26  

Accounts Receivable  

Accounts receivable are not collateralized and
interest is not accrued on past due accounts. Periodically, management reviews the adequacy of its provision for doubtful accounts
based on historical bad debt expense results and current economic conditions using factors based on the aging of its accounts receivable.
After management has exhausted all collection efforts, management writes off receivables and the related reserve. Additionally,
the Company may identify additional allowance requirements based on indications that a specific customer may be experiencing financial
difficulties. Actual bad debt results could differ materially from these estimates. 

Inventories  

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
(first-in, first-out) or market. The Company periodically reviews its inventories for indications of slow movement and obsolescence
and records an allowance when it is deemed necessary. 

Property and Equipment  

Property and equipment are stated at cost. When
retired or otherwise disposed, the related carrying value and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts
and the net difference less any amount realized from disposition, is reflected in earnings. For financial statement purposes, property
and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Long-lived
tangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying value of
the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are recognized based on estimated fair values if the sum of expected future
undiscounted cash flows of the related assets is less than their carrying values. 

Intangibles  

Intangibles represent primarily costs incurred
in connection with patent applications. Such costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the useful life of the patent
once issued, or expensed immediately if any specific application is unsuccessful. 

Revenue Recognition  

The Company recognizes gross sales when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, title transfer has occurred, the price is fixed or readily determinable, and collection is probable. It
recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 605, Revenue Recognition ( ASC
605 ). Revenue from licensing, distribution and marketing agreements is recognized over the term of the contract. Revenue
from the sale of hardware is recognized when the product is complete and the buyer has accepted delivery. Provisions for discounts
and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related
sales are recorded. 

Cost of Revenue  

Cost of revenue in respect to sale of hardware
consists of costs associated with manufacturing of 3D displays, Kiosk machine, transportation, and other costs that are directly
related to a revenue-generating. Such expenses are classified as cost of revenue in the corresponding period in which the revenue
is recognized in the accompanying income statement. 

Depreciation and Amortization  

The Company depreciates its property and equipment
using the straight-line method with estimated useful lives from three to seven years. For federal income tax purposes, depreciation
is computed using an accelerated method. 

Shipping and Handling Costs  

The Company s policy is to classify shipping
and handling costs as a component of Costs of Revenues in the Statement of Operations. 

Unearned Revenue  

The Company bills customers in advance for certain
of its services. If the customer makes payment before the service is rendered to the customer, the Company records the payment
in a liability account entitled customer prepayments and recognizes the revenue related to the services when the customer receives
and utilizes that service, at which time the earnings process is complete. The Company recorded $3,369,774 and $3,419,616 as of
September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively as deferred revenue. 

27  

Significant Customers  

During the three months ended
September 30, 2016 the Company had one customer which accounted for more than 10% of the Company s revenues (85%). During
the three months ended September 30, 2015 the Company had one customer which accounted for more than 10% of the Company s
revenues (96%).  

  Research and Development Costs  

The Company charges all research and development
costs to expense when incurred. Manufacturing costs associated with the development of a new process or a new product are expensed
until such times as these processes or products are proven through final testing and initial acceptance by the customer. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, the Company incurred $150,132 and $32,069, respectively for research and development expense which are included in the
unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

Fair value estimates discussed herein are based
upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016. The
respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments, approximate their fair values. These financial instruments
include cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and notes payable. Fair values were assumed to approximate
carrying values for these financial instruments because they are short term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair
values or they are receivable or payable on demand. 

The Company uses fair value measurements under
the three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure for fair value measures.
The three levels are defined as follows: 

Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.   

Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.   

Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value.   

The following table provides a summary of the
changes in fair value of the Company s Promissory Notes, which are both Level 3 liabilities as of September 30, 2016: 

The Company determined the value of its convertible
notes using a market interest rate and the value of the warrants and beneficial conversion feature issued at the time of the transaction
less the accretion. There is no active market for the debt and the value was based on the delayed payment terms in addition to
other facts and circumstances at the end of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016.  

28  

Derivative Financial Instruments  

The Company evaluates our financial instruments
to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial
instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then
re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. For stock-based derivative
financial instruments, the Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model to value the derivative instruments. The classification
of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the
end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based
on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. 

Certain of the Company s embedded conversion
features on debt and outstanding warrants are treated as derivative liabilities for accounting purposes under ASC 815 due to insufficient
authorized shares to settle these outstanding contracts, or due to other rights connected with these contracts, such as registration
rights. In the case of insufficient authorized share capital available to fully settle outstanding contracts, the Company utilizes
the latest maturity date sequencing method to reclassify outstanding contracts as derivative instruments. These contracts are recognized
currently in earnings until such time as the warrants are exercised, expire, the related rights have been waived and/or the authorized
share capital has been amended to accommodate settlement of these contracts. These instruments do not trade in an active securities
market. 

The classification of derivative instruments,
including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting
period. Derivative instruments that become subject to reclassification are reclassified at the fair value of the instrument on
the reclassification date. Derivative instrument liabilities will be classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current
based on whether or not settlement of the derivative instrument is expected within 12 months of the balance sheet date.  

The Company estimates the fair value of these
instruments using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the intrinsic value if the convertible notes are due on demand. 

We have determined that certain convertible
debt instruments outstanding as of the date of these financial statements include an exercise price  reset  adjustment
that qualifies as derivative financial instruments under the provisions of ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in an
Entity s Own Stock ( ASC 815-40 ). Certain of the convertible debentures have a variable exercise price, thus
are convertible into an indeterminate number of shares for which we cannot determine if we have sufficient authorized shares to
settle the transaction with. Accordingly, the embedded conversion option is a derivative liability and is marked to market through
earnings at the end of each reporting period. Any change in fair value during the period recorded in earnings as  Other income
(expense) - gain (loss) on change in derivative liabilities.  

The following table represents the Company s
derivative liability activity for the period ended: 

Commitments and Contingencies:  

In the normal course of business, the Company
is subject to loss contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of its business, that cover a wide range of
matters, including, among others, government investigations, environment liability and tax matters. An accrual for a loss contingency
is recognized when it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred and the amount of loss can be
reasonably estimated. 

Basic and Diluted Income (Loss) per Share  

Basic income (loss) per common share is computed
by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted
income (loss) per common share is computed similar to basic income per common share except that the denominator is increased to
include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued
and if the additional common shares were dilutive. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had debt instruments, options and warrants
outstanding that can potentially be converted into approximately 108,318,807 shares of common stock. 

29  

Material Equity Instruments  

The Company evaluates stock options, stock warrants
and other contracts (convertible promissory note payable) to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts
qualify as derivative financial instruments to be separately accounted for under the relevant sections of  ASC 815-40, Derivative
Instruments and Hedging: Contracts in Entity s Own Equity ( ASC 815 ).  The result of this accounting
treatment could be that the fair value of a financial instrument is classified as a derivative financial instrument and is marked-to-market
at each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, the change
in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as other income or other expense. Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative
financial instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to
equity. Financial instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification under ASC 815 are
reclassified to a liability account at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date. 

Certain of the Company s
embedded conversion features on debt and outstanding warrants are treated as derivative liabilities for accounting purposes under
ASC 815-40 due to insufficient authorized shares to settle these outstanding contracts. Pursuant to SEC staff guidance that
permits a sequencing approach based on the use of ASC 840-15-25 which provides guidance for contracts that permit partial net share
settlement. The sequencing approach may be applied in one of two ways: contracts may be evaluated based on (1) earliest issuance
date or (2) latest maturity date. In the case of insufficient authorized share capital available to fully settle outstanding
contracts, the Company utilizes the earliest maturity date sequencing method to reclassify outstanding contracts as derivative
instruments. These contracts are recognized currently in earnings until such time as the convertible notes or warrants are
exercised, expire, the related rights have been waived and/or the authorized share capital has been amended to accommodate settlement
of these contracts. These instruments do not trade in an active securities market. 

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements  

In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting
standard update which requires, among other things, that entities measure equity investments (except those accounted for under
the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) at fair value, with changes in fair value
recognized in earnings. Under the standard, entities will no longer be able to recognize unrealized holding gains and losses on
equity securities classified today as available for sale as a component of other comprehensive income. For equity investments without
readily determinable fair values the cost method of accounting is also eliminated, however subject to certain exceptions, entities
will be able to elect to record equity investments without readily determinable fair values at cost, less impairment and plus or
minus adjustments for observable price changes, with all such changes recognized in earnings. This new standard does not change
the guidance for classifying and measuring investments in debt securities and loans. The standard is effective for us on July 1,
2018 (the first quarter of our 2019 fiscal year). The Company is currently evaluating the anticipated impact of this standard on
our financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,
Leases (Topic 842) to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities
on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Topic 842 affects any entity that enters into a
lease, with some specified scope exemptions. The guidance in this Update supersedes Topic 840, Leases. The core principle of Topic
842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. A lessee should recognize in the statement
of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right
to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For public companies, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact
of adopting ASU No. 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements. 

In March
2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations
(Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  that clarifies how to apply revenue recognition guidance related to whether an entity
is a principal or an agent. ASU 2016-08 clarifies that the analysis must focus on whether the entity has control of the goods or
services before they are transferred to the customer and provides additional guidance about how to apply the control principle
when services are provided and when goods or services are combined with other goods or services. The effective date for ASU 2016-08
is the same as the effective date of ASU 2014-09  as   amended by ASU 2015-14 ,  for
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods  within
those years.  The Company has not yet determined the impact of  ASU 2016-08
on its  consolidated  financial statements.  

30  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,
Compensation   Stock Compensation, or ASU No. 2016-09. The areas for simplification in this Update involve several aspects
of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either
equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public entities, the amendments in this Update are
effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption
is permitted in any interim or annual period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should
be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must
adopt all of the amendments in the same period. Amendments related to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized, minimum
statutory withholding requirements, forfeitures, and intrinsic value should be applied using a modified retrospective transition
method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is adopted.
Amendments related to the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares
to meet the minimum statutory withholding requirement should be applied retrospectively. Amendments requiring recognition of excess
tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement and the practical expedient for estimating expected term should be applied
prospectively. An entity may elect to apply the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement
of cash flows using either a prospective transition method or a retrospective transition method. We are currently evaluating the
impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-09 on our consolidated financial statements. 

In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,  Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing , which provides further guidance
on identifying performance obligations and improves the operability and understandability of licensing implementation guidance.
The effective date for ASU 2016-10 is the same as the effective date of ASU 2014-09 as   amended by ASU 2015-14 ,  for
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods  within
those years.  The Company has not yet determined the impact of  ASU 2016-10
on its  consolidated  financial statements.  

ECONOMY AND INFLATION  

Except as disclosed herein, we have not experienced
any significant cancellation of orders due to the downturn in the economy and only a small number of customers requested delays
in delivery or production of orders in process. Our management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on our results
of operations. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET AND CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS  

We do not have any off balance sheet or contractual
arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, and results of
operations, liquidity or capital expenditures. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK  

Not applicable. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision
and with the participation of our Company s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the design and
effectiveness of our  disclosure controls and procedures  (as defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on this evaluation, our Principal Executive
Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, these disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act
reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the SEC and
is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

The matters involving internal controls and
procedures that the Company s management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board are as follows: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company s
board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures;
(2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; (3) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting
and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (4) ineffective
controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. The Company intends to establish policies and procedures
that will remediate the related material weaknesses. 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial
Reporting  

There have been no changes in our internal controls
over financial reporting during our last fiscal three months that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

31  

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  

In the ordinary course of business, the Company
may become a party to various legal proceedings generally involving contractual matters, infringement actions, product liability
claims and other matters. There are no material items of litigation at this time. 

ITEM 2.   UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND
USE OF PROCEEDS

30, 2016, the Company issued 1,066,667 shares of common stock in exchange for consulting services valued at $248,333.

30, 2016 the Company issued 6,761,312 shares of its common stock in payment of $699,575 debt and accrued interest.
