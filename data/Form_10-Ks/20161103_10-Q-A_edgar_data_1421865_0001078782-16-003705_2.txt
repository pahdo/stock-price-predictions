  NOTE 3   GOING CONCERN  
   
 The Company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern.

  NOTE 4 - CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE  
   
 As of May 31, 2016 the convertible notes payable consisted of: 

NOTE 5   DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES  
   
 In accordance with ASC 815, the Company has bifurcated the conversion feature of their convertible notes and recorded a derivative liability on the date each note became convertible. The derivative liability was then revalued on each reporting date. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value the derivative liability. There was no derivative liability at May 31, 2016. Once the loans are fully converted, the remaining derivative liability is reclassified to equity as additional paid-in capital.  
   
 ASC 815 requires Company management to assess the fair market value of certain derivatives at each reporting period and recognize any change in the fair market value as another income or expense item. The Company s only asset or liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis is its derivative liability associated with the above convertible debt. During the nine months ended May 31, 2016, the Company recorded a total change in the value of the derivative liabilities of $(346,125).  
   
 From inception to May 31, 2016 the Company has not granted any stock options.

   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   
   
 The following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operation for the nine month period ended May 31, 2016, and the factors that could affect our future financial condition. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. All references to dollar amounts in this section are in United States dollars unless expressly stated otherwise.   

11 

Revenue   
   
 Gross revenues for the three and nine month periods ended May 31, 2016, were $27,937 compared to $0 for the same periods in fiscal 2015.     These gross revenues were generated from a subcontracting agreement with Golden Eagle Construction Inc. 
   
   Operating Expenses   
   
 The primary decrease in the operating expenses for the three months ended May 31, 2016 over the same period in fiscal 2015 was the decreased professional expenses. This was partially offset by the increase in other general and administrative expenses.  
   
 The primary increase in the operating expenses for the nine months ended May 31, 2016 over the same period in fiscal 2015 was the increase in other general and administrative expenses accrued and paid in shares. This was partially offset by the decreased professional expenses. 
   
   Liquidity and Capital Resourc  e   
     
   Cash Flows   

The Company had cash of $90,107; accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $799,196, notes payable totalling $100,273, related party notes totalling $658,057 a derivative liability of $86,168 and accrued interest of $571,796. We also had interest expense of $105,587 for the nine months ended May 31, 2016 and an accumulated Net Loss of (2,047,024) as of May 31, 2016.   

12 

Cash Used In Operating Activities   
   
 The Company s cash balance of 90,107 as of May 31, 2016, is increase of $73,814 during the nine months ended as compared to $16,293 at August 31, 2015. 
     
   Going Concern   
   
 The audited financial statements for the year ended August 31, 2015, included in our annual report on the Form 10-K filed with Securities and Exchange Commission, have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that our company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.  The continuation of our Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from our shareholders, the ability of our Company to obtain necessary equity financing to achieve our operating objectives, and the attainment of profitable operations. As at May 31, 2016, our company has accumulated losses of $6,262,744 since inception. As we do not have sufficient funds for our planned operations, we will be required to raise additional funds for operations and expansion. Due to the uncertainty of our ability to meet our current operating expenses and the capital expenses noted above, in their report on the annual financial statements for the year ended August 31, 2015, our independent registered auditors included an explanatory paragraph regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements contain additional note disclosures describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure by our independent registered auditors. 
   
 The continuation of our business is dependent upon us raising additional financial support. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. 
   
  Future Financings  
   
 The company s operating budget to maintain the public entity reporting requirements is approximately $50,000. We continue to present to various funding groups the current opportunities in attempts to secure additional capital. 
   
 We anticipate that additional funding will be required in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock and/or preferred stock. However, we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to secure sufficient funding from the sale of our equity securities to fund our marketing plan and operations. At this time, we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to secure sufficient funding from the sale of our equity securities or through a loan from our directors to meet our obligations over the next twelve months. We do not have any arrangements in place for any future equity financing and continue to be dependent upon related party/shareholder funding. The Company plans to secure additional capital by the use of Notes Payable, Convertible Notes Payable, Private Placements, and partnerships and revenue sharing in future opportunities. This financing activity may lead to stock dilution and changes in control 
   
   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   
   
 We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.    
   
  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  
   
 Not Applicable.    
     
  Item 4T. Controls and Procedures.  
   
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedure  
   
 We have adopted and maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods required under the SEC s rules and forms and that the information is gathered and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

13 

The Company's Chief Executive Officer, who is its principal executive and chief financial officer, completed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) as of the end of the period (Feb 28, 2014) covered by this Form 10-Q. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer   CFO, has concluded the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this Form 10-Q were ineffective because of comments from the SEC that required additional disclosure and restatement of other disclosed information. 
   
 Based upon the evaluation of our controls, the chief executive officer/CFO has concluded that, the disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective providing reasonable assurance that material information relating to the company activity is communicated in sufficient detail.  Although, changes have been made to provide the level of detail that is required in the company filings based upon the SEC comments, the company is not prepared at this time to remove the ineffective status of the disclosure controls and procedures. The company will continue to work in these deficiencies. 
   
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  
   
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter ended February 29, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  
     
   PART II - OTHER INFORMATION      
     
  ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  
   
 None.     
       
  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.  
   
   Risks and Uncertainties   

THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER WE WILL CONTINUE OPERATIONS.  
   
 If we discontinue operations, you could lose your investment. Our auditors have discussed their uncertainty regarding our business operations in their audit report dated August 31, 2015. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next 12 months. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue in business. As such, we may have to cease operations and you could lose your entire investment. 
   
  WE LACK AN OPERATING HISTORY  
   
 There is no assurance that our future operations will result in continued profitable revenues. If we cannot generate sufficient revenues to operate profitably, our business will fail. We have very little operating history upon which an evaluation of our future success could be determined. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in generating revenues in the future.

OUR STOCK IS A PENNY STOCK. TRADING OF OUR STOCK MAY BE RESTRICTED BY THE SEC'S PENNY STOCK REGULATIONS AND THE FINRA'S SALES PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS, WHICH MAY LIMIT A STOCKHOLDER'S ABILITY TO BUY AND SELL OUR STOCK    
   
 Our stock is a penny stock. The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines  penny stock  to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and  accredited investors . The term  accredited investor  refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the     compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these l penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in, and limit the marketability of, our common stock. 
   
 In addition to the  penny stock  rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker- dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer's financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, the National Association of Securities Dealers believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The National Association of Securities Dealers' requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock       .
