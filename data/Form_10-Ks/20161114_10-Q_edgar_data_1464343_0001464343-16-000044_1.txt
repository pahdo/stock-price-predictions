  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
  September 30, 2016   and   2015    

1. 
     Description of Our Business 
       
  Our accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Atlanticus Holdings Corporation (the  Company ) and those entities we control. We are primarily focused on providing financial technology and related services. Through our subsidiaries, we provide technology and other support services to lenders who offer an array of financial products and services to consumers who may have been declined under traditional financing options.  In most cases, we invest in the receivables originated by lenders who utilize our technology platform and other related services.  As discussed further below, we reflect our business lines within   two   reportable segments:  Credit and Other Investments; and Auto Finance. See also Note 3,  Segment Reporting,  for further details. 
    
  Within our Credit and Other Investments segment, we facilitate consumer finance programs offered by our bank partners to originate consumer loans through multiple channels, including retail point-of-sale, direct mail solicitation, on-line and partnerships.  Currently, these products are all offered under the Fortiva brand.  In the retail credit (the "point-of-sale" operations) channel, we partner with retailers and service providers in various industries across the United States ("U.S.") to enable them to provide credit to their customers for the purchase of goods and services.  These services of our lending partners, are often extended to consumers who may have been declined under traditional financing options. We specialize in supporting this "second look" credit service in various industries across the U.S.  Additionally, we support lenders who market general purpose personal loans and credit cards (collectively, the "direct-to-consumer" operations) directly to consumers through additional channels enabling them to reach consumers through a diverse origination platform which includes direct mail, Internet-based marketing and through partnerships.  Using our infrastructure and technology platform, we also provide loan servicing activities, including risk management and customer service outsourcing for third parties.  
   Beyond these activities within our Credit and Other Investments segment, we continue to service portfolios of credit card receivables. One of our portfolios of credit card receivables is encumbered by non-recourse structured financing, and for this portfolio our principal remaining economic interest is the servicing compensation we receive as an offset against our servicing costs given that the likely future collections on the portfolio are insufficient to allow for full repayment of the financing.   
    
  Additionally, we report within our Credit and Other Investments segment the income earned from an investment in an equity-method investee that holds credit card receivables for which we are the servicer. 
    
  Lastly, we report within our Credit and Other Investments segment gains associated with investments previously made in consumer finance technology platforms.  These include investments in companies engaged in mobile technologies, marketplace lending and other financial technologies.  These investments are carried at the lower of cost or market valuation as of   September 30, 2016  .  Some of these investees have raised, and continue to seek, capital at valuations substantially in excess of our associated book value.  However, none of these companies are publicly-traded, there are no pending liquidity events, and ascribing value to these investments at this time would be speculative.  
    
  Within our Auto Finance segment, our CAR subsidiary operations principally purchase and service loans secured by automobiles from or for, and also provide floor plan financing for, a pre-qualified network of independent automotive dealers and automotive finance companies in the buy-here, pay-here, used car business.  We purchase auto loans at a discount and with dealer retentions or holdbacks that provide risk protection. Also within our Auto Finance segment, we are providing certain installment lending products in addition to our traditional loans secured by automobiles. 

2. 
    Significant Accounting Policies and Consolidated Financial Statement Components 
       
  The following is a summary of significant accounting policies we follow in preparing our consolidated financial statements, as well as a description of significant components of our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates 
    
  We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ( GAAP ).  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting  
  
   6 

     Table of Contents  

period. We base these estimates on information available to us as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. Certain estimates, such as credit losses, payment rates, costs of funds, discount rates and the yields earned on credit card receivables, significantly affect the reported amount of credit card receivables that we report at fair value and our notes payable associated with structured financings, at fair value; these estimates likewise affect the changes in these amounts reflected within our fees and related income on earning assets line item on our consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, estimates of future credit losses have a significant effect on loans and fees receivable, net, as shown on our consolidated balance sheets, as well as on the provision for losses on loans and fees receivable within our consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  We have eliminated all significant intercompany balances and transactions for financial reporting purposes. 
    
  Loans and Fees Receivable 
    
  Our loans and fees receivable include:  (1) loans and fees receivable, net; (2) loans and fees receivable, at fair value; and (3) loans and fees receivable pledged as collateral under structured financings, at fair value. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , the weighted average remaining accretion period for the $  21.2 million   and $  16.3 million  , respectively, of deferred revenue reflected in the above tables was   10 months   and   11 months  , respectively. 
  A roll-forward (in millions) of our allowance for uncollectible loans and fees receivable by class of receivable is as follows:

     Table of Contents

     Table of Contents  

An aging of our delinquent loans and fees receivable, gross (in millions) by class of receivable as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is as follows: 

Income Taxes  
    
  We experienced effective income tax benefit rates of   34.0%   and   47.3%   for the   three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to an effective income tax expense rate of   190.5%   and a negative effective income tax expense rate of    2.2%   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.  Our effective income tax benefit rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is below the statutory rate principally due to our accruals of interest and penalties on unpaid tax liabilities relative to our   $13.7 million   of pre-tax loss during this period.  Our effective income tax benefit rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is above the statutory rate principally due to the income of our U.K. subsidiary (1) that is not subject to tax in the U.S., and (2) the U.K. tax on which was fully offset by the release of U.K.  
  
   9 

     Table of Contents  

valuation allowances.  Our negative effective income tax expense rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 differs significantly from the statutory rate principally as a result of (1) the release of prior year accruals for uncertain tax positions and interest thereon due to a favorable effective settlement with the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) that we reached in February 2015 with respect to our 2012 tax year and the expiration of the statute of limitations for our 2011 tax year, and (2) our reversal of a portion of the interest and penalty accruals on tax liability assessments associated with our 2007 and 2008 IRS audits. With the exception of the February 2015 effective settlement with the IRS, the above factors likewise contributed to our negative effective income tax expense rate for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
    
                  As noted above, we report potential accrued interest and penalties related to both our accrued liabilities for uncertain tax positions and unpaid tax liabilities within our income tax benefit or expense line item on our consolidated statements of operations. We likewise report the reversal of such accrued interest and penalties within the income tax benefit or expense line item to the extent that we resolve our liabilities for uncertain tax positions or unpaid tax liabilities in a manner favorable to our accruals therefor.  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , our income tax expense includes   $0.2 million   and   $0.6 million  , respectively, accrued for income tax-related interest and penalties.  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , our income tax expense included   $0.0 million   and   $0.7 million  , respectively, accrued for income tax-related interest and penalties. 
    
  In December 2014, we reached a settlement with the IRS concerning the tax treatment of net operating losses that we incurred in 2007 and 2008 and carried back to obtain refunds of federal income taxes paid in earlier years dating back to 2003. Our net unpaid income tax assessment associated with that settlement was   $7.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  ; this amount excludes unpaid interest and penalties on the tax assessment, the accruals for which aggregated   $3.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  . The IRS is currently examining amended return claims we have made, which, if ultimately approved by the IRS or the courts, would eliminate the   $7.3 million   assessment and cause the reversal of the   $3.3 million   accrual we have made for interest and penalties thereon.  We have been informed that the IRS intends to deny our amended return claims. Once we receive their formal disallowance, we plan to protest the disallowance with IRS Appeals, and in litigation should we not receive favorable resolution of the matter with IRS Appeals.  As is customary, the IRS has filed a lien in respect of their assessment. 
    
  Fees and Related Income on Earning Assets 
    
  The components (in thousands) of our fees and related income on earning assets are as follows: 

The above changes in the fair value of loans and fees receivable recorded at fair value category exclude the impact of charge offs associated with these receivables which are separately stated in Net recovery of (losses upon) charge off of loans and fees receivable recorded at fair value, net of recoveries on our consolidated statements of operations.  See Note 6,  Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities,  for further discussion of these receivables and their effects on our consolidated statements of operations.  
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The guidance requires an assessment of credit losses based on expected rather than incurred losses.  This generally will result in the recognition of allowances for losses earlier than under current accounting guidance for trade and other receivables, held to maturity debt securities and other instruments. The standard will be adopted on a prospective basis with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance  
  
   10 

     Table of Contents  

is effective. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company has not yet determined the potential effects of adopting ASU 2016-13 on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07, Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting.  The ASU eliminates the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively, as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The ASU requires that the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee should be combined with the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and the equity method of accounting should be adopted as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. No retroactive adjustment of the investment is required.  The ASU also requires that an entity that has an available-for-sale equity security that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting recognize through earnings, the unrealized holding gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for use of the equity method.  The ASU is effective for us January 1, 2017.  The impact of adoption of this authoritative guidance is not expected to result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which would require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases, changing certain aspects of current lessor accounting, among other things. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We have not yet determined the potential effects of adopting ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued updated authoritative guidance related to debt issuance costs. The amendment modifies the presentation of unamortized debt issuance costs to present such amounts as a direct deduction from the face amount of the debt, similar to unamortized debt discounts and premiums, rather than as an asset. Amortization of the debt issuance costs continues to be reported as interest expense. The guidance was effective for us beginning January 1, 2016.  The impact of adoption of this authoritative guidance did not result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
           
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  ASU 2014-09 establishes a principles-based model under which revenue from a contract is allocated to the distinct performance obligations within the contract and recognized in income as each performance obligation is satisfied.  Additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract is also required. In August 2015, the FASB delayed the effective date by one year and the guidance will now be effective for annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2018 and early adoption is permitted.  We do not plan to early adopt the guidance.  We have not yet determined the potential effects of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements.   
    
  Subsequent Events 
    
  We evaluate subsequent events that occur after our consolidated balance sheet date but before our consolidated financial statements are issued. There are two types of subsequent events:  (1) recognized, or those that provide additional evidence with respect to conditions that existed at the date of the balance sheet, including the estimates inherent in the process of preparing financial statements; and (2) nonrecognized, or those that provide evidence with respect to conditions that did not exist at the date of the balance sheet but arose subsequent to that date.  We have evaluated subsequent events occurring after   September 30, 2016  , and based on our evaluation we did not identify any recognized or nonrecognized subsequent events that would have required further adjustments to our consolidated financial statements. 

3. 
    Segment Reporting 
       
  We operate primarily within   one   industry consisting of   two   reportable segments by which we manage our business. Our two reportable segments are:  Credit and Other Investments, and Auto Finance.  
    
  As of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we did not have a material amount of long-lived assets located outside of the U.S., and only a negligible portion of our revenues for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   were generated outside of the U.S. 
    
  We measure the profitability of our reportable segments based on their income after allocation of specific costs and corporate overhead; however, our segment results do not reflect any charges for internal capital allocations among our segments. Overhead costs are allocated based on headcounts and other applicable measures to better align costs with the associated revenues.

    Shareholders' Equity 
       
  Retired Shares 
    
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we repurchased and contemporaneously retired   39,580   and   14,176   shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of   $124,000   and   $55,718  , respectively, pursuant to both open market and private purchases and the return of stock by holders of equity incentive awards to pay tax withholding obligations. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we repurchased and contemporaneously retired   286,223   and   60,481   shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of   $869,000   and   $178,270  , respectively, pursuant to both open market and private purchases and the return of stock by holders of equity incentive awards to pay tax withholding obligations.  
    
  We had   1,459,233   loaned shares outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , which were originally lent in connection with our November 2005 issuance of convertible senior notes.  We retire lent shares as they are returned to us.

    Investment in Equity-Method Investee 
       
  Our equity-method investment outstanding at   September 30, 2016   consists of our   66.7%   interest in a joint venture formed to purchase a credit card receivable portfolio.  
    
  In the following tables, we summarize (in thousands) combined balance sheet and results of operations data for our equity-method investee:

    Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities 
       
  Valuations and Techniques for Assets 
    
  Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. The table below summarizes (in thousands) by fair value hierarchy the   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   fair values and carrying amounts of (1) our assets that are required to be carried at fair value in our consolidated financial statements and (2) our assets not carried at fair value, but for which fair value disclosures are required:

     Table of Contents  

(1) 
    For cash, deposits and other short-term investments (including our investments in rental merchandise), the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. 
       
  For those asset classes above that are required to be carried at fair value in our consolidated financial statements, gains and losses associated with fair value changes are detailed on our fees and related income on earning assets table within Note 2,  Significant Accounting Policies and Consolidated Financial Statement Components.   
    
  For Level 3 assets carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs, the following table presents (in thousands) a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  : 

The unrealized gains and losses for assets within the Level 3 category presented in the tables above include changes in fair value that are attributable to both observable and unobservable inputs.  Impacts related to foreign currency translation are included as a component of other operating expense on the consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  Net Revaluation of Loans and Fees Receivable.   We record the net revaluation of loans and fees receivable (including those pledged as collateral) in the fees and related income on earning assets category in our consolidated statements of operations, specifically as changes in fair value of loans and fees receivable recorded at fair value.

    Notes Payable 
       
  Notes Payable Associated with Structured Financings, at Fair Value 
    
  Scheduled (in millions) in the table below are (1) the carrying amount of our structured financing note secured by certain credit card receivables and reported at fair value as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , (2) the outstanding face amount of our structured financing note secured by certain credit card receivables and reported at fair value as of   September 30, 2016  , and (3) the carrying amount of the credit card receivables and restricted cash that provide the exclusive means of repayment for the note (i.e., lenders have recourse only to the specific credit card receivables and restricted cash underlying each respective facility and cannot look to our general credit for repayment) as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

Contractual payment allocations within these credit cards receivable structured financings provide for a priority distribution of cash flows to us to service the credit card receivables, a distribution of cash flows to pay interest and principal due on the notes, and a distribution of all excess cash flows (if any) to us. The structured financing facility in the above table is amortizing down along with collections of the underlying receivables and there are no provisions within the debt agreement that allow for acceleration or bullet repayment of the facility prior to its scheduled expiration date. The aggregate carrying amount of the credit card receivables and restricted cash that provide security for the   $14.4 million   in fair value of the structured financing note in the above table is   $14.4 million  , which means that we have   no   aggregate exposure to pre-tax equity loss associated with the above structured financing arrangement at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Beyond our role as servicer of the underlying assets within the credit cards receivable structured financings, we have provided no other financial or other support to the structures, and we have no explicit or implicit arrangements that could require us to provide financial support to the structures.

Notes Payable, at Face Value and Notes Payable to Related Parties 
    
  Other notes payable outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   that are secured by the financial and operating assets of either the borrower, another of our subsidiaries or both, include the following, scheduled (in millions); except as otherwise noted, the assets of our holding company (Atlanticus Holdings Corporation) are subject to creditor claims under these scheduled facilities: 

(1) 
    Loan is subject to certain affirmative covenants, including a coverage ratio, a leverage ratio and a collateral performance test, the failure of which could result in required early repayment of all or a portion of the outstanding balance by our CAR Auto Finance operations.  
              (2) 
    Loans are subject to certain affirmative covenants tied to default rates and other performance metrics the failure of which could result in required early repayment of the remaining unamortized balances of the notes. 
              (3) 
    These notes reflect modifications to either extend the maturity date, increase the loaned amount or both.  
              (4) 
    See below for additional information regarding this note.  
              (5) 
    Loan was repaid in October 2016.  See additional information below. 
          
  On November 26, 2014, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Dove Ventures, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company ( Dove ). The agreement provides for a senior secured term loan facility in an amount of up to   $40.0 million   at any time outstanding, consisting of (i) an initial term loan of   $20.0 million  , and (ii) additional term loans available in the sole discretion of Dove and upon our request, provided that the aggregate amount of all outstanding term loans does not exceed   $40.0 million  . On November 26, 2014, Dove funded the initial term loan of   20.0 million  .  In November 2015, the agreement was amended to extend the maturity date of the term loan to   November 22, 2016  .  All other terms remained unchanged. Additionally, on July 28, 2016, we obtained an additional term loan under the Loan and Security Agreement.  As a result,  the Loan and Security Agreement is fully drawn with   $40.0 million   outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Our obligations under the agreement are guaranteed by certain subsidiary guarantors and secured by a pledge of certain assets of ours and the subsidiary guarantors. The loans bear interest at the rate of   9.0%   per annum, payable monthly in arrears. The principal amount of these loans is payable in a single installment on   November 22, 2016   (as amended).  The agreement includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, as well as customary representations, warranties and events of default. Subject to certain conditions, we can prepay the principal amounts of these loans without premium or penalty.

Dove is a limited liability company owned by three trusts. David G. Hanna is the sole shareholder and the President of the corporation that serves as the sole trustee of one of the trusts, and David G. Hanna and members of his immediate family are the beneficiaries of this trust. Frank J. Hanna, III is the sole shareholder and the President of the corporation that serves as the sole trustee of the other two trusts, and Frank J. Hanna, III and members of his immediate family are the beneficiaries of these other two trusts. 
    
  In October 2016, the revolving credit facility underlying our CAR operations was repaid.  In connection with this repayment we entered into a new revolving credit facility that provides for $40.0 million in available financing which can be drawn to the extent of outstanding eligible principal receivables within the borrowing entities  operations and accrues interest at an annual rate equal to LIBOR plus the applicable margin, ranging from 2.4% to 3.0% based on the ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth.  The new facility matures on November 1, 2018.  The facility is subject to certain affirmative covenants, including a coverage ratio and a leverage ratio, the failure of which could result in required early repayment of all or a portion of the outstanding balance. The facility is secured by the general financial and operating assets of our CAR operations.

    Convertible Senior Notes 
       
  In May 2005, we issued   $250.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   3.625%   convertible senior notes due 2025 (   3.625%   convertible senior notes ), and in November 2005, we issued   $300.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   5.875%   convertible senior notes due 2035 ("  5.875%   convertible senior notes").  The   5.875%   convertible senior notes are (and, prior to redemption, the   3.625%   convertible senior notes were) unsecured, subordinate to existing and future secured obligations and structurally subordinate to existing and future claims of our subsidiaries' creditors. These notes (net of repurchases since the issuance dates) are reflected within convertible senior notes on our consolidated balance sheets.   No put rights exist under our   5.875%   convertible senior notes.   
    
  In June 2016 we repurchased   $4.5 million   aggregate principal amount of outstanding   5.875%   convertible senior notes for   $2.0 million   plus accrued interest from unrelated third parties.  The purchase resulted in a gain of   $1.0 million   (net of the notes  applicable share of deferred costs, which were written off in connection with the repurchases).  Upon acquisition, the notes were retired. 
    
  In May 2015 we redeemed the remainder of the outstanding   3.625%   convertible senior notes.  Subsequent to this redemption, only our   5.875%   convertible senior notes remain outstanding. 
    
  The following summarizes (in thousands) components of our consolidated balance sheets associated with our convertible senior notes:

    Commitments and Contingencies 
       
  General 
    
  Under finance products available in the point-of-sale and direct-to-consumer channels, consumers have the ability to borrow up to the maximum credit limit assigned to each individual s account.  Unfunded commitments under these products aggregated   $165.5 million   at   September 30, 2016  . We have never experienced a situation in which all borrowers have exercised their entire available line of credit at any given point in time, nor do we anticipate this will ever occur in the future.  Moreover, there would be a concurrent increase in assets should there be any exercise of these lines of credit.  We also have the effective right to reduce or cancel these available lines of credit at any time.  
    
  Additionally our CAR operations provide floor-plan financing for a pre-qualified network of independent automotive dealers and automotive finance companies in the buy-here, pay-here used car business.  The financings allow dealers and  
  
   22 

     Table of Contents  

finance companies to borrow up to the maximum pre-approved credit limit allowed in order to finance ongoing inventory needs.  These loans are secured by the underlying auto inventory and, in certain cases where we have other lending products outstanding with the dealer, are secured by the collateral under those lending arrangements as well, including any outstanding dealer reserves. As of   September 30, 2016  , CAR had unfunded outstanding floor-plan financing commitments totaling   $8.8 million  .  Each draw against unused commitments is reviewed for conformity to pre-established guidelines. 
    
  Under agreements with third-party originating and other financial institutions we have pledged security (collateral) related to their issuance of consumer credit and purchases thereunder, of which   $8.7 million   remains pledged as of   September 30, 2016   to support various ongoing contractual obligations.  Those obligations include, among other things, compliance with one of the European payment system s operating regulations and by-laws.  
    
  Under agreements with third-party originating and other financial institutions, we have agreed to indemnify the financial institutions for certain liabilities associated with the services we provide on behalf of the financial institutions such indemnification obligations generally being limited to instances in which we either (a) have been afforded the opportunity to defend against any potentially indemnifiable claims or (b) have reached agreement with the financial institutions regarding settlement of potentially indemnifiable claims.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have assessed the likelihood of any potential payments related to the aforementioned contingencies as remote. We will accrue liabilities related to these contingencies in any future period if and in which we assess the likelihood of an estimable payment as probable.  
    
  Total System Services, Inc. provides certain services to Atlanticus Services Corporation in both the U.S. and the U.K. as a system of record provider under agreements that extend through October 2022 and April 2017, respectively. If Atlanticus Services Corporation were to terminate its U.S. or U.K. relationship with Total System Services, Inc. prior to the contractual termination period, it would incur significant penalties (  $1.3 million   and   $0.8 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , respectively). 
    
  At December 31, 2015, we had an accrued liability of    3.4 million   (  $5.0 million  ) within our consolidated financial statements associated with a then-ongoing review by U.K. taxing authorities (HM Revenue and Customs or  HMRC ) of  value-added tax ("VAT") filings made by one of our U.K. subsidiaries. In February of 2016, we received correspondence from HMRC stating that it (1) had chosen to discontinue its review of our U.K. subsidiary s VAT filings with no changes to the returns as filed by our U.K. subsidiary, and (2) would be refunding VAT refund claims made by our U.K. subsidiary that had been suspended during the HMRC review. We subsequently received all of such refunds, and as such we reversed the    3.4 million   (  $5.0 million  ) of VAT review-related liabilities in the first quarter of 2016. 
       
  We also are subject to certain minimum payments under cancelable and non-cancelable lease arrangements.  For further information regarding these commitments, see Note 8, "Leases" to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
    
  Litigation 
    
  We are involved in various legal proceedings that are incidental to the conduct of our business, none of which are expected to be material to us.

    Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Controlling Interests Per Common Share 
       
  The following table sets forth the computations of net income per common share (in thousands, except per share data):

    The effect of dilutive stock compensation arrangements is shown only for informational purposes where we are in a net loss position.  In such situations, the effect of including outstanding options and restricted stock would be anti-dilutive, and they are thus excluded from all loss period calculations. 
       
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were   no   shares potentially issuable and thus includible in the diluted net income attributable to controlling interests per common share calculations pursuant to our   5.875%   convertible senior notes. However, in future reporting periods during which our closing stock price is above the   $24.61   conversion price for the   5.875%   convertible senior notes, and depending on the closing stock price at conversion, the maximum potential dilution under the conversion provisions of such notes is   3.6 million   shares, which could be included in diluted share counts in net income per common share calculations. See Note 8,  Convertible Senior Notes,  for a further discussion of these convertible securities. 

11. 
    Stock-Based Compensation 
       
  We currently have   two   stock-based compensation plans, the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the  ESPP ) and the Amended and Restated 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2014 Plan ).  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   29,529   shares remained available for issuance under the ESPP and   322,933   shares remained available for issuance under the 2014 Plan.  
    
  Exercises and vestings under our stock-based compensation plans resulted in   $0   and   $37,000   in income tax-related charges to additional paid-in capital during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively with   $(7,000)   and   $68,000   in such benefits or charges for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Unit Awards 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we granted   321,601   and   106,334   shares of restricted stock (net of any forfeitures), respectively, with aggregate grant date fair values of   $1.0 million   and   $0.3 million  , respectively. We incurred expenses of   $1.0 million   and   $0.7 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, related to restricted stock, restricted stock unit and stock option awards. When we grant restricted stock, we defer the grant date value of the restricted stock and amortize that value (net of the value of anticipated forfeitures) as compensation expense with an offsetting entry to the additional paid-in capital component of our consolidated shareholders  equity. Our restricted stock awards typically vest over a range of   12   to   60 months   (or other term as specified in the grant) and is amortized to salaries and benefits expense ratably over applicable vesting periods. As of   September 30, 2016  , our unamortized deferred compensation costs associated with non-vested restricted stock awards were   $0.7 million   with a weighted-average remaining amortization period of   1.0 year  .

ITEM 2. 
    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included therein and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, where certain terms (including trust, subsidiary and other entity names and financial, operating and statistical measures) have been defined. 
    
  This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes forward-looking statements. We base these forward-looking statements on our current plans, expectations and beliefs about future events. There are risks, including the factors discussed in  Risk Factors  in Part II, Item 1A and elsewhere in this Report, that our actual experience will differ materially from these expectations.  For more information, see "Forward-Looking Information" below.   
    
  In this Report, except as the context suggests otherwise, the words  Company,   Atlanticus Holdings Corporation,   Atlanticus,   we,   our,   ours  and  us  refer to Atlanticus Holdings Corporation and its subsidiaries and predecessors. 

OVERVIEW 
    
  We utilize proprietary analytics and a flexible technology platform to enable financial institutions to provide various credit and related financial services and products to or associated with the financially underserved consumer credit market.  Currently, within our Credit and Other Investments segment, we are applying the experiences gained and infrastructure built from servicing over $25 billion in consumer loans over our   20  -year operating history to support lenders who originate a range of consumer loan products under the brand, Fortiva.  These products include retail credit, personal loans and credit cards marketed through multiple channels, including retail point-of-sale, direct mail solicitation, Internet-based marketing and partnerships with third parties.   In the point-of-sale channel, we partner with retailers and service providers in various industries across the U.S. to allow them to provide credit to their customers for the purchase of a variety of goods and services including consumer electronics, furniture, elective medical procedures, educational services and home-improvements. Our flexible technology platform allows our lending partners to integrate our paperless process and instant decision-making platform with the technology infrastructure of participating retailers and service providers.  These services of our lending partners are often extended to consumers who may have been declined under traditional financing options.  We specialize in supporting this "second-look" credit service.  Additionally, we support lenders who market general purpose personal loans and credit cards directly to consumers through additional channels, which enables them to reach consumers through a diverse origination platform that includes direct mail, Internet-based marketing and our retail partnerships.  Our technology platform and proprietary analytics enable lenders to make instant credit decisions utilizing hundreds of inputs, from multiple sources and thereby offer credit to consumers overlooked by traditional providers of credit.  By offering a range of products through a multitude of channels, we enable lenders to provide the right type of credit, whenever and wherever the consumer has a need.  In most cases, we invest in the receivables originated by lenders who utilize our technology platform and other related services.   
    
  Using our infrastructure and technology platform, we also provide loan servicing, including risk management and customer service outsourcing, for third parties. Also through our Credit and Other Investments segment, we engage in testing and limited investment in consumer finance technology platforms as we seek to capitalize on our expertise and infrastructure.   
    
  Beyond these activities within our Credit and Other Investments segment, we invest in and service portfolios of credit card receivables.  One of our portfolios of credit card receivables is encumbered by non-recourse structured financing, and for this portfolio our principal remaining economic interest is the servicing compensation we receive as an offset against our servicing costs given that the likely future collections on the portfolio are insufficient to allow for full repayment of the financing.   
  Additionally, we report within our Credit and Other Investments segment the income earned from an investment in an equity-method investee that holds credit card receivables for which we are the servicer.  
    
  Lastly, we report within our Credit and Other Investments segment gains associated with investments previously made in consumer finance technology platforms.  These include investments in companies engaged in mobile technologies, marketplace lending and other financial technologies.  These investments are carried at the lower of cost or market valuation.  Some of these investees have raised, and continue to seek, capital at valuations in excess of our associated book value.  However, none of these companies are publicly-traded, there are no pending liquidity events, and ascribing value to these investments at this time would be speculative.

     Table of Contents  

The recurring cash flows we receive within our Credit and Other Investments segment principally include those associated with (1) point-of-sale and direct-to-consumer receivables, (2) servicing compensation and (3) credit card receivables portfolios that are unencumbered or where we own a portion of the underlying structured financing facility. 
    
  We historically financed most of the credit card receivables originated through our platform through the asset-backed securitization markets. These markets deteriorated significantly in 2008, and the level of  advance rates,  or leverage against credit card receivable assets, in the current asset-backed securitization markets is below pre-2008 levels. We do believe, however, that point-of-sale and direct-to-consumer receivables are generating, and will continue to generate, attractive returns on assets, thereby facilitating debt financing under terms and conditions (including advance rates and pricing) that will support attractive returns on equity, and we continue to pursue growth in this area. 
    
  Within our Auto Finance segment, our CAR subsidiary operations principally purchase and/or service loans secured by automobiles from or for, and also provide floor plan financing for, a pre-qualified network of independent automotive dealers and automotive finance companies in the buy-here, pay-here, used car business.  We purchase auto loans at a discount and with dealer retentions or holdbacks that provide risk protection. Also within our Auto Finance segment, we are providing certain installment lending products in addition to our traditional loans secured by automobiles. 
    
  Subject to the availability of capital at attractive terms and pricing, we plan to continue to evaluate and pursue a variety of activities, including:  (1) investments in additional financial assets associated with point-of-sale finance activities as well as the acquisition of interests in receivables portfolios; (2) investments in other assets or businesses that are not necessarily financial services assets or businesses; (3) the repurchase of our convertible senior notes and other debt or our outstanding common stock; and (4) the servicing of receivables and related financial assets for third parties.

  Total interest income.   Total interest income consists primarily of finance charges and late fees earned on point-of-sale and direct-to-consumer receivables, credit card and auto finance receivables. Period-over-period results reflect continued growth in our auto finance receivables, but primarily relate to growth in point-of-sale finance and direct-to-consumer products, the receivables of which increased from   $95.6 million   as of   September 30, 2015   to   $187.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .  These increases were offset, however, by continued net liquidations of our historical credit card receivable portfolios over the past year.  We are currently experiencing continued growth in point-of-sale and direct-to-consumer receivables and our CAR receivables growth which we expect to result in net period over period growth in our total interest income for these operations over the next few quarters.  Future periods' growth is also dependent on the addition of new retail partners to expand the reach of point-of-sale operations as well as continued growth within existing partnerships and continued growth within the direct-to-consumer receivables.  Despite anticipated increases in point-of-sale and direct-to-consumer receivables, continued net liquidations of our historic credit card receivables will continue to offset some of the expected increases and could result in overall net declines in interest income period over period if our investments in new receivable originations decline.

Interest expense.   Variations in interest expense are due to our debt facilities being repaid commensurate with net liquidations of the underlying credit card, auto finance and installment loan receivables that serve as collateral for the facilities offset by new borrowings associated with growth in point-of-sale and direct-to-consumer receivables and CAR operations as evidenced within Note 7,  Notes Payable,  to our consolidated financial statements.  We anticipate additional debt financing over the next few quarters as we continue to grow, and as such, we expect our quarterly interest expense to be above that experienced in the prior periods for these operations.  
    
  Fees and related income on earning assets.    The significant factors affecting our differing levels of fees and related income on earning assets include: 

declines in rental revenue as we significantly reduced rent-to-own originations in the fourth quarter of 2015 and for which we have discontinued new originations in 2016.  We expect continued reductions in revenues associated with this product offering as existing rent-to-own contracts culminate with no new originations expected; 
                
    reductions in fees on receivables, associated with general net declines in credit card receivables; and 
                
    the effects of changes in the fair values of credit card receivables recorded at fair value and notes payable associated with structured financings recorded at fair value as described below. 
       
  We expect a diminishing level of fee income for 2016 given expected future net liquidations of our credit card receivables.  Additionally, for credit card accounts for which we use fair value accounting, we expect our change in fair value of credit card receivables recorded at fair value and our change in fair value of notes payable associated with structured financings recorded at fair value amounts to gradually diminish (absent significant changes in the assumptions used to determine these fair values) in the future. These amounts, however, are subject to potentially high levels of volatility if we experience changes in the quality of our credit card receivables or if there are significant changes in market valuation factors (e.g., interest rates and spreads) in the future. Such volatility will be muted somewhat, however, by the offsetting nature of the receivables and underlying debt being recorded at fair value and with the expected reductions in the face amounts of such outstanding receivables and debt as we experience further credit card receivables liquidations and associated debt amortizing repayments.  Further, as discussed above, significant declines are expected in our rental revenue as existing rent-to-own contracts culminate with no new originations expected.  Offsetting declines in fees on credit products, is the aforementioned growth we are currently experiencing associated with point-of-sale, direct-to-consumer finance and credit card receivables and which we expect to continue through the remainder of 2016. 
    
  Servicing income.    We earn servicing income by servicing loan portfolios for third parties (including our equity-method investee).  Unless and/or until we grow the number of contractual servicing relationships we have with third parties or our current relationships grow their loan portfolios, we will not experience significant growth and income within this category, and we currently expect to experience limited to no growth in this category of revenue relative to revenue earned in prior periods. 
    
  Other income  .  Historically included within our other income category are ancillary and interchange revenues, which are now relatively insignificant for us due to credit card account closures and net credit card receivables portfolio liquidations. Absent portfolio acquisitions or continued growth with new credit card offerings and related receivables, we do not expect significant ancillary and interchange revenues in the future. Also included within our other income category are certain reimbursements we receive in respect of one of our portfolios.  
    
  Gain on repurchase of convertible senior notes.    In June 2016 we repurchased   $4.5 million   aggregate principal amount of outstanding   5.875%   convertible senior notes for   $2.0 million   plus accrued interest from unrelated third parties.  The purchase resulted in a gain of   $1.0 million   (net of the notes' applicable share of deferred costs, which were written off in connection with the repurchases).  Upon acquisition, the notes were retired. 
    
  Equity in income of equity-method investee.    Because our equity-method investee uses the fair value option to account for its financial assets and liabilities, changes in fair value estimates can cause some volatility in the earnings of this investee. Because of continued liquidations in the credit card receivables portfolio of our equity-method investee, absent additional investments in our existing or in new equity-method investees in the future, we expect gradually declining effects from our equity-method investment on our operating results.  
    
  Net recovery of losses upon charge off of loans and fees receivable recorded at fair value.   This account reflects charge offs (net of recoveries) of the face amount of credit card receivables we record at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet. We have experienced a general trending decline in, and we expect future trending declines in, these charge offs as we continue to liquidate our historical credit card receivables.  Additionally, net recovery in both periods reflects the effects of reimbursements received in respect of one of our portfolios.  In the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015,  
  
   30 

     Table of Contents  

these reimbursements exceeded the charge-offs experienced within the portfolio as the reimbursements are not directly associated with the timing of actual charge offs.  In conjunction with this, increased accrued liabilities associated with required reimbursements to consumers caused a significant reduction in the recognition of these reimbursements during the third quarter relative to prior periods.  The timing of these reimbursements cannot be reliably determined and as such we may not continue to experience similar positive impacts on future quarters.  
    
  Provision for losses on loans and fees receivable recorded at net realizable value.    Our provision for losses on loans and fees receivable recorded at net realizable value covers, with respect to such receivables, changes in estimates regarding our aggregate loss exposures on (1) principal receivable balances, (2) finance charges and late fees receivable underlying income amounts included within our total interest income category, and (3) other fees receivable. We have experienced a period-over-period increase in this category between the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015 due to the previously mentioned growth associated with our receivables.  This increase primarily reflects the effects of volume associated with point-of-sale, direct-to-consumer and credit card finance receivables (i.e., growth of new product receivables and their subsequent maturation), rather than specific credit quality changes or deterioration. See Note 2,  Significant Accounting Policies and Consolidated Financial Statement Components,  to our consolidated financial statements and the discussions of our Credit and Other Investments and Auto Finance segments for further credit quality statistics and analysis. 
    
  Total other operating expense.   Total other operating expense variances for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , relative to the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , reflect the following: 

reductions in card and loan servicing expenses in the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   when compared to the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   based on lower originations for our rent-to-own products as well as continued net liquidations in our credit card portfolios, the receivables of which declined from   $59.3 million   outstanding to   $38.0 million   outstanding at   September 30, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  These declines have been offset by expenses related to growth in point-of-sale and direct-to-consumer products, the receivables of which grew from   $95.6 million   outstanding to   $187.0 million   outstanding at   September 30, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  , respectively; 
                
    decreases in depreciation primarily associated with declines in originations under our rent-to-own program which declined to   $0.5 million   and   $5.2 million   from   $9.9 million   and    $31.5 million   for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively; and 
                
    decreases in other expenses due to the reversal of a    3.4 million   (  $5.0 million  ) reserve in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  This reserve related to a review in the U.K. by HM Revenue and Customs ("HMRC") associated with filings by one of our U.K. subsidiaries to reclaim VAT that it paid on its inputs and that it believed were and are eligible to be reclaimed.  In February of 2016, we received correspondence from HMRC stating that it (1) had chosen to discontinue its review of our U.K. subsidiary s VAT filings with no changes to the returns as filed by our U.K. subsidiary, and (2) would be refunding VAT refund claims made by our U.K. subsidiary that had been suspended during the HMRC review.  We subsequently received substantially all of such refunds, and as such we reversed the    3.4 million   (  $5.0 million  ) of VAT review-related liabilities in the first quarter of 2016. 
       
  Offsetting these declines are: 

increases in salaries and benefit costs for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   when compared to the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   resulting from growth in our new credit receivables and related activities; 
                
    increases in marketing costs for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as brand marketing expanded in late 2015 and in the first quarter of 2016.  Offsetting some of this increase are decreases in marketing costs as the point-of-sale and direct-to-consumer operations require less direct-to-consumer marketing expenses than traditional credit card operations.  We expect that increased origination and brand marketing support will result in overall increases in year over year costs for the remainder of 2016 although the frequency and timing of marketing efforts could result in reductions in quarter over quarter marketing costs as was experienced during the three months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015; and 
                
    general increases in other expenses including receivables acquisition, risk management costs and third party costs associated with ongoing information technology upgrades. 
       
  A portion of our operating costs are variable based on the levels of accounts and receivables we service (both for our own account and for others) and the pace and breadth of our search for, acquisition of and introduction of new business lines, products and services. However, a number of our operating costs are fixed and until recently have comprised a larger percentage of our total costs based on the ongoing contraction of our credit card receivable levels. This trend is gradually reversing, however, as we continue to grow our earning assets (including loans and fees receivable) based principally on  
  
   31 

     Table of Contents  

growth of point-of-sale receivables and to a lesser extent, growth within our CAR operations. We continue to perform extensive reviews of all areas of our businesses for cost savings opportunities to better align our costs with our portfolio of managed receivables. 
    
  Notwithstanding our cost-control efforts and focus, we expect increased levels of expenditures associated with growth in point-of-sale, direct-to-consumer and credit card product related operations.  While we have greater control over our variable expenses, it is difficult (as explained above) for us to appreciably reduce our fixed and other costs associated with an infrastructure (particularly within our Credit and Other Investments segment) that was built to support levels of managed receivables that are significantly higher than both our current levels and the levels that we expect to see in the near future. At this point, our Credit and Other Investments segment cash inflows are sufficient to cover its direct variable costs and a portion, but not all, of its share of overhead costs (including, for example, corporate-level executive and administrative costs and our convertible senior notes interest costs). As such, if we are unable to contain overhead costs or expand revenue-earning activities to levels commensurate with such costs, then, depending upon the earnings generated from our Auto Finance segment and our liquidating credit card portfolios, we may experience continuing pressure on our ability to achieve consistent profitability. 
    
  Noncontrolling interests.    We reflect the ownership interests of noncontrolling holders of equity in our majority-owned subsidiaries as noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of operations. Unless we enter into significant new majority-owned subsidiary ventures with noncontrolling interest holders in the future, we expect to have negligible noncontrolling interests in our majority-owned subsidiaries and negligible allocations of income or loss to noncontrolling interest holders in future quarters. 
    
  Income Taxes.   We experienced effective income tax benefit rates of   34.0%   and   47.3%   for the   three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to an effective income tax expense rate of   190.5%   and a negative effective income tax expense rate of    2.2%   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.  Our effective income tax benefit rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is below the statutory rate principally due to our accruals of interest and penalties on unpaid tax liabilities relative to our   $13.7 million   of pre-tax loss during this period.  Our effective income tax benefit rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is above the statutory rate principally due to the income of our U.K. subsidiary (1) that is not subject to tax in the U.S., and (2) the U.K. tax on which was fully offset by the release of U.K. valuation allowances.  Our negative effective income tax expense rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 differs significantly from the statutory rate principally as a result of (1) the release of prior year accruals for uncertain tax positions and interest thereon due to a favorable effective settlement with the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) that we reached in February 2015 with respect to our 2012 tax year and the expiration of the statute of limitations for our 2011 tax year, and (2) our reversal of a portion of the interest and penalty accruals on tax liability assessments associated with our 2007 and 2008 IRS audits. With the exception of the February 2015 effective settlement with the IRS, the above factors likewise contributed to our negative effective income tax expense rate for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
    
                  As noted above, we report potential accrued interest and penalties related to both our accrued liabilities for uncertain tax positions and unpaid tax liabilities within our income tax benefit or expense line item on our consolidated statements of operations. We likewise report the reversal of such accrued interest and penalties within the income tax benefit or expense line item to the extent that we resolve our liabilities for uncertain tax positions or unpaid tax liabilities in a manner favorable to our accruals therefor.  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , our income tax expense includes   $0.2 million   and   $0.6 million  , respectively, accrued for income tax-related interest and penalties.  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , our income tax expense included   $0.0 million   and   $0.7 million  , respectively, accrued for income tax-related interest and penalties. 
    
  In December 2014, we reached a settlement with the IRS concerning the tax treatment of net operating losses that we incurred in 2007 and 2008 and carried back to obtain refunds of federal income taxes paid in earlier years dating back to 2003. Our net unpaid income tax assessment associated with that settlement was   $7.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  ; this amount excludes unpaid interest and penalties on the tax assessment, the accruals for which aggregated   $3.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  . The IRS is currently examining amended return claims we have made, which, if ultimately approved by the IRS or the courts, would eliminate the   $7.3 million   assessment and cause the reversal of the   $3.3 million   accrual we have made for interest and penalties thereon.  We have been informed that the IRS intends to deny our amended return claims. Once we receive their formal disallowance, we plan to protest the disallowance with IRS Appeals, and in litigation should we not receive favorable resolution of the matter with IRS Appeals.  As is customary, the IRS has filed a lien in respect of their assessment. 
       
  Credit and Other Investments Segment 
       Our Credit and Other Investments segment includes our activities relating to our servicing of and our investments in the retail credit ("point-of-sale" operations), personal loan and credit card receivables (collectively our "direct-to-consumer"  
  
   32 

     Table of Contents  

operations) and our various credit card receivables portfolios, as well as other product testing and investments that generally utilize much of the same infrastructure.  The types of revenues we earn from our investments in receivables portfolios and services primarily include finance charges, fees and the accretion of discounts associated with the point-of-sale receivables.  
    
  We record (i) the finance charges, discount accretion and late fees assessed on our Credit and Other Investments segment receivables in the interest income - consumer loans, including past due fees category on our consolidated statements of operations, (ii) the rental revenue, over-limit, annual, activation, monthly maintenance, returned-check, cash advance and other fees in the fees and related income on earning assets category on our consolidated statements of operations, and (iii) the charge offs (and recoveries thereof) within our provision for losses on loans and fees receivable on our consolidated statements of operations (for all credit product receivables other than those for which we have elected the fair value option) and within losses upon charge off of loans and fees receivable recorded at fair value on our consolidated statements of operations (for all of our other receivables for which we have elected the fair value option). Additionally, we show the effects of fair value changes for those credit card receivables for which we have elected the fair value option as a component of fees and related income on earning assets in our consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  Depreciation expense associated with rental merchandise (totaling   $0.5 million  ,   $5.2 million  ,   $9.9 million   and   $31.5 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively) for which we receive rental revenue is included as a component of our overall depreciation in our consolidated statements of operations. We expect continued reductions in our depreciation of rental merchandise as existing rent-to-own contracts culminate with no new originations expected. 
    
  We historically have invested in receivables portfolios through subsidiary entities. If we control through direct ownership or exert a controlling interest in the entity, we consolidate it and reflect its operations as noted above. If we exert significant influence but do not control the entity, we record our share of its net operating results in the equity in income of equity-method investee category on our consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  Managed Receivables 
    
  We make various references within our discussion of the Credit and Other Investments segment to our managed receivables. In calculating managed receivables data, we include within managed receivables those receivables we manage for our consolidated subsidiaries, but we exclude from managed receivables any noncontrolling interest holders  shares of the receivables. Additionally, we include within managed receivables only our economic share of the receivables that we manage for our equity-method investee.  
    
  Financial, operating and statistical data based on aggregate managed receivables are important to any evaluation of the performance of our credit portfolios, including our risk management, servicing and collection activities and our valuing of purchased receivables.  In allocating our resources and managing our business, management relies heavily upon financial data and results prepared on this  managed basis.  Analysts, investors and others also consider it important that we provide selected financial, operating and statistical data on a managed basis because this allows a comparison of us to others within the specialty finance industry. Moreover, our management, analysts, investors and others believe it is critical that they understand the credit performance of the entire portfolio of our managed receivables because it reveals information concerning the quality of loan originations and the related credit risks inherent within the portfolios. 
    
  Reconciliation of the managed receivables data to our GAAP financial statements requires: (1) an understanding that our managed receivables data are based on billings and actual charge offs as they occur, without regard to any changes in our allowance for uncollectible loans and fees receivable or any changes in the fair value of loans and fees receivable and their associated structured financing notes; (2) inclusion of our economic share of (or equity interest in) the receivables we manage for our equity-method investee; (3) removal of any noncontrolling interest holders  shares of the managed receivables underlying our GAAP consolidated results; (4) treatment of the transaction in which our 50%-owned equity-method investee acquired our structured financing trust notes (a) as a deemed sale of the trust receivables at their face amount, (b) followed by the 50%-owned equity-method investee s deemed repurchase of such receivables for consideration equal to the discounted purchase price that it paid for the notes, and (c) as though the difference between the deemed face amount and the deemed discounted repurchase price of the receivables is to be treated as credit quality discount to be accreted into managed earnings as a reduction of net charge offs over the remaining life of the receivables; and (5) the exclusion from our managed receivables data of certain reimbursements received in respect of one of our portfolios which resulted in pre-tax income benefits within our total interest income, fees and related income on earning assets, losses upon charge off of loans and fees receivable recorded at fair value, net of recoveries, other income, servicing income, and equity in income of equity-method investee line items on our consolidated statements of operations totaling approximately $2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, $7.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, $5.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, $10.7 million for  
  
   33 

     Table of Contents  

the three months ended December 31, 2015, $11.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, $10.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015, $12.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015, and $8.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2014.  This last category of reconciling items above is excluded because it does not bear on our performance in managing our credit card portfolios, including our risk management, servicing and collection activities and our valuing of purchased receivables; moreover, it is difficult to determine the future effects of any such reimbursements that may be received. 
    
  We at times have invested in credit card receivables portfolios at substantial discounts. In our managed basis statistical data, we apply a portion of these discounts against receivables acquired for which charge off is considered likely, including accounts in late stages of delinquency at the date of acquisition; this portion is measured based on our acquisition date estimate of the shortfall of cash flows expected to be collected on the acquired portfolios relative to the face amount of receivables represented within the acquired portfolios. We refer to the balance of the discount for each purchase not needed for credit quality as accretable yield, which we accrete into total yield in our managed basis statistical data using the interest method over the estimated life of each acquired portfolio. As of the close of each financial reporting period, we evaluate the appropriateness of the credit quality discount component and the accretable yield component of our acquisition discount based on actual and projected future cash flows. 
    
  Asset quality.   Our delinquency and charge-off data at any point in time reflect the credit performance of our managed receivables. The average age of the accounts underlying our receivables, the timing of portfolio purchases, the success of our collection and recovery efforts and general economic conditions all affect our delinquency and charge-off rates. The average age of the accounts underlying our receivables portfolio also affects the stability of our delinquency and loss rates. We consider this delinquency and charge-off data in our determination of the fair value of our credit card receivables underlying formerly off-balance-sheet securitization structures, as well as our allowance for uncollectible loans and fees receivable in the case of our other credit product receivables that we report at net realizable value. Our strategy for managing delinquency and receivables losses consists of account management throughout the customer relationship. This strategy includes credit line management and pricing based on the risks. See also our discussion of collection strategies under the  How Do We Collect from Our Customers?  in Item 1,  Business  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
    
  The following table presents the delinquency trends of the receivables we manage within our Credit and Other Investments segment, as well as charge-off data and other managed receivables statistics (in thousands; percentages of total):

     Table of Contents  

Managed receivables levels.     The quarterly decline in our period-end and average managed receivables between the fourth quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015 reflects the net liquidating state of our historical credit card receivables portfolios given the closure of substantially all credit card accounts underlying the portfolios.  Nevertheless, because of the receivables growth we have experienced and expect to continue to experience over the coming quarters associated with the current product offerings, we experienced overall quarterly growth throughout 2015 and 2016.  Managed receivables declines in the fourth quarter of 2014 were exaggerated by our distribution of certain assets to an unrelated third-party partner in a joint venture for its interest.  Growth in future periods largely is dependent on the addition of new retail partners to the point-of-sale operations as well as the timing of solicitations within the direct-to-consumer operations.  Based on this, we expect managed receivables levels to continue to grow modestly from current levels for the remainder of 2016 and into 2017.  
    
  Delinquencies.   Delinquencies have the potential to impact net income in the form of net credit losses. Delinquencies also are costly in terms of the personnel and resources dedicated to resolving them. We intend for the receivables management strategies we use on our portfolios to manage and, to the extent possible, reduce the higher delinquency rates that can be expected in the more mature portion of our managed portfolio. These account management strategies include conservative credit line management, purging of inactive accounts and collection strategies intended to optimize the effective account-to-collector ratio across delinquency categories. We measure the success of these efforts by measuring delinquency rates. These rates exclude receivables that have been charged off. 
    
  Given that the vast majority of credit card accounts related to our historical credit card receivables have been closed and there has been no significant new activity for these accounts, we generally have noted declines in delinquency statistics of our managed credit card receivables (when compared to the same quarters in prior period). Additionally, our historical credit card originations in the U.K. experienced higher than average delinquency rates.  As these U.K. credit card receivables have substantially liquidated, the associated higher delinquencies no longer have a significant negative impact on our overall delinquency rates.  
    
  We expect our investment in the point-of-sale and direct-to-consumer receivables to become a larger component of our managed receivables base, given the acceleration of growth in these products.  Further, we expect our delinquency rates to increase slightly (when compared to periods during which credit cards made up a larger portion of our managed receivables) as the risk profiles (and thus expected returns) for these receivables are higher than that experienced under our mature credit card receivables underlying closed credit card accounts.  Given that our early investments in receivables are reaching peak charge off periods, our delinquency rates in the third quarter of 2016 were slightly higher than those experienced in the third quarter of 2015.  In recent quarters our delinquency rates were lower than prior quarters because our new point-of-sale and direct-to-consumer receivables had not yet reached peak charge off periods.  If and when growth for these product lines moderates, we expect increased overall delinquency rates as the existing receivables mature through their peak charge-off periods.  Additionally, seasonal payment patterns on these receivables are similar to those experienced with our historical credit card originations and we expect those patterns to continue. For example, delinquency rates historically are lower in the first quarter of each year as seen above due to the benefits of seasonally strong payment patterns associated with year-end tax refunds for most consumers.   
    
  Total yield ratio  .    As noted previously, the mix of our managed receivables has shifted away from certain higher-yielding credit card receivables. Those particular originated receivables traditionally had higher delinquency rates and late and over-limit fee assessments than do our other portfolios, and thus have higher total yield ratios as well.  Additionally, our total yield ratio has been adversely affected in past quarters by our Non-U.S. Acquired Portfolio acquisition. Its total yields are below average compared to our other portfolios although the impacts of this portfolio are declining as its receivables continue to liquidate and are relatively immaterial at this time. 
    
  Offsetting the historical impacts noted above is growth in our newer, higher yielding receivables, including point-of-sale receivables. While this growth has contributed to increases in our total yield ratio, we expect this growth will slow or even modestly reverse the trend of our declining charge-off rates as discussed above because we expect these receivables to season, mature, and charge off at higher rates than we currently experience on our liquidating pool of credit card receivables associated with closed credit card accounts.  We anticipate continued growth in our higher yielding point-of-sale receivables over the next few quarters which should continue to stabilize our yield consistent with what we experienced in the past several quarters.  However, the timing of originations as well as the relative mix of receivables originated within a given quarter may contribute to some continued minor variability in our total yield ratio. 
    
  Although we have seen generally improving total yield ratio trend-lines, our fourth quarter 2014 total yield ratio was also positively impacted by the decline in the managed receivables base discussed above as well as recoveries on investments in securities in excess of their carrying value and our repurchase of convertible senior notes.  Similarly, our third quarter 2015 total yield ratio was positively impacted by the recovery of approximately $2.0 million associated with a receivable that was  
  
   35 

     Table of Contents  

fully reserved in a prior period.  Absent these items, our total yield ratio would have been 35.8% and 35.6% in the third quarter of 2015 and the fourth quarter of 2014, respectively.  
    
  Combined gross charge-off ratio and Adjusted charge-off ratio.   We charge off our Credit and Other Investments segment receivables when they become contractually more than 180 days past due or 120 days past due for the point-of-sale and direct-to-consumer receivables. We charge off rent-to-own receivables and impair associated rental merchandise if the customer has not made a payment within the previous 90 days. However, if a customer makes a payment greater than or equal to two minimum payments within a month of the charge-off date, we may reconsider whether charge-off status remains appropriate. Typically, we charge off receivables within 30 days of notification and confirmation of a consumer s bankruptcy or death. However, in some cases of death, we do not charge off receivables if there is a surviving, contractually liable individual or an estate large enough to pay the debt in full. 
    
  Certain of our previously acquired credit card receivables have higher charge offs relative to their average managed receivables balances, than do our other portfolios. Due to the recent higher rate of decline in these particular receivables relative to all of our other outstanding credit card receivables, as well as the longer weighted average age and maturity of our remaining managed receivables portfolio, all things being equal, one would expect reduced charge-off ratios for these receivables.  However, this trend has been muted to some degree simply due to a change in the mix of our receivable balances due to growth within point-of-sale finance and direct-to-consumer receivables that have higher charge-off rates than the liquidating credit card portfolios as well as increased charge-offs associated with credit card receivables originated in the U.K.  The declines we experienced in the second quarter of 2015 and 2016 in both our combined and adjusted gross charge-off ratios were largely due to the seasonal beneficial impacts associated with customer payments experienced in the first quarter of each of those years.  Additionally, negatively impacting the charge-off ratios in the first quarter of 2015 (and thus magnifying the decline in charge-off ratios noted in the second quarter) were higher than anticipated charge-offs associated with one of the retail channels we support.  Our recent combined gross charge-off and adjusted charge-off ratios benefited from growth we experienced in point-of-sale and direct-to-consumer receivables during 2016 which have not yet reached peak charge off periods. 
    
  The continued growth in the point-of-sale and direct-to-consumer receivables continues to result in higher charge-offs than those experienced historically.  In the next few quarters, we expect increasing charge off rates on a period-over-period comparison basis. This expectation is based on (1) the age, maturity and stability of our portfolio of generally liquidating receivables associated with closed credit card accounts, (2) higher expected charge off rates on the point-of-sale and direct-to-consumer receivables, offset by lower charge offs associated with historical credit card receivables originated in the U.K. due to the continued liquidation of these receivables, (3) the low charge-off ratios experienced in the second quarter of 2015 and 2016 as discussed above and (4) recent vintages reaching peak charge-off periods.  Offsetting these increases will be growth in the underlying receivables base which will serve to mute some of the aforementioned impacts as has been seen in recent quarters. 
    
  Auto Finance Segment 
    
  Our Auto Finance segment historically included a variety of auto sales and lending activities. 
    
  Our original platform, CAR, acquired in April 2005, principally purchases and/or services loans secured by automobiles from or for, and also provides floor-plan financing for, a pre-qualified network of independent automotive dealers and automotive finance companies in the buy-here, pay-here used car business.  We have expanded these operations to also include certain installment lending products in addition to our traditional loans secured by automobiles.   
    
  Collectively, as of   September 30, 2016  , we served more than   570   dealers through our Auto Finance segment in   33   states, the District of Columbia and two U.S. territories. 
    
  Managed Receivables Background 
    
  For reasons set forth above within our Credit and Other Investments segment discussion, we also provide managed receivables-based financial, operating and statistical data for our Auto Finance segment. Reconciliation of the auto finance managed receivables data to our GAAP financial statements requires an understanding that our managed receivables data are based on billings and actual charge offs as they occur, without regard to any changes in our allowance for uncollectible loans and fees receivable.

Analysis of Statistical Data 
    
  Financial, operating and statistical metrics for our Auto Finance segment are detailed (in thousands; percentages of total) in the following table: 

Managed receivables.    We are beginning to see and expect stability in the level of our managed receivables, with growth through receivable purchase/origination opportunities in the U.S. and U.S. territories.  Although we are expanding our CAR operations, the Auto Finance segment faces strong competition from other specialty finance lenders, as well as the indirect effects on us of our buy-here, pay-here dealership customers' competition with more traditional franchise dealerships for consumers interested in purchasing automobiles.  We expect managed receivable levels to continue to grow slightly from current levels during the remainder of 2016 and into 2017 as we continue to expand our operations in the U.S. and U.S. territories.  
    
  Delinquencies.    Current delinquency levels we are experiencing represent what we would expect going forward with some marginal increases noted within the overall buy-here pay-here market.  Delinquency rates historically are lower in the first quarter of each year as seen above due to the benefits of seasonally strong payment patterns associated with year-end tax refunds for most consumers.   Second quarter 2016 delinquency rates were positively impacted by higher than anticipated customer payments experienced in the first quarter of 2016.  We are not concerned with modest fluctuations in delinquency rates and do not believe they will have a significantly positive or adverse impact on our results of operations; even at slightly elevated rates, we earn significant yields on CAR s receivables and have significant dealer reserves (i.e., retainages or holdbacks on the amount of funding CAR provides to its dealer customers) to protect against meaningful credit losses.  
    
  Total yield ratio.    We have experienced modest fluctuations in our total yield ratio largely impacted by the relative mix of receivables in our various products offered by CAR as some shorter term product offerings tend to have higher yields. Slightly depressing the overall total yield ratio in the first and second quarters of 2016 is the growth we experienced in the average managed receivables levels which negatively impacted the ratio ahead of the positive impacts of associated billed yield on this growth. As we experienced slight declines in our managed receivables levels in the third quarter of 2016 we realized this delayed impact.   Yields on our CAR products over the last few quarters are consistent with our expectations and we expect our total yield ratio to remain in line with current experience with moderate fluctuations based on relative growth or declines in average managed receivables for a given quarter as noted above.  Excluded from our total yield ratio in the third quarter of 2015 is the resolution of an outstanding dispute that resulted in the recovery of approximately $2.0 million associated with a receivable that was fully reserved in a prior period. 
    
  Combined gross charge-off ratio and recovery ratio.    We charge off auto finance receivables when they are between 120 and 180 days past due, unless the collateral is repossessed and sold before that point, in which case we will record a charge off when the proceeds are received.  The rise in our combined gross charge-off ratio in the fourth quarter of 2014 was due to specific dealer related losses that accounted for substantially all of the increase for the quarter, offset slightly by better than anticipated recoveries.  Similarly, in the fourth quarter of 2015 we experienced specific dealer related losses that increased our charge-off ratio for that quarter.  Combined gross charge-off ratios in 2016 reflect the lower delinquency rates we have  
  
   37 

     Table of Contents  

experienced thus far in 2016 relative to the same periods in 2015.  While we anticipate our charge-offs to be incurred ratably across our portfolio of dealers, specific dealer related losses are difficult to predict and can negatively influence our combined gross charge-off ratio as was seen in the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2015.  We continually re-assess our dealers and will take appropriate action if we believe a particular dealer's risk characteristics adversely change.   Significantly all charge offs we experienced in the first and second quarters of 2015 were offset by available dealer reserves resulting in lower charge-off ratios for those periods.  While we have appropriate dealer reserves to mitigate losses across the majority of our pool of receivables, the timing of recognition of these reserves as an offset to charge offs is largely dependent on various factors specific to each of our dealer partners including ongoing purchase volumes, outstanding balances of receivables and current performance of outstanding loans.  As such, the timing of charge off offsets is difficult to predict, however we believe that these reserves are adequate to offset any loss exposure we may incur.  Additionally, the products we issue in the U.S. territories do not have dealer reserves with which we can offset losses.  As our investments in these loans grow, we expect that gross charge-off rates will climb slightly over existing rates.  We also expect our recovery rate to fluctuate modestly from quarter to quarter due to the timing of the sale of repossessed autos. 
    
  Definitions of Financial, Operating and Statistical Measures  
  Total yield ratio.     Represents an annualized fraction, the numerator of which includes all finance charge and late fee income billed on all outstanding receivables, plus credit card fees (including over-limit fees, cash advance fees, returned check fees and interchange income), plus earned, amortized amounts of annual membership fees and activation fees with respect to certain of credit card receivables, plus ancillary income, plus amortization of the accretable yield component of our acquisition discounts for portfolio purchases, plus gains (or less losses) on debt repurchases and other activities within our Credit and Other Investments segment less any adjustments to finance and fee billings, and the denominator of which is average managed receivables.  
  Combined gross charge-off ratio.     Represents an annualized fraction the numerator of which is the aggregate amounts of finance charge, fee and principal losses from consumers unwilling or unable to pay their receivables balances, as well as from bankrupt and deceased consumers, less current-period recoveries (including recoveries from dealer reserve offsets for our CAR operations), and the denominator of which is average managed receivables. Recoveries on managed receivables represent all amounts received related to managed receivables that previously have been charged off, including payments received directly from consumers and proceeds received from the sale of those charged-off receivables. Recoveries typically have represented less than 2% of average managed receivables. 
  Adjusted charge-off ratio.    Represents an annualized fraction the numerator of which is the principal amount of losses, net of recoveries as adjusted to apply discount accretion related to the credit quality of acquired portfolios to offset a portion of the actual face amount of net charge offs, and the denominator of which is average managed receivables. (Historically, upon our acquisitions of credit card receivables, a portion of the discount reflected within our acquisition prices has related to the credit quality of the acquired receivables that portion representing the excess of the face amount of the receivables acquired over the future cash flows expected to be collected from the receivables. Because we treat the credit quality discount component of our acquisition discount as related exclusively to acquired principal balances, the difference between our net charge offs and our adjusted charge offs for each respective reporting period represents the total dollar amount of our charge offs that were charged against our credit quality discount during each respective reporting period.) 
     
  LIQUIDITY, FUNDING AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  As discussed elsewhere in this Report, we incur a significant level of costs associated with a fixed infrastructure that had been designed to support our significant legacy credit card operations. Our infrastructure costs are still somewhat elevated, and while we had in the past been focused on cost reduction, our primary focus now is on growing the point-of-sale, direct-to-consumer and credit card receivables so that our revenues from these investments can cover our infrastructure costs and return us to consistent profitability. Increases in new and existing retail partnerships have resulted in quarterly growth of total managed receivables levels subsequent to the end of 2014, and we expect this growth to continue in the coming quarters.   
    
  Accordingly, we will continue to focus in the coming quarters on (i) containing costs (as opposed to our previous focus on reducing expenses) (ii) obtaining new retail partners to continue growth of the point-of-sale receivables (iii) continuing growth in direct-to-consumer and credit card receivables and (iv) obtaining the funding necessary to meet capital needs required by the growth of our receivables and to cover our infrastructure costs until our receivables investments generate enough revenues and cash flows to cover such costs.

All of our Credit and Other Investments segment s structured financing facilities are expected to amortize down with collections on the receivables within their underlying trusts and should not represent significant refunding or refinancing risks to our consolidated balance sheet.  Additionally, we do not expect any imminent refunding or financing needs associated with our 5.875% convertible senior notes given their maturity in 2035. In May 2015 we redeemed the remainder of the outstanding   3.625%   convertible senior notes.  As such, the only facilities that could represent significant refunding or refinancing needs as of   September 30, 2016   are those associated with the following notes payable in the amounts indicated (in millions):  
                     Revolving credit facility (expiring October 29, 2017) that is secured by certain receivables and restricted cash 
    $ 
    34.7 
      
      Revolving credit facility (expiring October 4, 2017) that is secured by the financial and operating assets of our CAR operations 
    25.2 
      
      Senior secured term loan from related parties (expiring November 22, 2016) that is secured by certain assets of the Company with an annual interest rate equal to 9.0% 
    40.0 
      
           Total 
    $ 
    99.9 

Further details concerning the above debt facilities are provided in Note 7,  Notes Payable,  and Note 8,  Convertible Senior Notes,  to our consolidated financial statements included herein. Based on the state of the debt capital markets, the performance of our assets that serve as security for the above facilities, and our relationships with lenders, we view imminent refunding or refinancing risks with respect to the above facilities as low in the current environment, and we believe that the quality of our new receivables should allow us to raise more capital through increasing the size of our facilities with our existing lenders and attracting new lending relationships. With respect to our senior secured term loan expiring November 22, 2016, we are in discussions with the lending party and anticipate that the loan will be extended on similar terms prior to expiration. 
    
  In October 2016, the revolving credit facility underlying our CAR operations was repaid.  In connection with this repayment we entered into a new revolving credit facility that provides for $40.0 million in available financing which can be drawn to the extent of outstanding eligible principal receivables within the borrower entities  operations and accrues interest at an annual rate equal to LIBOR plus the applicable margin, ranging from 2.4% to 3.0% based on the ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth.  The new facility matures November 1, 2018.  The facility is subject to certain affirmative covenants, including a coverage ratio and a leverage ratio, the failure of which could result in required early repayment of all or a portion of the outstanding balance.  The facility is secured by the general financial and operating assets of our CAR operations. 
    
  In December 2014, we reached a settlement with the IRS concerning the tax treatment of net operating losses that we incurred in 2007 and 2008 and carried back to obtain refunds of federal income taxes paid in earlier years dating back to 2003. Our net unpaid income tax assessment associated with that settlement was   $7.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  ; this amount excludes unpaid interest and penalties on the tax assessment, the accruals for which aggregated   $3.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  . The IRS is currently examining amended return claims we have made, which, if ultimately approved by the IRS or the courts, would eliminate the   $7.3 million   assessment and cause the reversal of the   $3.3 million   accrual we have made for interest and penalties thereon. While we have been informed that the IRS intends to deny our amended return claims, we have not received their formal disallowance yet, and assuming that we do receive their formal disallowance, we plan to protest the disallowance with IRS Appeals, and in litigation should we not receive favorable resolution of the matter with IRS Appeals.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $58.7 million   in unrestricted cash held by our various business subsidiaries. Because the characteristics of our assets and liabilities change, liquidity management has been a dynamic process for us, driven by the pricing and maturity of our assets and liabilities. We historically have financed our business through cash flows from operations, asset-backed structured financings and the issuance of debt and equity. Details concerning our cash flows for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   are as follows: 

During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we   generated     $24.7 million   of cash flows from operations compared to the   use of     $7.2 million   of cash flows from operations during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in cash provided by operating activities was principally related to 1) reductions in purchases of rental merchandise associated with point-of-sale finance operations, 2) cost reductions associated with card and loan servicing, 3) collections associated with reimbursements received in respect of one of our portfolios, and 4) the timing of payment associated with accrued liabilities including those associated with a portion of the reimbursements received in respect of one of our portfolios that are ultimately payable to customers.  These increases in cash provided by operating activities were offset by decreases in collections associated with our credit card finance charge receivables in the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   relative to the same period in 2015, given diminished receivables levels. 
     
   39 

     Table of Contents  

During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we   used     $56.6 million   of cash from our investing activities, compared to   generating     $12.0 million   of cash from investing activities during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  This decrease is primarily due to increasing levels of investments in the point-of-sale and direct-to-consumer receivables relative to the same period in 2015 and the shrinking size of our liquidating credit card receivables and corresponding payments from consumers.  Offsetting these declines are the subsequent cash returns on our increasing investments in point-of-sale and direct to consumer receivables as well as reductions in our restricted cash levels, both of which contributed positively to our cash generated from investing activities.  
                
    During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we   generated     $40.8 million   of cash in financing activities, compared to our   use of     $5.9 million   of cash in financing activities during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  In both periods, the data reflect net repayments of debt facilities corresponding with net declines in our loans and fees receivable that serve as the underlying collateral for the facilities (principally credit card and auto loans and fees receivable). Offsetting our use of cash in financing activities for both periods are borrowings associated with point-of-sale and direct-to-consumer receivables, net of repayments on those facilities. 
       
  Beyond our immediate financing efforts discussed throughout this Report, we will continue to evaluate debt and equity issuances as a means to fund our investment opportunities. We expect to take advantage of any opportunities to raise additional capital if terms and pricing are attractive to us. Any proceeds raised under these efforts or additional liquidity available to us could be used to fund (1) the acquisition of additional financial assets associated with the point-of-sale, direct-to-consumer finance and credit card operations as well as the acquisition of credit card receivables portfolios, (2) further repurchases of our 5.875% convertible senior notes and common stock, and (3) investments in certain financial and non-financial assets or businesses. Pursuant to a share repurchase plan authorized by our Board of Directors on May 12, 2016, we are authorized as of   September 30, 2016   to repurchase an additional   4,912,401   shares of our common stock through June 30, 2018. 
    
  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
    
  See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
    
  Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  We do not currently have any off-balance-sheet arrangements; however, we do have certain contractual arrangements that would require us to make payments or provide funding if certain circumstances occur, which we refer to as contingent commitments. We do not currently expect that these contingent commitments will result in any material amounts being paid by us. See Note 9,  Commitments and Contingencies,  to our consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion of these matters. 
    
  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
  See Note 2,  Significant Accounting Policies and Consolidated Financial Statement Components,  to our consolidated financial statements included herein for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. 
    
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  
    
  We have prepared our financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These principles are numerous and complex. We have summarized our significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. In many instances, the application of GAAP requires management to make estimates or to apply subjective principles to particular facts and circumstances. A variance in the estimates used or a variance in the application or interpretation of GAAP could yield a materially different accounting result. It is impracticable for us to summarize every accounting principle that requires us to use judgment or estimates in our application. Nevertheless, we describe below the areas for which we believe that the estimations, judgments or interpretations that we have made, if different, would have yielded the most significant differences in our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  On a quarterly basis, we review our significant accounting policies and the related assumptions, in particular, those mentioned below, with the audit committee of the Board of Directors. 
    
  Measurements for Loans and Fees Receivable at Fair Value and Notes Payable Associated with Structured Financings at Fair Value 

40 

     Table of Contents  

Our valuation of loans and fees receivable, at fair value is based on the present value of future cash flows using a valuation model of expected cash flows and the estimated cost to service and collect those cash flows. We estimate the present value of these future cash flows using a valuation model consisting of internally developed estimates of assumptions third-party market participants would use in determining fair value, including estimates of net collected yield, principal payment rates, expected principal credit loss rates, costs of funds, discount rates and servicing costs.  Similarly, our valuation of notes payable associated with structured financings, at fair value is based on the present value of future cash flows utilized in repayment of the outstanding principal and interest under the facilities using a valuation model of expected cash flows net of the contractual service expenses within the facilities. We estimate the present value of these future cash flows using a valuation model consisting of internally developed estimates of assumptions third-party market participants would use in determining fair value, including:  estimates of net collected yield, principal payment rates and expected principal credit loss rates on the credit card receivables that secure the non-recourse notes payable; costs of funds; discount rates; and contractual servicing fees. 
    
  The estimates for credit losses, payment rates, servicing costs, contractual servicing fees, costs of funds, discount rates and yields earned on credit card receivables significantly affect the reported amount of our loans and fees receivable, at fair value and our notes payable associated with structured financings, at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet, and they likewise affect our changes in fair value of loans and fees receivable recorded at fair value and changes in fair value of notes payable associated with structured financings recorded at fair value categories within our fees and related income on earning assets line item on our consolidated statement of operations. 
    
  Allowance for Uncollectible Loans and Fees 
    
  Through our analysis of loan performance, delinquency data, charge-off data, economic trends and the potential effects of those economic trends on consumers, we establish an allowance for uncollectible loans and fees receivable as an estimate of the probable losses inherent within those loans and fees receivable that we do not report at fair value. To the extent that actual results differ from our estimates of uncollectible loans and fees receivable, our results of operations and liquidity could be materially affected. 
    
  Revenue Recognition for Rental Merchandise 
    
  In our rent-to-own channel, contracts with consumers typically provide for 26, non-refundable, bi-weekly rental payments over a period of 12 months. The customer can take ownership of the merchandise by exercising a purchase option or making all required rental payments. We accrue periodic billed rental amounts (net of allowances for uncollectible billings) into revenues over the rental period to which the billed amounts relate, and we defer recognition in revenues of any advanced customer rental payments until the rental period in which they are properly recognizable under the terms of the contract. Additionally, we do not recognize a receivable for future periods' rental obligations due to us from consumers as consumers can terminate their rental agreements at any time with no further obligation to us, other than the return of rental merchandise.  
    
  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
    
  Under a shareholders  agreement into which we entered with David G. Hanna, Frank J. Hanna, III, Richard R. House, Jr., Richard W. Gilbert and certain trusts that were Hanna affiliates, following our initial public offering (1) if one or more of the shareholders accepts a bona fide offer from a third party to purchase more than 50% of the outstanding common stock, each of the other shareholders that is a party to the agreement may elect to sell his shares to the purchaser on the same terms and conditions, and (2) if shareholders that are a party to the agreement owning more than 50% of the common stock propose to transfer all of their shares to a third party, then such transferring shareholders may require the other shareholders that are a party to the agreement to sell all of the shares owned by them to the proposed transferee on the same terms and conditions. 
    
  In June 2007, we entered into a sublease for 1,000 square feet of excess office space at our Atlanta headquarters with HBR Capital, Ltd. ( HBR ), a company co-owned by David G. Hanna and his brother Frank J. Hanna, III. The sublease rate per square foot is the same as the rate that we pay under the prime lease. Under the sublease, HBR paid us $25,588 and $25,082 for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The aggregate amount of payments required under the sublease from January 1, 2016 to the expiration of the sublease in May 2022 is $176,820. 
    
  In January 2013, HBR began leasing four employees from us.  HBR reimburses us for the full cost of the employees, based on the amount of time devoted to HBR.  In the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, we received   $194,155   and $150,394, respectively, of reimbursed costs from HBR associated with these leased employees. 
       
  On November 26, 2014, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Dove Ventures, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company ( Dove ). The agreement provides for a senior secured term loan facility in  
  
   41 

     Table of Contents  

an amount of up to   $40.0 million   at any time outstanding, consisting of (i) an initial term loan of   $20.0 million  , and (ii) additional term loans available in the sole discretion of Dove and upon our request, provided that the aggregate amount of all outstanding term loans does not exceed   $40.0 million  . On November 26, 2014, Dove funded the initial term loan of   20.0 million  .  In November 2015, the agreement was amended to extend the maturity date of the term loan to   November 22, 2016  .  All other terms remained unchanged. Additionally, on July 28, 2016, we obtained an additional term loan under the Loan and Security Agreement.  As a result,  the Loan and Security Agreement is fully drawn with   $40.0 million   outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Our obligations under the agreement are guaranteed by certain subsidiary guarantors and secured by a pledge of certain assets of ours and the subsidiary guarantors. The loans bear interest at the rate of   9.0%   per annum, payable monthly in arrears. The principal amount of these loans is payable in a single installment on   November 22, 2016   (as amended). The agreement includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, as well as customary representations, warranties and events of default. Subject to certain conditions, we can prepay the principal amounts of these loans without premium or penalty.  
    
  Dove is a limited liability company owned by three trusts. David G. Hanna is the sole shareholder and the President of the corporation that serves as the sole trustee of one of the trusts, and David G. Hanna and members of his immediate family are the beneficiaries of this trust. Frank J. Hanna, III is the sole shareholder and the President of the corporation that serves as the sole trustee of the other two trusts, and Frank J. Hanna, III and members of his immediate family are the beneficiaries of these other two trusts.

Among the factors that could cause actual future results to differ materially from our expectations are the risks and uncertainties described under  Risk Factors  set forth in Part II, Item 1A, and the risk factors and other cautionary statements in other documents we file with the SEC, including the following: 
             
    the availability of adequate financing to support growth; 
                
    the extent to which federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulation of our various business lines and the products we service for others limits or prohibits the operation of our businesses; 
                
    current and future litigation and regulatory proceedings against us; 
     
   42 

     Table of Contents  

the effect of adverse economic conditions on our revenues, loss rates and cash flows; 
                
    competition from various sources providing similar financial products, or other alternative sources of credit, to consumers; 
                
    the adequacy of our allowances for uncollectible loans and fees receivable and estimates of loan losses used within our risk management and analyses; 
                
    the possible impairment of assets; 
                
    our ability to manage costs in line with the expansion or contraction of our various business lines; 
                
    our relationship with (i) the merchants that participate in point-of-sale finance operations and (ii) the banks that issue credit cards and provide certain other credit products utilizing our technology platform and related services; and 
                
    theft and employee errors. 
     Most of these factors are beyond our ability to predict or control. Any of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could materially affect our future financial condition or results of operations and the ultimate accuracy of our forward-looking statements. There also are other factors that we may not describe (because we currently do not perceive them to be material) that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. 
  We expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

We are involved in various legal proceedings that are incidental to the conduct of our business. There are currently no pending legal proceedings that are expected to be material to us.  
   
                 ITEM 1A. 
    RISK FACTORS 

An investment in our common stock or other securities involves a number of risks. You should carefully consider each of the risks described below before deciding to invest in our common stock or other securities. If any of the following risks develops into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected, the market price of our common stock or other securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. 
    
  Investors should be particularly cautious regarding investments in our common stock or other securities at the present time in light of the net contraction of our receivables levels over the last few years, uncertainties as to the profitability of our business model going forward and our inability to achieve consistent earnings from our operations in recent years. 
    
  Our Cash Flows and Net Income Are Dependent Upon Payments from Our Investments in Receivables 
    
  The collectibility of our investments in receivables is a function of many factors including the criteria used to select who is issued credit, the pricing of the credit products, the lengths of the relationships, general economic conditions, the rate at which consumers repay their accounts or become delinquent, and the rate at which consumers borrow funds.  Deterioration in these factors, which we have experienced over the past few years, adversely impacts our business.  In addition, to the extent we have over-estimated collectibility, in all likelihood we have over-estimated our financial performance. Some of these concerns are discussed more fully below. 
    
  Our portfolio of receivables is not diversified and originates from consumers whose creditworthiness is considered sub-prime.   Historically, we have invested in receivables in one of two ways we have either (i) invested in receivables originated by lenders who utilize our services or (ii) invested in or purchased pools of receivables from other issuers. In either case, substantially all of our receivables are from financially underserved borrowers borrowers represented by credit risks that regulators classify as  sub-prime.  Our reliance on sub-prime receivables has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact, our performance. Our various past and current losses might have been mitigated had our portfolios consisted of higher-grade receivables in addition to our sub-prime receivables.  
     
  Economic slowdowns increase our credit losses.   During periods of economic slowdown or recession, we experience an increase in rates of delinquencies and frequency and severity of credit losses. Our actual rates of delinquencies and frequency and severity of credit losses may be comparatively higher during periods of economic slowdown or recession than those experienced by more traditional providers of consumer credit because of our focus on the financially underserved consumer market, which may be disproportionately impacted. 
    
  We are subject to foreign economic and exchange risks.   Because of our operations in the U.K.,     we have exposure to fluctuations in the U.K. economy, and such fluctuations recently have been negative. We also have exposure to fluctuations in the relative values of the U.S. dollar and the British pound. Because the British pound has experienced a net decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar since we commenced our most significant operations in the U.K., we have experienced significant transaction and translation losses within our financial statements. 
    
  Because a significant portion of our reported income is based on management s estimates of the future performance of receivables, differences between actual and expected performance of the receivables may cause fluctuations in net income.   Significant portions of our reported income (or losses) are based on management s estimates of cash flows we expect to receive on receivables, particularly for such assets that we report based on fair value. The expected cash flows are based on management s estimates of interest rates, default rates, payment rates, cardholder purchases, servicing costs, and discount rates. These estimates are based on a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control. Substantial differences between actual and expected performance of the receivables will occur and cause fluctuations in our net income. For instance, higher than expected rates of delinquencies and losses could cause our net income to be lower than expected. Similarly, levels of loss and delinquency can result in our being required to repay lenders earlier than expected, thereby reducing funds available to us for future growth. Because all of the credit card receivables structured financing facilities are now in amortization status which for us generally means that the only meaningful cash flows that we are receiving with respect to the credit card receivables that are encumbered by such structured financing facilities are those associated with our  
  
   45 

     Table of Contents  

contractually specified fee for servicing the receivables recent payment and default trends have substantially reduced the cash flows that we receive from these receivables. 
    
    Due to our relative lack of historical experience with Internet consumers, we may not be able to evaluate their creditworthiness.   We have less historical experience with respect to the credit risk and performance of receivables owed by consumers acquired over the Internet. As a result, we may not be able to target and evaluate successfully the creditworthiness of these potential consumers. Therefore, we may encounter difficulties managing the expected delinquencies and losses and appropriately pricing products. 
    
  We Are Substantially Dependent Upon Borrowed Funds to Fund Receivables We Purchase 
    
  We finance receivables that we acquire in large part through financing facilities. All of our financing facilities are of finite duration (and ultimately will need to be extended or replaced) and contain financial covenants and other conditions that must be fulfilled in order for funding to be available. Moreover, some of our facilities currently are in amortization stages (and are not allowing for the funding of any new loans) based on their original terms.  The cost and availability of equity and borrowed funds is dependent upon our financial performance, the performance of our industry generally and general economic and market conditions, and at times equity and borrowed funds have been both expensive and difficult to obtain. 
    
  If additional financing facilities are not available in the future on terms we consider acceptable an issue that has been made even more acute in the U.S. given recent regulatory changes that have reduced asset-level returns on credit card lending we will not be able to purchase additional receivables and those receivables may contract in size. 
    
  Our Financial Performance Is, in Part, a Function of the Aggregate Amount of Receivables That Are Outstanding 
    
  The aggregate amount of outstanding receivables is a function of many factors including purchase rates, payment rates, interest rates, seasonality, general economic conditions, competition from credit card issuers and other sources of consumer financing, access to funding, and the timing and extent of our receivable purchases. 
    
  Despite our recent purchases of credit card receivables, our credit card receivables currently are contracting.   The amount of our credit card receivables is a product of a combination of factors, many of which are not in our control. Factors include: 

the availability of funding on favorable terms; 
                
    our relationships with the banks that issue credit cards; 
                
    the degree to which we lose business to competitors; 
                
    the level of usage of our credit card products by consumers; 
                
    the availability of portfolios for purchase on attractive terms; 
                
    levels of delinquencies and charge offs; 
                
    the level of costs of acquiring new receivables; 
                
    our ability to employ and train new personnel; 
                
    our ability to maintain adequate management systems, collection procedures, internal controls and automated systems; and 
                
    general economic and other factors beyond our control. 
       
  Reliance upon relationships with a few large retailers in the point-of-sale finance operations may adversely affect our revenues and operating results from these operations.      Our three largest retail partners accounted for over 45.0% of our point-of-sale finance revenue in 2015.  Although we are adding new retail partners on a regular basis, it is likely that we will continue to derive a significant portion of this operations  revenue from a relatively small number of partners in the future.  If a significant partner reduces or terminates its relationship with us, these operations  revenue could decline significantly and our operating results and financial condition could be harmed.  
    
  We Operate in a Heavily Regulated Industry 
    
  Changes in bankruptcy, privacy or other consumer protection laws, or to the prevailing interpretation thereof, may expose us to litigation, adversely affect our ability to collect receivables, or otherwise adversely affect our operations. Similarly, regulatory changes could adversely affect the ability or willingness of lenders who utilize our technology platform and related services to market credit products and services to consumers. Also, the accounting rules that apply to our business are exceedingly complex, difficult to apply and in a state of flux. As a result, how we value our receivables and otherwise account  
  
   46 

     Table of Contents  

for our business is subject to change depending upon the changes in, and, interpretation of, those rules. Some of these issues are discussed more fully below. 
    
  Reviews and enforcement actions by regulatory authorities under banking and consumer protection laws and regulations may result in changes to our business practices, may make collection of receivables more difficult or may expose us to the risk of fines, restitution and litigation.   Our operations and the operations of the issuing banks through which the credit products we service are originated are subject to the jurisdiction of federal, state and local government authorities, including the CFPB, the SEC, the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the FTC, U.K. banking authorities, state regulators having jurisdiction over financial institutions and debt origination and collection and state attorneys general. Our business practices and the practices of issuing banks, including the terms of products, servicing and collection practices, are subject to both periodic and special reviews by these regulatory and enforcement authorities. These reviews can range from investigations of specific consumer complaints or concerns to broader inquiries. If as part of these reviews the regulatory authorities conclude that we or issuing banks are not complying with applicable law, they could request or impose a wide range of remedies including requiring changes in advertising and collection practices, changes in the terms of products (such as decreases in interest rates or fees), the imposition of fines or penalties, or the paying of restitution or the taking of other remedial action with respect to affected consumers. They also could require us or issuing banks to stop offering some credit products or obtain licenses to do so, either nationally or in selected states. To the extent that these remedies are imposed on the issuing banks that originate credit products using our platform, under certain circumstances we are responsible for the remedies as a result of our indemnification obligations with those banks. We also may elect to change practices that we believe are compliant with law in order to respond to regulatory concerns. Furthermore, negative publicity relating to any specific inquiry or investigation could hurt our ability to conduct business with various industry participants or to generate new receivables and could negatively affect our stock price, which would adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital and would raise our costs of doing business. 
    
  If any deficiencies or violations of law or regulations are identified by us or asserted by any regulator, or if the CFPB, the FDIC, the FTC or any other regulator requires us or issuing banks to change any practices, the correction of such deficiencies or violations, or the making of such changes, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or business. In addition, whether or not these practices are modified when a regulatory or enforcement authority requests or requires, there is a risk that we or other industry participants may be named as defendants in litigation involving alleged violations of federal and state laws and regulations, including consumer protection laws. Any failure to comply with legal requirements by us or the banks that originate credit products utilizing our platform in connection with the issuance of those products, or by us or our agents as the servicer of our accounts, could significantly impair our ability to collect the full amount of the account balances. The institution of any litigation of this nature, or any judgment against us or any other industry participant in any litigation of this nature, could adversely affect our business and financial condition in a variety of ways. 
    
  We are dependent upon banks to issue credit cards and provide certain other credit products utilizing our technology platform and related services.   We acquire receivables generated by banks from credit cards that they have issued and other products, and their regulators could at any time limit their ability to issue some or all of these products that we service, or to modify those products significantly. Any significant interruption of those relationships would result in our being unable to acquire new receivables or help develop other credit products.  It is possible that a regulatory position or action taken with respect to any of the issuing banks might result in the bank s inability or unwillingness to originate future credit products in collaboration with us. In the current state, such a disruption of our issuing bank relationships principally would adversely affect our ability to grow our investments in the point-of-sale and direct-to-consumer receivables. 
    
  Changes to consumer protection laws or changes in their interpretation may impede collection efforts or otherwise adversely impact our business practices.   Federal and state consumer protection laws regulate the creation and enforcement of consumer credit card receivables and other loans. Many of these laws (and the related regulations) are focused on sub-prime lenders and are intended to prohibit or curtail industry-standard practices as well as non-standard practices. For instance, Congress enacted legislation that regulates loans to military personnel through imposing interest rate and other limitations and requiring new disclosures, all as regulated by the Department of Defense. Similarly, in 2009 Congress enacted legislation that required changes to a variety of marketing, billing and collection practices, and the Federal Reserve recently adopted significant changes to a number of practices through its issuance of regulations. Additionally, the CFPB is expected to be an active issuer of credit-related regulations in the near-term, and the scope and nature of those potential regulations are unknown.  While our practices are in compliance with these changes, some of the changes (e.g., limitations on the ability to assess up-front fees) have significantly affected the viability of certain credit products within the U.S. Changes in the consumer protection laws could result in the following: 

47 

     Table of Contents  

receivables not originated in compliance with law (or revised interpretations) could become unenforceable and uncollectible under their terms against the obligors; 
                
    we may be required to credit or refund previously collected amounts; 
                
    certain fees and finance charges could be limited, prohibited or restricted, which would reduce the profitability of certain investments in receivables; 
                
    certain collection methods could be prohibited, forcing us to revise our practices or adopt more costly or less effective practices; 
                
    limitations on our ability to recover on charged-off receivables regardless of any act or omission on our part; 
                
    some credit products and services could be banned in certain states or at the federal level; 
                
    federal or state bankruptcy or debtor relief laws could offer additional protections to consumers seeking bankruptcy protection, providing a court greater leeway to reduce or discharge amounts owed to us; and 
                
    a reduction in our ability or willingness to invest in receivables arising under loans to certain consumers, such as military personnel. 
       
  Material regulatory developments are likely to adversely impact our business and results from operations. 
    
  Our rent-to-own operations are regulated by and subject to the requirements of various federal and state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations, which may be amended or supplemented or interpreted by the courts from time to time, could expose us to significant compliance costs or burdens or force us to change our business practices in a manner that may be materially adverse to our operations, prospects or financial condition.   Currently, 47 states and the District of Columbia specifically regulate rent-to-own transactions. At the present time, no federal law specifically regulates the rent-to-own industry, although federal legislation to regulate the industry has been proposed from time to time. Any adverse changes in existing laws, or the passage of new adverse legislation by states or the federal government could materially increase both our costs of complying with laws and the risk that we could be sued or be subject to government sanctions if we are not in compliance. In addition, new burdensome legislation might force us to change our business model and might reduce the returns on our rent-to-own products. 
    
  Most of the states that regulate rent-to-own transactions have enacted disclosure laws that require rent-to-own companies to disclose to their consumers the total number of payments, total amount and timing of all payments to acquire ownership of any item, any other charges that may be imposed by them and miscellaneous other items. The more restrictive state lease purchase laws limit the total amount that a customer may be charged for an item, or regulate the amount of deemed  interest  that rent-to-own companies may charge on rent-to-own transactions, generally defining  interest  as lease fees paid in excess of the  retail  price of the goods. 
    
  There has been increased attention in the U.S. at both the state and federal levels, on consumer debt transactions in general, which may result in an increase in legislative and regulatory efforts directed at the rent-to-own industry. The federal government or states may enact additional or different legislation or regulation that would be disadvantageous or otherwise materially adverse to us.  
    
  In addition to the risk of lawsuits related to the laws that regulate rent-to-own and consumer lease transactions, we or our rent-to-own partners could be subject to lawsuits alleging violations of federal and state laws and regulations and consumer tort law, including fraud, consumer protection, information security and privacy laws, because of the consumer-oriented nature of the rent-to-own industry. A large judgment against us could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, an adverse outcome from a lawsuit, even one against one of our competitors, could result in changes in the way we and others in the industry do business, possibly leading to reduced returns on our rent-to-own products.  
    
  Our Automobile Lending Activities Involve Risks in Addition to Others Described Herein 
    
  Automobile lending exposes us not only to most of the risks described above but also to additional risks, including the regulatory scheme that governs installment loans and those attendant to relying upon automobiles and their repossession and liquidation value as collateral. In addition, our most significant active Auto Finance segment operation acquires loans on a wholesale basis from used car dealers, for which we rely upon the legal compliance and credit determinations by those dealers. 

48 

     Table of Contents  

Funding for automobile lending may become difficult to obtain and expensive.   In the event we are unable to renew or replace any Auto Finance segment facilities that bear refunding or refinancing risks when they become due, our Auto Finance segment could experience significant liquidity constraints and diminution in reported asset values as lenders retain significant cash flows within underlying structured financings or otherwise under security arrangements for repayment of their loans.  If we cannot renew or replace future facilities or otherwise are unduly constrained from a liquidity perspective, we may choose to sell part or all of our auto loan portfolios, possibly at less than favorable prices. 
    
  Our automobile lending business is dependent upon referrals from dealers.   Currently we provide substantially all of our automobile loans only to or through used car dealers. Providers of automobile financing have traditionally competed based on the interest rate charged, the quality of credit accepted and the flexibility of loan terms offered. In order to be successful, we not only need to be competitive in these areas, but also need to establish and maintain good relations with dealers and provide them with a level of service greater than what they can obtain from our competitors. 
    
  The financial performance of our automobile loan portfolio is in part dependent upon the liquidation of repossessed automobiles.   In the event of certain defaults, we may repossess automobiles and sell repossessed automobiles at wholesale auction markets located throughout the U.S. Auction proceeds from these types of sales and other recoveries rarely are sufficient to cover the outstanding balances of the contracts; where we experience these shortfalls, we will experience credit losses. Decreased auction proceeds resulting from depressed prices at which used automobiles may be sold would result in higher credit losses for us.  
    
  Repossession of automobiles entails the risk of litigation and other claims.   Although we have contracted with reputable repossession firms to repossess automobiles on defaulted loans, it is not uncommon for consumers to assert that we were not entitled to repossess an automobile or that the repossession was not conducted in accordance with applicable law. These claims increase the cost of our collection efforts and, if correct, can result in awards against us. 
    
  We Routinely Explore Various Opportunities to Grow Our Business, to Make Investments and to Purchase and Sell Assets 
    
  We routinely consider acquisitions of, or investments in, portfolios and other assets as well as the sale of portfolios and portions of our business. There are a number of risks attendant to any acquisition, including the possibility that we will overvalue the assets to be purchased and that we will not be able to produce the expected level of profitability from the acquired business or assets. Similarly, there are a number of risks attendant to sales, including the possibility that we will undervalue the assets to be sold. As a result, the impact of any acquisition or sale on our future performance may not be as favorable as expected and actually may be adverse. 
    
  Portfolio purchases may cause fluctuations in our reported Credit and Other Investments segment s managed receivables data, which may reduce the usefulness of this data in evaluating our business. Our reported Credit and Other Investments segment managed receivables data may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter as a result of recent and future credit card portfolio acquisitions.  
    
  Receivables included in purchased portfolios are likely to have been originated using credit criteria different from the criteria of issuing bank partners that have originated accounts utilizing our technology platform. Receivables included in any particular purchased portfolio may have significantly different delinquency rates and charge-off rates than the receivables previously originated and purchased by us. These receivables also may earn different interest rates and fees as compared to other similar receivables in our receivables portfolio. These variables could cause our reported managed receivables data to fluctuate substantially in future periods making the evaluation of our business more difficult. 
    
  Any acquisition or investment that we make will involve risks different from and in addition to the risks to which our business is currently exposed. These include the risks that we will not be able to integrate and operate successfully new businesses, that we will have to incur substantial indebtedness and increase our leverage in order to pay for the acquisitions, that we will be exposed to, and have to comply with, different regulatory regimes and that we will not be able to apply our traditional analytical framework (which is what we expect to be able to do) in a successful and value-enhancing manner. 
    
  Other Risks of Our Business     
    
  We are a holding company with no operations of our own  .    As a result, our cash flow and ability to service our debt is dependent upon distributions from our subsidiaries.  The distribution of subsidiary earnings, or advances or other distributions of funds by subsidiaries to us, all of which are subject to statutory and could be subject to contractual restrictions,  
  
   49 

     Table of Contents  

are contingent upon the subsidiaries  cash flows and earnings and are subject to various business and debt covenant considerations. 
    
  Unless we obtain a bank charter, we cannot issue credit cards other than through agreements with banks.   Because we do not have a bank charter, we currently cannot issue credit cards ourselves. Unless we obtain a bank or credit card bank charter, we will continue to rely upon banking relationships to provide for the issuance of credit cards to consumers. Even if we obtain a bank charter, there may be restrictions on the types of credit that the bank may extend. Our various issuing bank agreements have scheduled expiration dates. If we are unable to extend or execute new agreements with our issuing banks at the expirations of our current agreements with them, or if our existing or new agreements with our issuing banks were terminated or otherwise disrupted, there is a risk that we would not be able to enter into agreements with an alternate issuer on terms that we consider favorable or in a timely manner without disruption of our business. 
    
  We are party to litigation.   We are defendants in certain legal proceedings which include litigation customary for a business of our nature. In each case we believe that we have meritorious defenses or that the positions we are asserting otherwise are correct. However, adverse outcomes are possible in these matters, and we could decide to settle one or more of our litigation matters in order to avoid the ongoing cost of litigation or to obtain certainty of outcome. Adverse outcomes or settlements of these matters could require us to pay damages, make restitution, change our business practices or take other actions at a level, or in a manner, that would adversely impact our business. 
    
  We face heightened levels of economic risk associated with new investment activities.    We recently have made a number of investments in businesses that are not directly related to our traditional servicing and receivables financing activities to, or associated with, the underserved consumer credit market.  In addition, some of these investments that we have made and may make in the future are or will be in debt or equity securities of businesses over which we exert little or no control, which likely exposes us to greater risks of loss than investments in activities and operations that we control.  We make only those investments we believe have the potential to provide a favorable return.  However, because some of the investments are outside of our core areas of expertise, they entail risks beyond those described elsewhere in this Report.  As occurred with respect to certain such investments in 2012 and 2011, these risks could result in the loss of part or all of our investments. 
    
  Because we outsource account-processing functions that are integral to our business, any disruption or termination of that outsourcing relationship could harm our business.   We generally outsource account and payment processing, and in 2015, we paid Total System Services, Inc. $7.1 million for these services. If these agreements were not renewed or were terminated or the services provided to us were otherwise disrupted, we would have to obtain these services from an alternative provider. There is a risk that we would not be able to enter into a similar agreement with an alternate provider on terms that we consider favorable or in a timely manner without disruption of our business. 
    
  If we are unable to protect our information systems against service interruption our operations could be disrupted and our reputation may be damaged.   We rely heavily on networks and information systems and other technology, that are largely hosted by third-parties to support our business processes and activities, including processes integral to the origination and collection of loans and other financial products, and information systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting and legal and tax requirements. Because information systems are critical to many of our operating activities, our business may be impacted by hosted system shutdowns, service disruptions or security breaches. These incidents may be caused by failures during routine operations such as system upgrades or user errors, as well as network or hardware failures, malicious or disruptive software, computer hackers, rogue employees or contractors, cyber-attacks by criminal groups, geopolitical events, natural disasters, failures or impairments of telecommunications networks, or other catastrophic events.  If our information systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, and we may lose revenue and profits as a result of our inability to collect payments in a timely manner. We also could be required to spend significant financial and other resources to repair or replace networks and information systems.  
    
  Unauthorized or unintentional disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer data could expose us to protracted and costly litigation, and civil and criminal penalties.    To conduct our business, we are required to manage, use, and store large amounts of personally identifiable information, consisting primarily of confidential personal and financial data regarding consumers across all operations areas. We also depend on our IT networks and systems, and those of third parties, to process, store, and transmit this information. As a result, we are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state laws designed to protect this information. Security breaches involving our files and infrastructure could lead to unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.

We take a number of measures to ensure the security of our hardware and software systems and customer information. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect data being breached or compromised. In the past, banks and other service providers have been the subject of sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on their information technology. An increasing number of websites have reported breaches of their security. 
    
  If any person, including our employees or those of third-party vendors, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to costly litigation, monetary damages, fines, and/or criminal prosecution. We do not maintain cyber-security insurance liability coverage and as such we are exposed to the financial risk and losses associated with such incidents.  Any unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information could subject us to liability under data privacy laws.  Further, under credit card rules and our contracts with our card processors, if there is a breach of credit card information that we store, we could be liable to the credit card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. In addition, if we fail to follow credit card industry security standards, even if there is no compromise of customer information, we could incur significant fines.  Security breaches also could harm our reputation, which could potentially cause decreased revenues, the loss of existing merchant credit partners, or difficulty in adding new merchant credit partners.  
    
  Internet and data security breaches also could impede us from originating loans over the Internet, cause us to lose consumers or otherwise damage our reputation or business.    Consumers generally are concerned with security and privacy, particularly on the Internet.  As part of our growth strategy, we have enabled lenders to originate loans over the Internet. The secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet is essential to maintaining customer confidence in such products and services offered online. 
    
  Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by us to protect our client or consumer application and transaction data transmitted over the Internet.  In addition to the potential for litigation and civil penalties described above, security breaches could damage our reputation and cause consumers to become unwilling to do business with our clients or us, particularly over the Internet. Any publicized security problems could inhibit the growth of the Internet as a means of conducting commercial transactions. Our ability to service our clients' needs over the Internet would be severely impeded if consumers become unwilling to transmit confidential information online. 
    
  Also, a party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information, cause interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of our users, or otherwise damage our reputation and business. 
    
  Regulation in the areas of privacy and data security could increase our costs.    We are subject to various regulations related to privacy and data security/breach, and we could be negatively impacted by these regulations. For example, we are subject to the safeguards guidelines under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The safeguards guidelines require that each financial institution develop, implement and maintain a written, comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution s size and complexity, the nature and scope of the financial institution s activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue. Broad-ranging data security laws that affect our business also have been adopted by various states. Compliance with these laws regarding the protection of consumer and employee data could result in higher compliance and technology costs for us, as well as potentially significant fines and penalties for non-compliance.  Further, there are various other statutes and regulations relevant to the direct email marketing, debt collection and text-messaging industries including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.  The interpretation of many of these statutes and regulations is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply with them may have an adverse impact on our business. 
    
  In addition to the foregoing enhanced data security requirements, various federal banking regulatory agencies, and as many as 48 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, have enacted data security regulations and laws requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach. 
    
  Also, federal legislators and regulators are increasingly pursuing new guidelines, laws and regulations that, if adopted, could further restrict how we collect, use, share and secure consumer information, which could impact some of our current or planned business initiatives.

Unplanned system interruptions or system failures could harm our business and reputation.    Any interruption in the availability of our transactional processing services due to hardware and operating system failures will reduce our revenues and profits. Any unscheduled interruption in our services results in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenues. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential consumers to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our websites or services, and could permanently harm our reputation. 
    
  Although our systems have been designed around industry-standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences, they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, and similar events or disruptions. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Our systems also are subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism. Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster, a decision by any of our third-party hosting providers to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons, or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could cause system interruptions, delays, and loss of critical data, and result in lengthy interruptions in our services. Our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures. 
    
  Climate change and related regulatory responses may impact our business  .  Climate change as a result of emissions of greenhouse gases is a significant topic of discussion and may generate federal and other regulatory responses.  It is impracticable to predict with any certainty the impact on our business of climate change or the regulatory responses to it, although we recognize that they could be significant.  The most direct impact is likely to be an increase in energy costs, which would adversely impact consumers and their ability to incur and repay indebtedness.  However, we are uncertain of the ultimate impact, either directionally or quantitatively, of climate change and related regulatory responses on our business. 
    
  Risks Relating to an Investment in Our Securities 
    
  The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for you to resell your shares of our common stock when you want or at prices you find attractive.   The price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market constantly changes. We expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include the following: 

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results; 
                
    changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors; 
                
    the overall financing environment, which is critical to our value; 
                
    the operating and stock performance of our competitors; 
                
    announcements by us or our competitors of new products or services or significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; 
                
    changes in interest rates; 
                
    the announcement of enforcement actions or investigations against us or our competitors or other negative publicity relating to us or our industry; 
                
    changes in GAAP, laws, regulations or the interpretations thereof that affect our various business activities and segments; 
                
    general domestic or international economic, market and political conditions; 
                
    changes in ownership by executive officers, directors and parties related to them who control a majority of our common stock; 
                
    additions or departures of key personnel; and 
                
    future sales of our common stock and the transfer or cancellation of shares of common stock pursuant to a share lending agreement. 
       
  In addition, the stock markets from time to time experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. These broad fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. 
    
  Future sales of our common stock or equity-related securities in the public market, including sales of our common stock pursuant to share lending agreements or short sale transactions by purchasers of convertible senior notes, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings.    Sales of  
  
   52 

     Table of Contents  

significant amounts of our common stock or equity-related securities in the public market, including sales pursuant to share lending agreements, or the perception that such sales will occur, could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities. Future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale, including sales of our common stock in short sale transactions by purchasers of our convertible senior notes, may have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock. 
    
  We have the ability to issue preferred stock, warrants, convertible debt and other securities without shareholder approval.   Our common stock may be subordinate to classes of preferred stock issued in the future in the payment of dividends and other distributions made with respect to common stock, including distributions upon liquidation or dissolution. Our articles of incorporation permit our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without first obtaining shareholder approval. If we issued preferred stock, these additional securities may have dividend or liquidation preferences senior to the common stock. If we issue convertible preferred stock, a subsequent conversion may dilute the current common shareholders  interest. We have similar abilities to issue convertible debt, warrants and other equity securities. 
    
  Our executive officers, directors and parties related to them, in the aggregate, control a majority of our common stock and may have the ability to control matters requiring shareholder approval.   Our executive officers, directors and parties related to them own a large enough share of our common stock to have an influence on, if not control of, the matters presented to shareholders. As a result, these shareholders may have the ability to control matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election and removal of directors, the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as any reclassification, reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and the control of our management and affairs. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of us, impede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. 
    
  The right to receive payments on our convertible senior notes is subordinated to the rights of our existing and future secured creditors.   Our convertible senior notes are unsecured and are subordinate to existing and future secured obligations to the extent of the value of the assets securing such obligations. As a result, in the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or similar proceeding of our company, our assets generally would be available to satisfy obligations of our secured debt before any payment may be made on the convertible senior notes. To the extent that such assets cannot satisfy in full our secured debt, the holders of such debt would have a claim for any shortfall that would rank equally in right of payment (or effectively senior if the debt were issued by a subsidiary) with the convertible senior notes. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts on any or all of the convertible senior notes.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Atlanticus Holdings Corporation had outstanding:   $92.7 million   of secured indebtedness, which would rank senior in right of payment to the convertible senior notes;   $34.1 million   of senior unsecured indebtedness in addition to the convertible senior notes that would rank equal in right of payment to the convertible senior notes; and no subordinated indebtedness. Included in senior secured indebtedness are certain guarantees we have executed in favor of our subsidiaries.  For more information on our outstanding indebtedness, See Note 7, "Notes Payable," to our consolidated financial statements included herein. 
  Our convertible senior notes are junior to the indebtedness of our subsidiaries.   Our convertible senior notes are structurally subordinated to the existing and future claims of our subsidiaries  creditors. Holders of the convertible senior notes are not creditors of our subsidiaries. Any claims of holders of the convertible senior notes to the assets of our subsidiaries derive from our own equity interests in those subsidiaries. Claims of our subsidiaries  creditors will generally have priority as to the assets of our subsidiaries over our own equity interest claims and will therefore have priority over the holders of the convertible senior notes. Consequently, the convertible senior notes are effectively subordinate to all liabilities, whether or not secured, of any of our subsidiaries and any subsidiaries that we may in the future acquire or establish. Our subsidiaries  creditors also may include general creditors and taxing authorities. As of   September 30, 2016  , our subsidiaries had total liabilities of approximately   $184.6 million   (including the   $92.7 million   of senior secured indebtedness mentioned above), excluding intercompany indebtedness. In addition, in the future, we may decide to increase the portion of our activities that we conduct through subsidiaries. 
    
  Note Regarding Risk Factors 
    
  The risk factors presented above are all of the ones that we currently consider material. However, they are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks not presently known to us, or which we currently consider immaterial, also may adversely  
  
   53 

     Table of Contents  

affect us. There may be risks that a particular investor views differently from us, and our analysis might be wrong. If any of the risks that we face actually occurs, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected and could differ materially from any possible results suggested by any forward-looking statements that we have made or might make. In such case, the trading price of our common stock or other securities could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.    We expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 
    
  The following table sets forth information with respect to our repurchases of common stock during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

(1) 
    Because withholding tax-related stock repurchases are permitted outside the scope of our 5,000,000 share Board-authorized repurchase plan, these amounts exclude shares of stock returned to us by employees in satisfaction of withholding tax requirements on vested stock grants.  There were 207 such shares returned to us during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
        
  We will continue to evaluate our stock price relative to other investment opportunities and, to the extent we believe that the repurchase of our stock represents an appropriate return of capital, we will repurchase shares of our stock.
