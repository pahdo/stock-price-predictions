UNITED CANNABIS CORPORATION    
  NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015  
   
  NOTE 1  BUSINESS ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS  
   
   Background and Current Operations   
   
 United Cannabis Corporation ( we ,  our ,  us ,  UCANN , or  the Company ) a Colorado corporation, was originally formed as a California corporation under the name MySkin, Inc. on November 15, 2007. MySkin was engaged in the business of providing management services to a medical spa in Los Angeles, California which provided various advanced skin care services until March 31, 2014, when this business was sold to the prior President of the Company. 
   
 In early 2014 we decided to exit the medical spa management business and change our focus to providing products, services and intellectual property to the cannabis industry. 
   
 On March 26, 2014, we entered into a License Agreement with Earnest Blackmon, Tony Verzura and Chad Ruby pursuant to which Messrs. Blackmon, Verzura and Ruby licensed certain intellectual property to us in exchange for a total of 38,690,000 shares of our common stock. 
   
 In connection with this transaction: 

Messrs. Blackmon, Verzura and Ruby licensed to us all of their knowledge and know-how relating to the design and buildout of cultivation facilities, growing/cultivation systems, seed-to-sale protocols and procedures, products, a genetic catalogue including over 150 different strains, an advanced (non-psychoactive) cannabinoid therapy program called  A.C.T. Now , security, regulatory compliance, and other methods and processes which relate to the cannabis industry. 

The territory for this license is the entire world and the license runs in perpetuity. There are no royalty payments under the License Agreement. 

Messrs. Blackmon, Verzura and Ruby were appointed to our board of directors effective April 7, 2014. 

Mr. Blackmon was elected as our President, Mr. Ruby was elected as Chief Operating Officer and Mr. Verzura was elected as Vice President. 

A total of 41,690,000 previously outstanding shares of common stock were cancelled resulting in a total of 43,620,000 shares of common stock outstanding on March 26, 2014. 

UCANN was formed as a Colorado corporation on March 25, 2014, and on May 2, 2014, MySkin, Inc. merged into UCANN, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MySkin, Inc., for the purpose of changing domicile from California to Colorado and changing the corporation's name to United Cannabis Corporation. 
   
 On March 31, 2014, we sold all right, title and interest in the tangible and intangible assets, trademarks, customer lists, intellectual property and rights, which we owned and were related to our advanced skin care business since we entered into a new business and no longer had any use for these assets. The assets were sold to MySkin Services, Inc. ( MTA ), a business partly owned by Marichelle Stoppenhagen, our former officer and director, in exchange for the $15,000 payable which we owed to Ms. Stoppenhagen and/or MTA.  In addition, MTA assumed all costs associated with these assets starting on March 31, 2014. 
   
   Government Regulation   - Marijuana is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal laws.

UNITED CANNABIS CORPORATION  
  NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015  

As of September 30, 2016, 23 states and the District of Columbia allow their citizens to use medical marijuana, and voters in the states of Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska and the District of Columbia approved ballot measures to legalize cannabis for adult recreational use.  The state laws are in conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level. The Obama administration has effectively stated that it is not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical and recreational marijuana. However, there is no guarantee that the current administration will not change its stated policy regarding the low-priority enforcement of federal laws, or that any future administration would not change this policy and decide to enforce the federal laws vigorously.  Any such change in the federal government s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us.   
   
  NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
   Basis of Presentation   - We prepared these condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In our opinion, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three month and nine month periods ended September 31, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. While we believe that the disclosures presented herein are adequate and not misleading, these interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the footnotes thereto contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
   
   Principles of Consolidation     Our condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries UC Nevada L.L.C. and UC Colorado Corporation. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 
   
   Use of Estimates   - The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. 
   
 We make our estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared. We recognize changes in estimates in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available. We believe that our significant estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, based upon information available at the time they were made. Our actual results could differ from these estimates, making it possible that a change in these estimates could occur in the near term. 
   
   Financial Instruments     We have adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 825,  Financial Instruments , which requires disclosures of information about the fair value of certain financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value. For purposes of this disclosure, the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced sale or liquidation. 
   
 The carrying amounts of our short-term financial instruments, including accounts receivable, , accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred revenue approximates fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity for these instruments. Investments in non-marketable equity securities are carried at cost. The carrying amount of our notes payable at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, approximates their fair values based on our incremental borrowing rates. 
   
   Cash and Cash Equivalents   - We consider investments with original maturities of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. We did not have cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

UNITED CANNABIS CORPORATION  
  NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015  

Accounts Receivable     Our accounts receivable consists primarily of trade accounts arising in the normal course of business. No interest is charged on past due accounts. Accounts for which no payments have been received after 30 days are considered delinquent and customary collection efforts are initiated. Accounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less a reserve made for doubtful accounts based on a review of all outstanding amounts on a monthly basis. 
   
 We determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering the customer s financial condition and credit history, and current economic conditions. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was $30,000 and $4,340 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
   
   Intangible Assets     Our intangible assets, consisting of trademarks, design marks and provisional patent applications are recorded at cost, and once approved, will be amortized using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of 10 to 20 years. We test for impairment of our intangible assets on an annual basis. 
   
   Investments in Non-Marketable Equity Securities     Our investments in non-marketable equity securities are carried at cost, less write-down-for-impairments, and are adjusted for impairment based on methodologies, and assessment of the impact of general private equity market conditions, and discounted projected future cash flows. Investments in non-marketable equity securities that expire in less than 12 months, for example stock options or warrants, are classified as current assets; otherwise, we classify investments in non-marketable equity securities as noncurrent assets. 
   
   Long-Lived Assets    In accordance with ASC 350, we regularly review the carrying value of intangible and other long-lived assets for the existence of facts or circumstances, both internally and externally, that suggest impairment. The carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon our estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use. If our expectations of future results and cash flows are significantly diminished, intangible assets and other long-lived assets may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material. When we determine that the carrying value of intangibles or other long-lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, we use the projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine whether an impairment exists, and then measure the impairment using discounted cash flows. 
   
   Equity Method Investments     Our investments in entities representing ownership of at least 20% but less than 50%, where we exercise significant influence, are accounted for under the equity method. 
   
   Deferred Revenue   - We defer revenue for which product or service has not yet been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that we and our customer jointly determine that the product or service has been delivered or no refund will be required. 
   
   Revenue Recognition -   We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 605,  Revenue Recognition , which requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) is based on our management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products and services delivered and the collectability of those amounts. 
   
 Revenue for services with a payment in form of stock, warrants or other financial assets is recognized when the services are performed. The value of revenue is measured using the Black-Scholes model for warrants. 
   
   Cost of Revenues   - Our cost of revenues consists primarily of costs associated with the production and delivery of our products and services. These include expenses related to the production, packaging and labeling of our Prana medicinals products and consulting expense related to our advisory services. 
   
   Research and Development Expenses -   Research and development ( R D ) costs are charged to expense as incurred. Our R D costs include, but are not limited to, consulting service fees and materials and supplies used in the development of our proprietary products and services. 
   
   General and Administrative Expenses -   General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, rent, corporate costs, fees for professional and consulting services, advertising costs, and other costs of administration such as marketing, human resources, finance and administrative roles.

UNITED CANNABIS CORPORATION  
  NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015  

Stock-Based Compensation   - We periodically issue shares of our common stock to non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for fees and services. We account for stock issued to non-employees in accordance with ASC 505,  Equity , whereas the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either (a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached, or (b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. 
   
 We account for stock option grants issued and vesting to employees based on ASC 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation , whereas the award is measured at its fair value at the date of grant and is amortized ratably over the vesting period. Accounting for stock-based compensation to employees requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees based on estimated fair values. We estimate the fair value of all stock option awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model, which is affected by our stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee option exercise behaviors, risk free interest rates and expected dividends. We also estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from our estimates. 
   
   Income Taxes   - We follow the provisions of ASC 740,  Income Taxes . Under ASC 740 deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. 
   
   Commitments and Contingencies   - Certain conditions may exist as of the date our condensed consolidated financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur.  We assess such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment.  In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, we evaluate the perceived merits of the legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. 
   
 If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in our condensed consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material, would be disclosed. 
   
 Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the nature of the guarantee would be disclosed. 
   
   Net Income Loss Per Share   - We compute net loss per share in accordance with ASC 260,  Earnings per Share . Under the provisions of ASC 260, basic net loss per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing the net loss available to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share takes into consideration shares of common stock outstanding (computed under basic net loss per share) and potentially dilutive securities that are not anti-dilutive. 
   
  Potentially dilutive securities outlined in the table below have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share, because the effect of their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.

  NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015  

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)     We report as other comprehensive income (loss) those revenues, gains and losses not included in the determination of net income.  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we did not have any gains and losses resulting from activities or transactions that resulted in comprehensive income or loss. 
   
   Segment Reporting     UCANN operates as one segment. 
   
   Concentration of Credit Risk   - Financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist of cash. Because of our perceived association with the marijuana industry, we are not always able to maintain our cash with high credit quality financial institutions; and at times, cash is held by our employees, under the terms of trust agreements, and as a result, these balances are not insured by the FDIC. 
   
 The following tables show significant concentrations in our revenues and accounts receivable for the periods indicated: 
   
 Percentage of Revenues: 

Percentage of Accounts Receivable: 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   - From time to time, the FASB or other standards setting bodies issue new accounting pronouncements. Updates to the FASB ASCs are communicated through issuance of an Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ). Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued guidance, whether adopted or to be adopted in the future, is not expected to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 
   
 In May 2014 the FASB issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers, which implements a five step process of how an entity should recognize revenue in order to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance will be effective at the beginning of fiscal year 2017, and early application is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing reporting. 
   
  NOTE 3   GOING CONCERN  
   
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes we will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred losses of $962,953 and used cash of $258,607 in operating activities. At September 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $2,132,349 and an accumulated deficit of $6,471,282.  Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate profitable operations in the future and, or, obtaining the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. There is no assurance that these events will be satisfactorily completed.

  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015  

NOTE 4   INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES  
   
 On June 9, 2014, we received 1,187,500 common shares; and 3,000,000 warrants, which expired unexercised, to purchase shares of common stock of WeedMD RX Inc. ( WMD ), a private Canadian company in the cannabis industry, in exchange for future consulting services and use of our intellectual property. The $593,750 cost assigned to the WMD shares was classified as investment in non-marketable equity securities and as a component of deferred revenue in the amount of $593,750 on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
   
 On March 24, 2016, an unrelated third party agreed to assume all of our obligations, including accrued and unpaid interest, pursuant to the terms of a $175,000 note payable we owed to WeedMD, in consideration for the transfer by us of 1,100,000 shares of the common stock of WMD to the unrelated third party. WMD consented to the assumption of the loan by the unrelated third party, and released us from any further liability with respect to the loan.  After the transfer of the 1,100,000 shares of common stock of WMD to the unrelated third party, we own 87,500 shares of common stock of WMD, and reduced our investment in none-marketable equity securities to $15, 125. 
   
  NOTE 5   PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS  
   
 Prepaid expenses and other assets consist of: 

NOTE 6   INTANGIBLES   
   
  Our intangible assets are comprised of provisional patent applications and applications for a design mark and trademarks. Our intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of 20 years for patents and 10 years for design marks and trademarks once the applications are approved. Costs associated with applications that are not approved will be expensed in the period that the application is rejected or abandoned.  
   
   NOTE 7   EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS   
   
  On August 15, 2014, we acquired a 50% interest in Cannabinoid Research   Development Company Limited ( CRD ), a Jamaican company, in exchange for 40,000 shares of our common stock valued at $88,000 based on the previous day s closing price of our stock. We also committed to provide expertise on design-build, genetics, cultivation, production, processing, productizing, labeling, packaging, marketing, branding and distribution of products, as well as use of our intellectual property in the operations of CRD. As of September 30, 2016, CRD did not have any operations or operating activities. We accounted for this $88,000 as an equity method investment on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.

   NOTE 9   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES   
   
 The following table provides the liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016. 

Convertible Notes Payable    
   
 We valued our derivative liabilities related to embedded conversion features applicable to our borrowings of $322,000 under our convertible notes payable with embedded derivative features (see Note 12 below) and accrued interest payable of $28,724 thereon in accordance with fair value measurement guidelines. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the following table reconciles the beginning and ending balances for our financial instruments that are carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis: 

The estimated fair value of the derivative liabilities related to our convertible notes payable was measured as the aggregate estimated fair value of each component of the compound embedded derivative liabilities (see Note 12 below), based on Level 2 and Level 3 inputs, using a binomial  lattice pricing model. Changes in the fair value of the compound embedded derivative liability at each reporting date are included in gain/ (loss) on derivative liabilities in our consolidated statement of operations. 
   
  NOTE 10   DEFERRED REVENUE  
   
  Our deferred revenue consists of:

  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015  

As described in Note 4 above, on June 9, 2014, we received 1,187,500 common shares and 3,000,000 warrants to purchase common shares of WMD in exchange for future consulting services and use of our intellectual property. We recorded the $893,750 fair value of these securities as deferred revenue, and we recognized $150,000 of this amount as revenue during the period July 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014, based upon our initial three year estimate of the service period involved. Based on consultations with WMD, we expect to deliver the remaining consulting services and use of our intellectual property to WMD on a relatively consistent monthly basis during the four year period January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2018. Accordingly, we are now recognizing $15,000 of deferred revenue per month, and thus, during the three and nine month periods September 30 2016 and 2015, we recognized a total of $45,000 and $135,000 of revenue applicable to this arrangement, respectively. At September 30, 2016, we expect to recognize $180,000 of the remaining $428,751 WMD deferred revenue during the next twelve months and accordingly, we have classified the $180,000 as a current liability on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.  
   
 On December 28, 2014, we entered into a royalty and consulting services agreement with FoxBarry Farms, LLC ( FoxBarry ) whereby we received a $200,000 prepaid royalty payment from FoxBarry, which we classified on our balance sheet as deferred revenue. Over the past twelve months, in spite of repeated efforts by our management, we have not been able to communicate with, or locate the principals of FoxBarry; and further, our research indicates that FoxBarry has ceased doing business, and is no longer an operating entity. When we entered into the transaction with FoxBarry, it was our policy to recognize the related deferred royalty revenue, based on actual applicable sales as defined in the agreement.  However, since FoxBarry appears to no longer be in existence, and all of our conditions pursuant to the agreement have been satisfied, we elected to recognize $200,000 of deferred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. For the three and nine months ended September 2015, we did not recognize any deferred revenue related to this agreement. 
   
  NOTE 11   NOTES PAYABLE   
   
 Our notes payable consisted of the following: 

On July 7, 2014, we issued a $175,000, unsecured demand promissory note bearing interest at 5% to WeedMD for cash used in our business development activities. As discussed in Note 4 above, on March 24, 2016, an unrelated third party agreed to assume all of our obligations pursuant to the $175,000 note payable to WeedMD, in consideration for the transfer by us of 1,100,000 shares of the common stock of WeedMD to the unrelated third party. WeedMD consented to the assumption of the loan and released us from any further liability with respect to the loan. 
   
 On December 18, 2014, we issued a $600,000 unsecured promissory note bearing interest at 12% to an unrelated third party, Slainte Ventures, LLC. The principal and accrued interest are due on the earlier of December 17, 2015, or  upon the closing of certain capital raising transactions as described in the note. The default rate of interest under the note is 18%.

  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015  

On March 16, 2016, we entered into an agreement with Slainte whereby Slainte waived default, amended the terms and extended the maturity date of the Slainte Note until December 17, 2016, and agreed to accept a warrant in lieu of interest due on the loan. The warrant allows Slainte to purchase 416,667 shares of our common stock; plus that number of shares of our common stock equal in number to (i) the product of the then-applicable interest rate under the Slainte Note and the amount of principal outstanding on the Note, calculated on a daily basis and paid for actual days elapsed, during the period beginning on December 18, 2015, and ending on the date on which the Note is paid in full, divided by (ii) $0.18; plus that number of shares of our common stock equal in number to (i) the product of 0.02 and the sum of the amount of principal and interest outstanding on the Note on the first day of each calendar month, beginning with February 1, 2016, divided by (ii) $0.18. The warrant is exercisable at a price of $0.18 per share, subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, the sale of our shares of common stock at a price below $0.18 per share or the sale of equity securities with a conversion price of less than $0.18 per share. The warrant can be exercised at any time during the five year period following the full repayment of the loan; the exercise price can be paid in cash or through a cashless exercise feature; and the warrant grants certain registration rights to Slainte applicable to all shares of our common stock owned or controlled by Slainte, including shares issued upon exercise of the warrant. In addition, Slainte granted us a put option, exercisable upon repayment of the loan prior to December 17, 2016, that requires Slainte to purchase from us, for $100,000, that number of shares of our common stock equal in number to (i) $100,000 divided by (ii) the product of 80% and the average price of our common stock for the 30 trading days immediately prior to the date the put option is exercised. 
   
 These warrants are accounted for as a liability under ASC 815. The Company assesses the fair value of the warrants quarterly based on the Black-Scholes pricing model. See below for variables used in assessing the fair value. 

In connection with these warrants, the Company recognized a loss on the change in fair value of warrant liability of $310,173 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
   
 Expected volatility is based primarily on historical volatility. Historical volatility was computed using weekly pricing observations for recent periods that correspond to the expected life of the warrants. The Company believes this method produces an estimate that is representative of our expectations of future volatility over the expected term of these warrants. The Company currently has no reason to believe future volatility over the expected remaining life of these warrants is likely to differ materially from historical volatility. The expected life is based on the remaining term of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury securities rates. 
   
 Due to the fair value of the warrants issued in connection with the amended note agreement, the modification was considered substantial (i.e. greater than 10% of the carrying value of the debt). As a result, an extinguishment of debt was deemed to have occurred, resulting in the recognition of an extinguishment loss of $133,077.

  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015  

NOTE 12   CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE  
   
 During the year ended 2015, we issued three convertible promissory notes to unaffiliated third parties. The net proceeds from these transactions were used for general working capital purposes. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we issued four convertible promissory notes, the net proceeds from which were used to pay the principal and accrued interest of two of the convertible notes issued during the year ended December 31, 2015. The difference between the face amount of the convertible notes and the net proceeds was recorded as deferred financing costs on our consolidated balance sheets, if such difference was the result of payments related to debt issuance costs. Any deferred financing costs are amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest rate method, during the first 180 days that the convertible notes are outstanding, and this amortization is included in interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations. 
   
 The following table summarizes our convertible promissory notes as of September 30, 2016: 

The convertible notes, including accrued interest payable, may be converted into shares of our common stock at the Conversion Price, in whole, or in part, at various times, after the date of issuance, at the option of the holder (the  Conversion Feature ), as defined by the terms of the convertible note. 
   
 The Conversion Price is equal the Base Conversion Rate specified in the table above multiplied by the Variable Conversion Rate ( VCR ), which is equal to the lowest trading price or closing bid price of our common stock during the ten trading day period prior to the date of conversion, divided by the closing price of our common stock on the day of conversion. 
   
 If these conversion rates results in a beneficial conversion feature ( BCF ), the BCF is recorded as an unamortized convertible debt discount, which is required to be valued and amortized to interest expense over the term of the Note. We amortize our convertible debt discount on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest rate method, and this amortization is included in amortization of debt discount in our consolidated statements of operations. If a convertible note is repaid, any remaining unamortized deferred financing costs and unamortized debt discount are expensed on the date of repayment. 
   
 If a convertible notes is convertible into an unlimited number of unregistered, restricted common shares, it is classified as having and unlimited shares feature ( Unlimited Shares Feature ). The difference between the closing price of our common stock and the VCR is referred to as the Variable Conversion Rate Differential ( VCRD ). If, both the Unlimited Shares Feature and the VCRD meet the definition of an embedded derivative, then together they create a compound embedded derivative liability or, hereafter, simply a  derivative liability.  
   
 In accordance with U.S. GAAP, our derivative liabilities are recorded at fair value on the date of issuance and subsequently remeasured to fair value each reporting period with any change in fair value being recognized as gain (loss) on derivative liabilities in our consolidated statement of operations.

  NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015  

Similarly, accrued interest payable applicable to the convertible notes is convertible into shares of our common stock, without limit, at the same Conversion Price. The fair value of the derivative liabilities applicable to accrued interest payable is measured and recognized at each reporting date as derivative liabilities with a corresponding charge to interest expense.  As noted above, all derivative liabilities are re-measured in subsequent reporting periods with any change in fair value being included in gain (loss) on derivative liabilities. 
   
 At September 30, 2016, we have reserved 10.2 million shares of our authorized but unissued common stock for potential conversion of the convertible notes. 
   
   Slainte Convertible Notes   
   
 On March 30, 2016, we borrowed $81,978, from Slainte Ventures and used the proceeds to repay principal and accrued interest applicable to our $59,000 convertible promissory note dated October 6, 2015, to Vis Vires Group, Inc. The loan, together with interest at 12% per year, is payable on December 30, 2016. We can prepay the loan at any time. If the loan is repaid on or before September 30, 2016, the principal amount which is being repaid will increase by 10%. If the loan is repaid after September 30, 2016, the principal amount which is being repaid will increase by 15%. The amount of the principal increase may be paid with shares of our common stock. The number of shares to be issued for such purpose will be determined by dividing the average closing price of our common stock (which in no case can be greater than $0.45) for the ten trading days preceding the prepayment date. If the loan is not paid when due, then at any time on or before January 10, 2017, Slainte may convert the outstanding principal and interest on the loan into shares of our common stock. The number of shares to be issued on conversion will be determined by dividing the average closing price of our common stock (which in no case can be greater than $0.45) for the ten trading days preceding the conversion date by the outstanding principal and interest on the loan on the conversion date. 
   
 On April 6, 2016, we borrowed $75,000 from Slainte Ventures and used the proceeds, along with $52,500 of advances to the Company by officers and directors of the Company, to repay principal and accrued interest applicable to our $102,000 convertible promissory note, dated October 12, 2015, to JSJ Investments, Inc. The loan, together with interest at 12% per year, is payable on December 30, 2016. We can prepay the loan at any time. If the loan is repaid on or before September 30, 2016, the principal amount which is being repaid will increase by 10%. If the loan is repaid after September 30, 2016, the principal amount which is being repaid will increase by 15%. The amount of the principal increase may be paid with shares of our common stock. The number of shares to be issued for such purpose will be determined by dividing the average closing price of our common stock (which in no case can be greater than $0.45) for the ten trading days preceding the prepayment date. If the loan is not paid when due, then at any time on or before January 10, 2017, Slainte may convert the outstanding principal and interest on the loan into shares of our common stock. The number of shares to be issued on conversion will be determined by dividing the average closing price of our common stock (which in no case can be greater than $0.45) for the ten trading days preceding the conversion date by the outstanding principal and interest on the loan on the conversion date. 
   
 On July 5, 2016, we borrowed $50,000 from Slainte Ventures and used the proceeds for working capital purposes. The loan, together with interest at 12% per year, is payable on December 30, 2016. We can prepay the loan at any time. If the loan is repaid on or before September 30, 2016, the principal amount which is being repaid will increase by 10%. If the loan is repaid after September 30, 2016, the principal amount which is being repaid will increase by 15%. The amount of the principal increase may be paid with shares of our common stock. The number of shares to be issued for such purpose will be determined by dividing the average closing price of our common stock (which in no case can be greater than $0.45) for the ten trading days preceding the prepayment date. If the loan is not paid when due, then at any time on or before January 10, 2017, Slainte may convert the outstanding principal and interest on the loan into shares of our common stock. The number of shares to be issued on conversion will be determined by dividing the average closing price of our common stock (which in no case can be greater than $0.45) for the ten trading days preceding the conversion date by the outstanding principal and interest on the loan on the conversion date.

JSJ Convertible Note   
   
 On August 10, 2016, we borrowed $125,000 from JSJ Investments and used the proceeds for working capital purposes. The loan, together with interest at 12% per year, is payable on May 10, 2017. We can prepay the loan at any time. If the loan is repaid on or before October 16, the principal amount which is being repaid will increase by 25%. If the loan is repaid on or before October 16, 2016 through February 12, 2016, the principal amount which is being repaid will increase by 30%. Thereafter, the note may be repaid only upon written consent from JSJ, and the principal amount that is being repaid will increase by 30%. At any time after the date of the note, JSJ is entitled to convert all of the outstanding and unpaid principal in to shares of our common stock. Until February 12, 2017, the conversion price is $0.20 per share, and thereafter, the conversion price will be at a 45% discount to the lowest closing price of our common stock for the ten trading days preceding the conversion date. JSJ may not make any conversions that would result in the note holder holding more than 4.99% of our issued and outstanding common stock at any one time. 
   
  NOTE 13   STOCKHOLDERS  DEFICIT  
   
   Stock Options   
   
 On January 9, 2015, we awarded 200,000 stock options to each of Messrs. Blackmon, Verzura and Ruby under our 2014 Stock Incentive Plan. The options were fully vested at the time of grant and give the option holder the right to purchase shares of our common stock at $0.70 per share during the ten year term of the option. 
   
 We calculated the fair value of each option to be approximately $0.70 per option utilizing the Black Scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions on the date of valuation: 

At December 31, 2015, the fair value of these 600,000 options totaling $417,664 was included in accrued expenses on our condensed consolidated balance sheets and on January 9, 2015, the option grant date, we increased common stock and decreased accrued expenses by this amount to account for the issuance of these options on that date. 
   
 On January 12, 2016, we awarded 1,050,000 stock options to each of Messrs. Blackmon, Verzura and 980,000 stock potions to Mr. Ruby under our 2014 Stock Incentive Plan. The options were fully vested at the time of grant and give the option holder the right to purchase shares of our common stock at $0.20 per share during the ten year term of the option. 
   
 We calculated the fair value of each option to be approximately $0.20 per option utilizing the Black Scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions on the date of valuation: 

At December 31, 2015, the fair value of 3,080,000 options totaling $612,512, was included in accrued expenses on our condensed consolidated balance sheets, and on January 15, 2016, the option grant date, we increased common stock and decreased accrued expenses by this amount to account for the issuance of these options on that date.

Common Stock Issued In Exchange For Outstanding Warrant   
   
 On February 10, 2015, we issued 621,000 shares of our common stock valued at $987,390 based on the previous day s closing price, to Typenex Co-Investment, LLC ( Typenex ) in exchange for the return of Warrant #1 to Purchase Shares of Common Stock (the  Warrant ) that we issued to Typenex on August 13, 2014, as part of a financing arrangement. We calculated the fair value of the Warrant to be $218,788, or approximately $1.29 per underlying share, utilizing the Black Scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions on the date of valuation: 

The Warrant gave Typenex the right to purchase 170,044 shares of our common stock on the issuance date and provided for adjustments to the number of shares underlying the Warrant upon occurrence of certain events including subsequent sales of our common stock. Our repurchase of the Warrant resulted in Typenex forgoing its potential right to receive shares in excess of the original 170,044 shares underlying the Warrant on the original issuance date. On February 10, 2015, we recorded the $768,602 fair value of the common shares issued in excess of the $218,788 fair value of the Warrant reacquired as a loss on settlement of disputed terms of warrant in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and as an increase in common stock on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.

ITEM 2.  
  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.    
   
 We were originally formed on November 15, 2007 as a California corporation under the name MySkin, Inc.  MySkin was engaged in the business of providing management services to a medical spa in Los Angeles, California which provided various advanced skin care services until March 31, 2014, when this business was sold to the former President of the Company. 
   
 In early 2014 we decided to exit the medical spa management business and change our focus to creating unique products which can be used to treat a wide range of diseases that can be used by patients globally.  Our products are subject to all existing marijuana laws in the United States. 
   
 We own intellectual property relating to the legalized growth, production, manufacture, marketing, management, utilization and distribution of medical and recreational marijuana and marijuana infused products.   We have entered into what we believe are significant agreements with partners outside of Colorado where we have agreed to provide intellectual property and consulting services. We also have formalized strategic relationships with four other businesses in the marijuana industry. 
   
 Our primary goal is to advance the use of phytocannabinoids therapeutics in medicine through research, product development and education. We are dedicated to improving the lives of patients. We provide the intellectual property, patent-pending technology, trusted brands, clinical data, technical training, sales tools and methodologies necessary to assist our clients businesses for success.  Our ACT Now Program utilizes our patent-pending Prana Bio Nutrient Medicinals with a HIPPAA compliant electronic health record ( EHR ) software that enables physicians to create comprehensive sequencing charts specific to their patients  medical aliments. The ACT Now EHR software allows for global monitoring, patient management, and effective cannabinoid therapy protocols. 
   
 Our Prana Bio Nutrient Medicinal products are designed to help supplement deficiencies related to the endocannabinoid system including pain, neuropathy, arthritis, MS, IBS, autism, seizures, eczema, sleep, anxiety, head trauma, opioid dependency and clinical endocannabinoid deficiencies. The endocannabinoid system is a signaling system within the human body that utilizes hundreds of receptors to help maintain homeostasis between the central nervous system and the immune system. 
   
 Our Prana Aromatherapy Transdermal Roll-on line uses a proprietary blend of essential oils infused with cannabinoids designed to provide targeted and large surface relief with combinations of aromatherapy. The transdermal is a part of the complete patent-pending Prana Bio Nutrient Medicinals line, which is offered in 5 categories (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5), with three delivery methods (sublingual, capsules, topical). Dosages range from 1mg to 50mg, are available in both raw and activated formulations, and paired with specific cannabis derived terpene profiles. 
   
 Our short term plan involves licensing the technology associated with our products to companies which are licensed to grow and sell medical marijuana in states where medical marijuana is legal.  As of July 31, 2016 we had signed license agreements with two companies. 
   
 Our long term plan is to perform clinical trials on the most promising products in our product line that are currently being manufactured in California. . We intend to perform our phase I clinical trials at the West Indies University in Jamaica.   We will fund the initial clinical trials by licensing our Prana product line to manufacturers in all legal territories in the United States and with revenue received for providing technical, financial and licensing consulting services. After our phase 1 clinical trials are complete, we plan on partnering with companies that have expertise in global pharmaceutical distribution and research for phase II and III clinical trials in the United States.

   I 
     
   An increase resulting from the recognition of $200,000 of deferred revenue associated with the FoxBarry transaction, described in Note 10 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, coupled with a decrease from the three months ended September 30, 2015 of approximately $68,000 in consulting revenues and licensing fees.

   Lower amounts spent on sales and marketing, research and development, and salaries and wages. 

Material changes in line items in our Statement of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period last year, are discussed below: 

Increase (I) or  
            
    Item  
         Decrease (D)  
         Reason  

Revenues 
        I 
        License fee income increased approximately $343,000 largely due to a major dispensary in California aggressively selling our licensed products, plus the recognition of $200,000 of deferred consulting fee revenue associated with the FoxBarry transaction, described in Note 10 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The increase in license fee income and deferred consulting fee revenue was mitigated by a one-time gain on the sale of certain non-cannabis related raw materials for $200,000 in the prior period, and a decrease from the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of approximately $171,000 in consulting revenues. 
  
   Gross profit, as a % of revenue 
        D 
        Slight decrease due to greater licensing fees than consulting fees compared to the prior period. Our licensing fees have a higher cost to deliver than our consulting fees, which resulted in a lower profit margin due to our product mix for the period. 
  
   General and Administrative expenses 
        D 
        Lower amounts spent on sales and marketing, research and development, and salaries and wages. 

The factors that will most significantly affect future operating results will be: 

State by state regulatory changes in the United States; 

The aftermath of the recent elections; and 

Rescheduling of marijuana by the federal government. 

Capital Resources and Liquidity  
   
 Our material sources and (uses) of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were: 

20 

General  
   
 Other than the repayment of our notes and convertible notes, we presently have no material capital commitments for the twelve months ending September 30, 2017. 
   
 Other than as disclosed above, we do not know of any: 

trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in, or that are reasonable likely to result in, our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way; or 

any significant changes in our expected sources and uses of cash. 

We do not have any commitments or arrangements from any person to provide us with any equity capital. 
   
 During the next twelve months, we anticipate that we will incur approximately $832,000 of general and administrative expenses in order to execute our current business plan. We also expect to incur significant sales, marketing, research and development expenses during the next twelve months. We must obtain additional financing to continue our operations. We may not be able to obtain additional funding on terms that are favorable to us or at all. We may not be able to obtain sufficient funding to continue our operations, or if we do receive funding, to generate adequate revenues in the future or to operate profitably. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
     
 None. 
   
  Significant Accounting Policies  
   
 See Note 2 to the financial statements included as part of this report for a description of our significant accounting policies. 
   
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
   
 From time to time, the FASB or other standards setting bodies issue new accounting pronouncements. Updates to the FASB ASCs are communicated through issuance of an Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ). Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued guidance, whether adopted or to be adopted in the future, is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 
   
 To understand the impact of recently issued guidance, whether adopted or to be adopted, please review the information provided in Note 2 to   the financial statements included as part of this Report. 
   
  ITEM 4.  
  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.    
   
 An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive and Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report on Form 10-Q. Disclosure controls and procedures are procedures designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, such as this Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and is communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
   
  Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
   
 Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 
   
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter covered by this report that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
