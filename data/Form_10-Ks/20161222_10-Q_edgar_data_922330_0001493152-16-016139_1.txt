NOTE
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

The
accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of REGI U.S., Inc. ( REGI ) have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended April 30, 2016 filed
on Form 10-K with the SEC. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements
reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position and the
results of operations for the interim period presented herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or for any future period. Notes to the unaudited consolidated financial
statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited consolidated financial statements for
fiscal 2016 as reported in Form 10-K, have been omitted.  

Property,
plant and equipment     

Property
and equipment are stated at cost, which includes the acquisition price and any direct costs to bring the asset into use at its
intended location, less accumulated amortization.  

Amortization
of property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method to write off the cost, net of any estimated residual value,
over their estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: Office equipment 5 years. Amortization of office equipment is included
in general and administrative expenses.  

NOTE
2. GOING CONCERN   

REGI
incurred net losses of $371,562 for the six months ended October 31, 2016 and has a working capital deficit of $2,076,583 and
an accumulated deficit of $13,322,094 at October 31, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of REGI to
continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty. As a result, REGI s unaudited consolidated financial statements as of October 31, 2016 and for the
six months ended have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement
of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.  

REGI
also receives interim support from affiliated companies and plans to raise additional capital through debt and/or equity financings.
There continues to be insufficient funds to provide enough working capital to fund ongoing operations for the next twelve months.
REGI may also raise additional funds through the exercise of warrants and stock options, if exercised. There is no assurance that
any of these activities will be successful.  

NOTE
3. RELATED PARTIES   

Amounts
due from related parties are unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand. Related parties consist of the directors and officers
and a former director of REGI and companies controlled or significantly influenced by these parties. As of October 31, 2016, there
was $1,881,716 due to related parties. As of April 30, 2016, there was $1,916,876 due to related parties.  

During
the six month period ended October 31, 2015, the former President and CEO of REGI provided consulting services to REGI valued
at $45,000, which were accounted for as donated capital and charged to expense during the period. $Nil was recorded in the six
month period ended October 31, 2016.  

During
the six month period ended October 31, 2015, the CFO of REGI provided consulting services to REGI valued at $15,000, which were
accounted for as donated capital and charged to expense during the period. $Nil was recorded in the six month period ended October
31, 2016.  

During
the six month period ended October 31, 2016, the the CEO advanced $95,633 to the Company, of which $11,827 was for the purchase
of the office furniture. During the six months ended October 31, 2016 the CEO was repaid $46,000, of which $30,000 was with the
issuance of secured convertible promissory notes.   

During
the six month period ended October 31, 2016, the the Chief Engineer who is also a director of the Company advanced $19,094 to
the Company, of which $4,848 was for the purchase of the office equipment. During the six months ended October 31, 2016 the Chief
Engineer was repaid $41,517 for balance owed to him, of which $15,152 was with the issuance of secured convertible promissory
notes.

with common director with the Company. The promissory note bears interest rate of 6% per annum, is unsecured and due on demand.
During the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, there was no change to the principal amount of the promissory note and
interest expense of $720 was recorded each year. The principal balance of the note is included as due to related parties in the
consolidated balance sheets.  

NOTE
4. GAIN ON DEBT SETTLEMENT   

During
the six months ended October 31, 2016 the Company recorded gain on debt settlement of $666 with a service provider.  

NOTE
5. SECURED CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES   

During
the six months ended October 31, 2016, the Company issued senior secured convertible promissory notes (the  Convertible
Notes ) for total proceeds of $205,152. The Convertible Notes are secured against all assets of the Company, repayable two
years after the issuance, bearing simple interest rate of 10% during the term of the notes and simple interest rate of 20% after
the due date, and convertible at any time on or after ninety days from the issuance date into the Company s common stocks
at $0.10 per share.  

The
Company analyzed the conversion option in the notes for derivative accounting treatment under ASC Topic 815,  Derivatives
and Hedging,  and determined that the instrument does not qualify for derivative accounting.  

The
Company therefore performed an analysis to determine if the conversion option was subject to a beneficial conversion feature and
determined that the instrument does not have a beneficial conversion feature.  

NOTE
6. STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY   

a)
Common Stock Options and Warrants  

On
August 12, 2016, REGI granted an aggregate of 3,700,000 common stock options for services. These options vest upon grant, expire
on July 20, 2021 and are exercisable at the following prices:  

The
fair value of the options was determined to be $216,088 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires management
to make estimates that are subjective and may not be representative of the actual results. Changes in assumptions can materially
affect estimates of fair value. The following assumptions were used for the calculation: risk free interest rate 1.16% expected
life (in years) 4.94 expected volatility 228.65% and expected dividend yield 0.0%.  

A
summary of REGI s stock option activity for the six months ended October 31, 2016 is as follows:  

At
October 31, 2016, the Company had $266,707 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options and warrants,
which will be recognized over future periods. The intrinsic value of  in the money  exercisable options at October
31, 2016 was $Nil.  

A
summary of REGI s common stock warrant activity for the six months ended October 31, 2016 is as follows:  

At
October 31, 2016, the exercise price and the weighted average remaining contractual life of the outstanding warrants was $0.25
per share and 0.60 year, respectively. The intrinsic value of  in the money  exercisable warrants at October 31, 2016
was $Nil.  

NOTE
7. COMMITMENTS

University Research Corporation ( WVURC ), the grantors have agreed that WVURC shall own 5% of all patented technology

NOTE
8. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Exchange approval.  

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   

Forward-Looking Statements   

Certain
statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q constitute  forward-looking statements.  These statements,
identified by words such as  plan,   anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   should, 
 expect  and similar expressions include our expectations and objectives regarding our future financial position,
operating results and business strategy. These statements reflect the current views of management with respect to future events
and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements, or industry
results, to be materially different from those described in the forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include
those set forth in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016. We do not intend to update the forward- looking information
to reflect actual results or changes in the factors affecting such forward-looking information. We advise you to carefully review
the reports and documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ), particularly
our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our Current Reports on Form 8-K.  

All
dollar amounts in this Quarterly Report are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated.  

Nature
of Business  

We
are a development stage company engaged in the business of developing and building an improved axial vane-type rotary engine known
as the RadMax  rotary technology (the  RadMax  Engine ), used in the design of lightweight and high efficiency
engines, compressors and pumps. The worldwide intellectual and marketing rights to the RadMax  Engine, exclusive of the
United States, are held by Reg Technologies Inc. ( Reg Tech ). The Company owns the U.S. marketing and intellectual
rights and has a project cost sharing agreement, whereby it funds 50% of the further development of the RadMax  Engine and
Reg Tech funds 50%.  

Reg
Tech is a public company listed for trading on the TSX Venture Exchange and on OTC.BB. Reg Tech holds approximately 10.17% of
our issued and outstanding shares.  

Recent
Development   

Effective
September 16, 2016 the Company executed Asset Purchase Agreement with Reg Tech to purchase all of Reg Tech s assets. The
consideration for the purchase is one   one tenth (1.1) shares of REGI U.S., Inc. for each one (1) share of Reg Technologies,
Inc. for a total of 50,929,388 shares of REGI U.S.. These shares were issued in December, 2016 after Reg Technologies obtained
shareholder approval by special resolution at a special meeting of the shareholders on November 18, 2016.. The transaction is
subject to TSX Venture Exchange approval.  

Going
Concern  

We
incurred net losses of $371,562 for the six months ended October 31, 2016, has a working capital deficit of $2,076,583 and an
accumulated deficit of $13,322,094 at October 31, 2016. Further losses are expected until we enter into a licensing agreement
with a manufacturer and reseller. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going
concern.  

We
may receive interim support from affiliated companies and plan to raise additional capital through debt and/or equity financings.
We may also raise additional funds through the exercise of warrants and stock options, if exercised. However, there is no assurance
that any of these activities will be successful.  

Due
to the uncertainty of our ability to generate sufficient revenues from our operating activities and/or to obtain the necessary
financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due, in their
report on our financial statements for the year ended April 30, 2016, our registered independent auditors included additional
comments indicating concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements contain additional note
disclosures describing the circumstances that led to this disclosure by our registered independent auditors. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

Results
of Operations for Six Months Ended October 31, 2016 Compared to the Six Months Ended October 31, 2015  

We
had a net loss of $371,562 during the six months ended October 31, 2016, increased from net loss of $180,665 during the six months
ended October 31, 2015.  

Research
and development expenses increased from $46,345 in three months ended October 31, 2015 to $71,716 in six months ended October
31, 2016, as more funds were available in the current period.  

Total
general and administrative expenses increased from $133,600 in the six months ended October 31, 2015 to $296,752 in the six months
ended October 31, 2016.   

General
and administrative expense comparisons are as follows:  

During
each of the six months ended October 31, 2015 and 2016 we recorded interest expense of $720 on the same promissory note issued
to a related party.  

During
the six months ended October 31, 2016 we recorded interest expense of $3,040 on secured convertible promissory notes; during the
six months ended October 31, 2015 we did not have such debt instrument or incur related interest expense.  

We
have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue exploration activities. For these
reasons our auditors believe that there is substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern.  

Results
of Operations for Three Months Ended October 31, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended October 31, 2015  

We
had a net loss of $360,647 during the three months ended October 31, 2016, increased from net loss of $81,251 during the three
months ended October 31, 2015.  

Research
and development expenses increased from $12,578 in three months ended October 31, 2015 to $71,716 in three months ended October
31, 2016, as we raised more funds in the current period.  

Total
general and administrative expenses increased from $80,891 in three months ended October 31, 2015 to $357,247 in the three months
ended October 31, 2016.   

General
and administrative expense comparisons are as follows:  

During
each of the three months ended October 31, 2015 and 2016 we recorded interest expense of $360 on the same promissory note issued
to a related party.  

During
the three months ended October 31, 2016 we recorded interest expense of $3,040 on secured convertible promissory notes; during
the three months ended October 31, 2015 we did not have such debt instrument or incur related interest expense.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources  

During
the three months ended October 31, 2016, we financed our operations mainly through advances from related parties of $27,210 and
with proceeds of $205,152 from issuance of secured convertible promissory notes.  

At
October 31, 2016 total amount owing to related parties is $1,881,716 or 90.29% of total liabilities as of October 31, 2016. This
funding was necessary with a downturn in the financial market to complete the RadMax  Engine and place us in a position
to attain profit. The balances owing to related parties are non-interest bearing, unsecured and repayable on demand. Our affiliated
companies have indicated that they will not be demanding repayment of these funds during the next fiscal year.  

During
November, 2016 we raised $38,000 by issuing secured convertible promissory notes. See Item 2 of Part II to this report.   

We
plan to raise additional capital through debt and/or equity financings. We cannot provide any assurance that additional funding
will be available to finance our operations on acceptable terms in order to enable us to complete our plan of operations. There
are no assurances that we will be able to achieve further sales of our common stock or any other form of additional financing.
If we are unable to achieve the financing necessary to continue our plan of operations, then we will not be able to continue the
development of our RadMax  Engine and our business will fail.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements  

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources that is material to our stockholders.  

Critical
Accounting Policies  

We
have identified certain accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of our current financial condition and results
of operations. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements for the three
months ended October 31, 2016, attached hereto.  

Contractual
Obligations  

We
do not currently have any contractual obligations requiring any payment obligation from us.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934  and are not required to
provide the information under this item.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures   

(a)
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   

Based
upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures performed by our management, with participation
of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer as of the end of the period covered by this report, our Chief Executive
Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to inadequate
segregation of duties.  

As
used herein,   disclosure controls and procedures   mean controls and other procedures of our company that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules
and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

We
are taking steps to enhance and improve the design of our disclosure controls. During the period covered by this interim report,
we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we need to appoint
additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties, and adopt sufficient written policies and procedures
for accounting and financial reporting. These remediation efforts are largely dependent upon securing additional financing to
cover the costs of implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may be
adversely affected.  

(b)
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended October 31, 2016 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
