   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
  (unaudited)  
     
  1.         ORGANIZATION 
     
  ML BlueTrend FuturesAccess LLC (the  Fund ), a  FuturesAccess  SM  Program ( FuturesAccess ) fund, which is an investment company as defined by Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) guidance, was organized under the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act on April 30, 2008 and commenced trading activities on September 1, 2008. The Fund engages in the speculative trading of futures and forward contracts on a wide range of commodities. Systematica Investments Limited (acting as general partner of Systematica Investments LP) ( Trading Advisor ) is the trading advisor of the Fund. The Trading Advisor trades the BlueTrend Program (the  Trading Program ) for the Fund. The Trading Advisor has delegated the day-to-day operation of the Trading Program to affiliated sub-investment managers, Systematica Investments GP Limited and Systematica Investments Singapore Pte. Ltd. and may in the future delegate to other affiliated sub-investment managers. 
     
  Merrill Lynch Alternative Investments LLC ( MLAI , the  Sponsor  or the  Managing Member ) is the sponsor and manager of the Fund. MLAI is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation. Bank of America Corporation and its affiliates are referred to herein as  BofA Corp. . Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner   Smith Incorporated ( MLPF S ) is currently the exclusive clearing broker for the Fund. MLAI may select other parties as clearing broker(s). Merrill Lynch International ( MLI ) is the primary foreign exchange ( F/X ) forward prime broker for the Fund. MLAI may select other of its affiliates, or third parties, as F/X or other over-the-counter ( OTC ) prime brokers. MLPF S and MLI are BofA Corp. affiliates.  
     
  FuturesAccess is a group of managed futures funds sponsored by MLAI ( FuturesAccess Funds ).  FuturesAccess is exclusively available to investors that have investment accounts with Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, U.S. Trust and other divisions or affiliates of BofA Corp.  FuturesAccess Funds currently are composed of direct-trading funds advised by a single trading advisor. Although redemption terms vary among FuturesAccess Funds, FuturesAccess applies, with some exceptions, the same minimum investment amounts, fees and other operational criteria across all FuturesAccess Funds.  Each trading advisor participating in FuturesAccess employs different technical, fundamental, systematic and/or discretionary trading strategies.  
     
  Interests in the Fund are not insured or otherwise protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government authority. Interests are not deposits or other obligations of, and are not guaranteed by, BofA Corp. or by any bank.  Interests are subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of the full amount invested.  
     
  The Fund considers all highly liquid investments, with a maturity of three months or less when acquired, to be cash equivalents classified as Level II within the fair value hierarchy discussed in Note 3. As of September 30, 2016, the Fund holds cash equivalents.  Cash was held at a nationally recognized financial institution.  
     
 9   

In the opinion of management, these interim financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the financial position of the Fund as of  September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and the results of its operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  However, the operating results for the interim periods may not be indicative of the results for the full year.  
     
  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) have been omitted.  These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Fund s report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
     
   Estimates   
     
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences could be material.  
     
 10   

2.                 CONDENSED SCHEDULES OF INVESTMENTS 
     
  The Fund s investments, defined as unrealized profit (loss) on open contracts on the Statements of Financial Condition, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, are as follows:  
     
    September 30, 2016    

December 31, 2015    

*Currencies-Forwards present notional amounts as converted to USD.  
     
  No individual contract s unrealized profit or loss comprised greater than 5% of Members  Capital as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. With respect to each commodity industry sector listed in the above chart, the net unrealized profit (loss) on open positions is the sum of the unrealized profits (losses) of long positions and short positions, netting unrealized losses against unrealized profits as applicable.  Net unrealized profit and loss provides a rough measure of the exposure of the Fund to the various sectors as of the date listed, although such exposure can change at any time.  
     
 11   

3. FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENTS  
     
  Fair value of an investment is the amount that would be received to sell the investment in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (i.e. the exit price). All investments (including derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments) are held for trading purposes.  The investments are recorded on trade date and open contracts are recorded at fair value (described below) at the measurement date. Investments denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at the measurement date.  Profits or losses are realized when contracts are liquidated.  Unrealized profits or losses on open contracts are included in Equity in commodity trading accounts on the Statements of Financial Condition.  Any change in net unrealized profit or loss from the preceding period/year is reported in the respective Statements of Operations.  
     
  The fair value measurement guidance established by U.S. GAAP is a hierarchical disclosure framework which prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring investments at fair value. Market price observability is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of investment and the characteristics specific to the investment. Investments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair value.  
     
  Investments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:  
     
  Level I   Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical investments as of the reporting date. The type of investments included in Level I are publicly traded investments. As required by the fair market value measurement guidance in U.S. GAAP, the Fund does not adjust the quoted price for these investments even in situations where the Fund holds a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price.  
     
  Level II   Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date, and fair value is determined through the use of generally accepted and understood models or other valuation methodologies. Investments which are generally included in this category are investments valued using market data.  
     
  Level III   Pricing inputs are unobservable and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment. Fair value for these investments is determined using valuation methodologies that consider a range of factors, including but not limited to the nature of the investment, local market conditions, trading values on public exchanges for comparable securities, current and projected operating performance and financing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investment. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment. Due to the inherent uncertainty of these estimates, these values may differ materially from the values that would have been used had a ready market for these investments existed.  
     
  In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an investment s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. MLAI s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the investment.  
     
  The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for investments, as well as the general classification of such investments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.  
     
 12   

Exchange traded investments are fair valued by the Fund by using the reported closing price on the primary exchange where such investments are traded.  These closing prices are observed through the clearing broker and third party pricing services. For non-exchange traded investments, quoted values and other data provided by nationally recognized independent pricing sources are used as inputs into the process for determining fair values.  
     
  The Fund has determined that Level I investments would include its futures and options contracts where it believes that quoted prices are available in an active market.  
     
  Where the Fund believes that quoted market prices are not available or that the market is not active, fair values are estimated by using observable prices of investments with similar characteristics and these are generally classified as Level II investments. The Fund determined that Level II investments would include its forwards and certain futures contracts.  
     
  Transfers of investments between different levels of the fair value hierarchy, if any, are recorded as of the beginning of the reporting period. There were no transfers to or from any level during the three month or nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 or the year ended December 31, 2015.  
     
  The Fund s unrealized profit (loss) on open forwards and futures contracts, by the above fair value hierarchy levels, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, are as follows:  

13   

The Fund s volume of trading forwards and futures as of the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 and year ended December 31, 2015 are representative of the activity throughout these periods.  
     
  The Fund engages in the speculative trading of futures, options on futures and forward contracts on a wide range of commodities. Such contracts meet the definition of a derivative as noted in the ASC guidance for accounting for derivative and hedging activities. The fair value amounts of, and the net profits and losses on, derivative instruments are disclosed in the Statements of Financial Condition and Statements of Operations, respectively. There are no credit related contingent features embedded in these derivative contracts. The total notional, number of contracts and fair values of derivative instruments by contract type/commodity sector are disclosed in Note 2.  
     
  The Fund maintains margin deposits and cash collateral with its futures and forwards brokers, respectively, based on the greater of exchange margin or amounts determined by the respective broker. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the initial margin deposits (cash) are used to satisfy the margin requirements to establish the futures or forward contracts and are presented on the Statements of Financial Condition in Cash in the Equity in commodity trading accounts. The variation margin on open contracts is presented gross on the Statements of Financial Condition in Unrealized profit or loss on futures or forwards contracts, respectively. The Fund is subject to agreements which support the ability to settle net with its counterparties; however, the Fund has elected to present the related balances on the Statements of Financial Condition on a gross basis. The net of these amounts plus the restricted cash presented within the Cash in the Equity in commodity trading accounts on the Statements of Financial Condition represents the Fund s net exposure.  
     
  The following table indicates the trading profits and losses before brokerage commissions, by commodity industry sector for each of the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  
     
 14   

The Fund is subject to the risk of insolvency of a counterparty, an exchange, a clearinghouse, MLPF S or other BofA Corp. entities.  Fund assets could be lost or impounded during lengthy bankruptcy proceedings.  Were a substantial portion of the Fund s capital tied up in a bankruptcy or other similar types of proceedings, MLAI might suspend or limit trading, perhaps causing the Fund to miss significant profit opportunities.  There are increased risks in dealing with unregulated trading counterparties including the risk that assets may not benefit from the protection afforded to  customer funds  deposited with regulated dealers and brokers.  
     
  4.  MARKET AND CREDIT RISKS  
     
  The nature of this Fund has certain risks, which cannot all be presented in the financial statements.  The following summarizes some of those risks.  
     
   Market Risk   
     
  Derivative instruments involve varying degrees of market risk.  Changes in the level or volatility of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates or the market values of the financial instruments or commodities underlying such derivative instruments frequently result in changes in the Fund s unrealized profit (loss) on open contracts on such derivative instruments as reflected in the Statements of Financial Condition.  The Fund s exposure to market risk is influenced by a number of factors, including the relationships among the derivative instruments held by the Fund as well as the volatility and liquidity of the markets in which the derivative instruments are traded.  Investments in foreign markets may also entail legal and political risks.  
     
 15   

MLAI has procedures in place intended to control market risk exposure, although there can be no assurance that it will, in fact, succeed in doing so.  These procedures focus primarily on monitoring the trading of the Trading Advisor, calculating the Net Asset Value of the Fund as of the close of business on each day and reviewing outstanding positions for over-concentrations.  While MLAI does not intervene in the markets to hedge or diversify the Fund s market exposure, MLAI may urge the Trading Advisor to reallocate positions in an attempt to avoid over-concentrations.  However, such interventions are expected to be unusual.  It is expected that MLAI s basic risk control procedures will consist of the process of Trading Advisor monitoring, with the market risk controls being applied by the Trading Advisor.  
     
   Credit Risk   
     
  The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are typically perceived to be less than those associated with over-the-counter (non-exchange-traded) transactions because exchanges typically (but not universally) provide clearinghouse arrangements in which the collective credit (in some cases limited in amount, in some cases not) of the members of the exchange/clearinghouse is pledged to support the financial integrity of the exchange/clearinghouse.  In over-the-counter transactions, on the other hand, traders must rely solely on the credit of their respective individual counterparties.  Margins, which may be subject to loss in the event of a default, are generally required in exchange traded contracts, and in the over-the-counter markets counterparties may also require margin. The credit risk associated with these instruments from counterparty nonperformance is the unrealized profit (loss) on open contracts, if any, included in the Statements of Financial Condition.  
     
  MLAI, as sponsor of the Fund, has a general policy of maintaining clearing and prime brokerage arrangements with BofA Corp. affiliates, such as MLPF S and MLI, although MLAI may engage non-BofA Corp. affiliated service providers as clearing brokers or prime brokers for the Fund. This policy may increase risk to the Fund by preventing the diversification of brokers used by the Fund.  
     
  The Fund, in its normal course of business, enters into various contracts, with MLPF S acting as its futures clearing broker and MLI as its forwards prime broker.  Due to the relationship with MLPF S, in the event of default, all futures balances are eligible for offset with a net settlement due to MLPF S. Due to the relationship with MLI, in the event of default, all forwards balances are eligible for offset with a net settlement due to MLI.  
     
   Indemnifications   
     
  In the normal course of business the Fund has entered, or may in the future, enter into agreements that obligate the Fund to indemnify certain parties, including BofA Corp. affiliates. No claims have actually been made with respect to such indemnities and any quantification would involve hypothetical claims that have not been made. Based on the Fund s experience, MLAI expects the risk of loss to be remote and, therefore, no provision has been recorded.  
     
  5.    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  
     
  MLAI owns 100 Class D Units which represent less than 1% of the Fund s Net Asset Value as of September 30, 2016.  
     
 16   

MLAI, the Fund and certain other FuturesAccess Funds, MLAI s HedgeAccess     Program of  hedge funds and other BofA Corp. funds (each a  Serviced Fund  and collectively, the  Serviced Funds ) have entered into a transfer agency and investor services agreement with Financial Data Services, Inc. (the  Transfer Agent ), a wholly owned subsidiary of BofA Corp. and affiliate of MLAI.  The Transfer Agent provides registrar, distribution disbursing agent, transfer agent and certain other services related to the issuance, redemption, exchange and transfer of Units.  The fees charged by the Transfer Agent for its services were 0.02% per year of the aggregate net assets of the Serviced Funds. The fee is paid monthly in arrears.  The Transfer Agent also receives reimbursement for its out-of-pocket expenses and certain extraordinary expenses.  MLAI allocates the Transfer Agent fees to each of the Serviced Funds, including the Fund, on a monthly basis based on each Serviced Fund s net assets. The Transfer Agent fee allocated to the Fund for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016, and 2015 amounted to $973 and $5,600. The Transfer Agent fee allocated to the Fund for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, and 2015 amounted to $4,111 and  $23,461, respectively, of which $1,294 and $2,507 was payable to the Transfer Agent as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
     
  Brokerage commissions, interest, net and Sponsor fees, as presented on the Statements of Operations, are all received from or paid to related parties. Equity in commodity trading accounts, including cash and Unrealized profit (loss), as presented on the Statements of Financial Condition are held with a related party.  
     
  6.   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  
     
  Management has evaluated the impact of subsequent events on the Fund through the date the financial statements were issued and has determined that there were no subsequent events that require adjustments to, or disclosure in, the financial statements.  
     
  Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  
     
  PERIOD-END NET ASSET VALUE PER UNIT  
     
  The Fund calculates the Net Asset Value per Unit of each Class of Units as of the last calendar day of each month and as of any other dates MLAI may determine in its discretion (each, a  Calculation Date ). The Fund s Net Asset Value as of any Calculation Date generally equals the value of the Fund s account under the management of the Trading Advisor as of that date, plus any other assets held by the Fund, minus accrued Sponsor, management and performance fees, trading liabilities, including brokerage commissions, any offering or operating costs, and all other liabilities of the Fund. MLAI or its delegates are authorized to make all Net Asset Value determinations.  
     
  MLAI believes that the Net Asset Value used to calculate subscription and redemption value and to    report performance to investors is a useful performance measure for the investors of the Fund. Therefore, the charts below are referencing Net Asset Value at each Calculation Date.  
     
 17   

PERIOD-END NET ASSET VALUE PER INITIAL UNIT CLASS A  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
     
  The Fund borrows only to a limited extent and only on a strictly short-term basis in order to finance losses on non-U.S. dollar denominated trading positions pending the conversion of the Fund s U.S. dollar deposits.  These borrowings are at a prevailing short-term rate in the relevant currency.  
     
  Substantially all of the Fund s assets are held in cash with the brokers. Changes in interest rates could cause periods of strong up or down price trends, during which the Fund s profit or loss potential might increase. Inflation in commodity prices could also generate price movements, which the strategies might successfully follow. The Fund should be able to close out its open trading positions and liquidate its holdings relatively quickly and at market prices, except in unusual circumstances.  This typically permits the Fund to limit losses as well as reduce market exposure on short notice should its strategies indicate doing so.  
     
 18   

As a commodity pool, the Fund maintains an extremely large percentage of its assets in cash, which it must have available to post initial and variation margin on futures contracts.  This cash is also used to fund redemptions.  While the Fund has the ability to fund redemption proceeds from liquidating positions, as a practical matter positions are not liquidated to fund redemptions.  In the event that positions were liquidated to fund redemptions, MLAI, as the manager of the Fund, has the ability to override decisions of the Trading Advisor to fund redemptions if necessary, but in practice the Trading Advisor would determine in its discretion which investments should be liquidated.  
     
   For the nine month period ended September 30 , 2016, Fund capital decreased 34.78% from $33,879,085 to $22,095,549.  This decrease was attributable to the net loss from operations of $2,450,457, coupled with the redemption of 9,365,910 redeemable Units resulting in an outflow of $9,634,946.  The cash outflow was offset with cash inflow of $301,867 due to subscriptions of 293,427 Units.  Future redemptions could impact the amount of funds available for investment in commodity contract positions in subsequent months.  
     
  Critical Accounting Policies  
     
  Statement of Cash Flows  
     
  The Fund is not required to provide a Statement of Cash Flows.  
     
  Investments  
     
  All investments (including derivatives) are held for trading purposes.  Investments are recorded on trade date and open contracts are recorded at fair value (as described below) at the measurement date.  Investments denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at the measurement date.  Profits or losses are realized when contracts are liquidated.  Unrealized profits or losses on open contracts are included as a component of equity in commodity trading accounts on the Statements of Financial Condition.  Realized profits or losses and any change in net unrealized profits or losses from the preceding period are reported in the Statements of Operations.  
     
  Fair Value Measurements  
     
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  For more information on the Fund s treatment of fair value, see Financial Statements Note 3, Fair Value of Investments.  
     
  Futures Contracts  
     
  The Fund trades exchange listed futures contracts.  A listed futures contract is a firm commitment to buy or sell a standardized quantity of an underlying asset over a specified duration.  The Fund buys and sells contracts based on indices of financial assets such as stocks, domestic and global stock indices, as well as contracts on various physical commodities. Prices paid or received on these contracts are determined by the ask or bid provided by the exchanges on which they are traded.   Contracts may be settled in physical form or cash settled depending upon the contract.  Upon the execution of a trade, margin requirements determine the amount of cash that must be on deposit to secure the transaction.  These amounts are considered restricted cash on the Fund s Statements of Financial Condition.  Contracts are priced daily by the Fund and the profit or loss is based on the daily mark to market and is recorded as unrealized profit (loss).  When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized profit or loss equal to the  
     
 19   

difference between the value of the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed.  Because transactions in futures contracts require participants to make both initial margin deposits of cash or other assets and variation margin deposits, through the futures broker or directly with the exchange on which the contracts are traded, credit exposure is limited.  Realized profit (loss), net and change in unrealized profit (loss), net on futures contracts are recognized in the period in which the contract is closed or the changes occur, respectively and are included in the Statements of Operations.  The Fund also trades futures contracts on the London Metals Exchange (LME). The valuation pricing for LME contracts is based on action of a committee that incorporates prices from the most liquid trading sessions of the day and can also rely on other inputs such as supply and demand factors and bids and asks from open outcry sessions.  
     
  Forward Foreign Currency Contracts  
     
  Foreign currency contracts are those contracts where the Fund agrees to receive or deliver a fixed quantity of foreign currency for an agreed-upon price on an agreed future date.  Foreign currency contracts are valued daily, and the Fund s net equity therein, representing unrealized profit or loss on the contracts as measured by the difference between the forward foreign exchange rates at the dates of entry into the contracts and the forward rates at the reporting date, is included in the Statements of Financial Condition.  Realized profit (loss), net and change in unrealized profit (loss), net on foreign currency contracts are recognized in the period in which the contract is closed or the changes occur, respectively and are included in the Statements of Operations.  
     
  Interest Rates and Income  
     
  BofA Corp. s  Interest Earning Program , which offers interest on cash balances subject to a negotiated schedule, will generally apply to Fund cash assets during any time they are maintained by MLAI with its affiliates.   The present interest rate under the Interest Earning Program on U.S. dollar cash balances is the daily effective federal funds rate less 20 basis points, recalculated and accrued daily, and subject to a floor of 0%, except for currencies designated by MLPF S as  negative interest rate currencies .  MLPF S deposits certain of the Fund s assets as margin or collateral with clearinghouses and/or depositories. As a result of the present low interest rate environment, these clearinghouses and depositories charge MLPF S fees to account for the negative interest rates on cash balances for certain currencies, which may change from time to time. Accordingly, MLPF S charges the Fund a  negative interest rate fee  for any currencies designated by MLPF S as a  negative interest rate currency .  
     
  Income Taxes  
     
  No provision for income taxes has been made in the accompanying financial statements as each investor is individually responsible for reporting income or loss based on such investor s share of the Fund s income and expenses as reported for income tax purposes.  
     
  The Fund follows the ASC guidance on accounting for uncertain tax positions. This guidance provides how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements.  This guidance also requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Fund s financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are  more-likely-than-not  to be sustained by the applicable tax authority.  Tax positions with respect to tax at the Fund level not deemed to meet the  more-likely-than-not  threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year.  A prospective investor should be aware that, among other things, income  
     
 20   

taxes could have a material adverse effect on the periodic calculations of the Net Asset Value of the Fund, including reducing the Net Asset Value of the Fund to reflect reserves for income taxes, such as foreign withholding taxes, that may be payable by the Fund. This could cause benefits or detriments to certain investors, depending upon the timing of their entry and exit from the Fund. MLAI has analyzed the Fund s tax positions and has concluded that no provision for income tax is required in the Fund s financial statements. The following is the major tax jurisdiction for the Fund and the earliest tax year subject to examination: United States   2012.  
     
  Reform Act  
     
  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act amended the definition of  eligible contract participant  and the Fund expects to meet the amended definition as it applies to trading in  retail forex  transactions so long as its total assets exceed $10 million.  If the Fund does not meet the definition of  eligible contract participant  for purposes of trading in  retail forex  transactions, it could lead to the Fund being unable to trade such transactions in the interbank market and bearing higher upfront and mark-to-market margin, less favorable trade pricing, and the possible imposition of new or increased fees.   Retail forex  markets available to parties that do not meet the definition of  eligible contract participant  could also be significantly less liquid than the interbank market.  Moreover, the creditworthiness of the counterparties with whom the Fund may be required to trade in such circumstances could be significantly weaker than the creditworthiness of MLI and the currency forward counterparties with which the Fund would otherwise engage for its currency forward transactions.  
     
  Results of Operations  
     
   January 1, 2016 to September 30, 2016   
     
   January 1, 2016 to March 31, 2016   
     
  The Fund experienced a net trading profit of $3,148,113 before brokerage commissions and related fees in the first quarter of 2016. The Fund s profits were primarily attributable to the interest rates, energy, currency and stock indices sectors. The metals and agriculture sectors posted losses.  
     
  The interest rate sector posted profits to the Fund. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter as the Trading Program continued its long positions in bonds (short yields) delta throughout January. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the first quarter. The Trading Program continued with its long bonds (short yields) delta throughout February.  Long positions in the Japanese 10-year and gilt positions led the way in positive performance for bond contracts. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the quarter. The Trading Program entered March with long bonds (short yields), however, the whipsaw action in prices saw some reduction of this exposure at the start of the month, muting the benefits from the rise in bond prices seen towards the end of the month. Long positioning in Italian and U.S. government bonds benefited the Fund, but this positive performance was partially offset by negative performance from the Trading Program s long positioning in the Australian 10-year and 3-year bonds.  
     
  The energy sector posted profits to the Fund. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning through the middle of the quarter. The Trading Program s short positioning in natural gas and West Texas Intermediate were the top contributors in February. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the quarter. The Trading Program s short positions in energies resulted in negative performance for the Fund, with natural gas and West Texas Intermediate finishing the month as the top detractors.  
     
 21   

The currency sector posted profits to the Fund. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter.  The U.S. dollar gained ground versus emerging market currencies in particular, as well as their G-10 counterparts. Three-month ATM-FX generally rose throughout January, with an unwinding of  carry pairs  mainly in AUD-JPY. The U.S. dollar index (DXY), regained lost ground. The Euro continued to trade sideways while still seeing plenty of intra-day volatility. The devaluation of the Japanese yen affected the Asia-Pacific region, with many pairs losing versus the dollar. In the FX space, top contributors to the Fund performance included the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso, while the New Zealand dollar and Polish zloty were the main detractors. Overall, within FX, the Fund increased its risk. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the quarter due to sharp moves and trend reversals. Specifically, the U.S. dollar initially sold off as the Japanese yen showed some strength. This resulted in negative performance from the Trading Program s short positions in the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the quarter. The Trading Program had short positions in the U.S. dollar versus other currencies, which allowed the model to capitalize on the U.S. dollar weakness throughout March. The U.S. dollar lost ground after the G20 Summit in Shanghai, where various comments were made surrounding a lack of  currency wars , coupled with a more dovish tone to the most recent U.S. Federal Reserve language. While most of the G10 currency pairs gained versus the dollar, it was emerging market currencies that saw more pronounced gains. The Trading Program s long positioning in the Polish zloty and Turkish lira (versus the U.S. dollar) were the top positions in the sector for March.  
     
  The stock indices sector posted profits to the Fund. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter. Top contributors to performance within equities included the Bovespa (Brazil) and Russell 2000 Index. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the quarter. The Trading Program entered February with an aggregate net short exposure and maintained bearish positioning throughout the month to varying degrees. The top contributions came from long VIX and short NSE Nifty positions. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the quarter. The Trading Program entered March with a moderate net short position exposure, but as volatility came in and the month progressed, the aggregate exposure transitioned to a moderate net long delta. A large move lower in volatility indices resulted in the VIX Index trading back to lows not seen since last year.  
     
  The metals sector posted losses to the Fund. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter which reversed in the middle of the quarter. Metal prices squeezed higher off lows which hurt the Trading Program s performance due to aggregate short positioning in metals contracts. Despite flipping from short to long positioning over February, silver and platinum were the top detractors in the metals sector. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the quarter. Metals were subject to profit taking and some locking-in of low prices at the beginning of March, followed by a drift back to flat performance towards the end of the month. Short palladium was the top detractor in the metals space.  
     
  The agriculture sector posted losses to the Fund.  Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter due to a large squeeze in corn and wheat owing to a bullish crop report showing higher levels of exports. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the quarter. The Trading Program short positions benefited the strategy and positive returns were generated from a sell-off in corn and wheat due to a strong supply environment. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the quarter. The Trading Program began with net short positions exposure that was considerably reduced by the end of March. Large trend reversals were seen as traders looked to position ahead of quarterly reports. The Trading Program s short positioning in wheat and soybean contracts posted the largest losses in agricultures for the month.  
     
 22   

April 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016   
     
  The Fund experienced a net trading loss of $2,509,656 before brokerage commissions and related fees in the second quarter of 2016. The Fund s profits were primarily attributable to interest rates and  agriculture sectors. The currency, metals, energy and stock indices sectors posted losses.  
     
  The interest rate sector posted profits to the Fund. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter due to a negative rates environment in two of the major government bond issuing markets and yields rose across the space. The interest rates sector was influenced by central banks and whether or not they will provide further monetary policy stimulus measures. This lead to uncertainty surrounding the European Central Bank, The U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan meetings. Overall, the Central Bank kept stimulus and rates on hold, however, the U.S. Federal Reserve acknowledged that global markets face pressures. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the quarter with its long bonds (short yields) exposure throughout May. This exposure increased throughout May as yields traded lower towards the second half of the month. A sharp rally in yields towards the end of the month harmed performance in the sector. These sharp moves halted relatively quickly and the bond futures space returned moderately positive performance in May. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of quarter. Bonds was the top performing sector in June with the Trading Program s long positions in Gilts, U.S. 2 and 5 year Treasury bonds leading the way in terms of positive performance.  
     
  The agriculture sector posted profits to the Fund.  Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter. The Trading Program started April net short but a sharp reversal in major markets owing to the U.S. dollar weakness and a short squeeze resulted in difficult conditions for the sector. The Trading Program started April with a small net short delta in the meats space and this increased slightly throughout the month to see a small positive return. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the quarter. The Trading Program started May moderately net short positions and flipped modestly to long positions in the agriculture sector by the end of May. The change can partially be attributed to a sharp rally in soybean meal due to a squeeze in supplies. The long soybean meal contract was the top contributor in the sector. Lean hog prices rallied which resulted in losses to short lean hog contracts. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of quarter.  The Trading Program started June with a small net long position, but this transitioned aggressively to net short positions by the end of the month as corn and wheat both plummeted after the quarterly U.S. Department of Agriculture report showed an uptick in planting.  The Trading Program posted profits to the Fund due to long positions in soybean, sugar and corn.  
     
  The currency sector posted losses to the Fund. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter.  FX markets confounded many in April as despite a move to negative rates in Europe and Japan both of these currencies outperformed the U.S. dollar. The British sterling also staged a recovery rally after perhaps a softening of  BREXIT  fear scenarios calmed the market. The Euro and emerging markets currencies rallied against the U.S. dollar. Emerging markets currencies rebounded as commodity markets retraced their losses. Further soft language from the U.S. Federal Reserve also put pressure on the dollar as traders continue to be split as to when the next rate rise will be, if at all, with some even speculating about QE4.  The Trading Program transitioned to net short positions in the U.S. dollar across G-10 and EM Forex Market at the end of March. Overall the Forex Market was a detractor from performance due to the Trading Program s short positions in the Canadian dollar and long positions in the Polish Zloty being the top detractors.  Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the second quarter. The Forex Markets were primarily led by a slight rebound in the U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar rallied against most G-10 currencies with the exception of the British sterling which rallied as  Brexit   
     
 23   

polls emerged showing a higher probability of a win for the  Remain  campaign. Words from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand coupled with poor employment numbers resulted in the New Zealand dollar dropping aggressively at the start May. The top detractors within the Forex Markets were the long positions in Turkish Lira and New Zealand positions. Poor employment numbers in Sweden resulted in gains from the short positions in the Swedish krona versus the U.S. dollar positions, however, gains in the sector were not enough to offset losses. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of quarter due to the Trading Program s long positioning in the Brazilian real and New Zealand dollar.  
     
  The metals sector posted losses to the Fund. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter with a small short exposure in metals and transitioned into net long exposure by the end of April. Strong performance from silver was countered by choppy conditions in palladium and copper. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the quarter as gold and silver gave back some gains seen in previous months as a combination of a slightly stronger U.S. dollar and a general dissipation of  risk off  settled in the market which eased the buying pressure on gold. The Trading Program s long gold and silver positions were the top detractors for the month, with both positions flipping short by the end of May. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the quarter.  The Trading Program s long positions in precious metals were overshadowed by its short positions in base metals hampering performance in this space.  
     
  The energy sector posted losses to the Fund. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter. The energy sector detracted from performance with the top detractor being West Texas Intermediate. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the second quarter. May saw a slight break in terms of volatility in oil prices. Fires in Canada, strikes in Nigeria, and tensions in Libya all contributed to the impression that supply is lower. Long gas oil was the top performer in energies in May. The Fund started the month with very modest long exposure and with various levels week over week, ending the month with an even more modest long exposure. The top detractor in the sector was RBOB gasoline with varying positioning throughout the month. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of quarter due to the Trading Program s short positions in natural gas.  
     
  The stock indices sector posted losses to the Fund. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter. The equity sector detracted from performance, despite small gains from the US. The top detractor in the sector was the Swiss Market Index and the CAC. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the second quarter as equity prices fell sharply at the start of the month, primarily led by the decrease in financial stocks along with the resources sector taking a break from its impressive rebound off the lows since the start of the year.  Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of quarter. The worst performing market in June was the DAX wherein the Trading Program started the month with short positions and ended with long positions by the end of June.  
     
   July 1, 2016 to September 30, 2016

  The agriculture sector posted losses to the Fund.  Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter.  The Trading Program started July with a small net short exposure after poor crop reports coming out of June. In the meats space, the Trading Program s losses on long positions in lean hogs were overshadowed by gains in feeder and live cattle. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the second quarter. The agriculture space was mixed in August with whipsaw trading in corn along with a more straightforward trend lower in wheat due to over-supply concerns. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the quarter. Profits in the Trading Program s short positions in lean hogs and long positions in sugar contracts were not enough to offset losses in the Trading Program s short positions in corn and wheat contracts.  
     
  The currency sector posted losses to the Fund. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter.  The U.S. dollar showed strength for much of July, however late in the month lowered close to where it began making for a flat month.

The Trading Program continued with its long bonds (short yields) delta throughout August. Yields had been trading sideways for most of the summer and August was no major deviation from this. The Trading Program increased its long bonds exposure towards the end of August and a slight increase in yields led to a negative return in the bond sector. Rates markets remained influenced by the Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen s comments towards a rate hike in 2016. The Trading Program posted losses to the Fund in rates with gains in FI-Europe and the interest rate swap space offset by losses in FI-Asia and FI-US.

The bond sector contained the majority of the best performing individual markets, with the U.S. 5 year note posting the strongest gains. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the quarter. February was difficult for fixed income, which experienced weak performance at the start of the month. However, after the Greek crisis found some resolution, European bonds traded lower in yield terms, particularly the German Bund and Italian BTPs. Elsewhere the U.S. and UK saw weakness in fixed income throughout February with yields rallying back to where they were at the start of the year. After the strong gains in fixed income in January, the Trading Program suffered a small relative loss on its fixed income positioning in February.  Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the quarter. It was a tough start to March for fixed income which saw yields initially go higher. However with the European Central Bank ratcheting up bond purchases and a commitment to buying bonds even with negative yields, European bonds traded lower. In the U.S., treasuries found a buyer in the medium to long term part of the curve.  Accordingly, the Fund benefitted from its continued long bias to the sector.  
     
  The stock indices sector posted profits to the Fund. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter while profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the quarter. European equities led the way, especially after a short term solution was found for Greece. However, all regions contributed to performance, with Europe and Asia strongest while U.S. equities made a comeback towards the end of February. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the quarter as the Fund suffered modest losses from long positioning in a number of markets including the S P as well as the FTSE Index.  
     
  The currency sector posted profits to the Fund.  Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter. The currency sector also contributed positively to performance in January, though it contained some of the top and bottom performing individual markets for the Trading Program. The dollar staged a rally, with the Fund benefitting from a short EUR position. The Trading Program had largely removed the Swiss Franc from its core strategies avoiding the negative impact from the decision by the Swiss National Bank to remove the currency cap against the Euro. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the quarter. The currencies sector contributed positively to returns with the U.S. dollar index finishing February higher albeit in a relatively tight range over the month. The Fund generated gains from both a short JPY position as well as a long NZD position. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the quarter. The currency sector was a source of gains for the Fund as the U.S. dollar index continued to  
     
 26   

rally against a number of currencies, which led to an element of profit taking as March drew to a close. The Fund made positive returns from the currency space despite this profit taking into March month end and, in particular, short exposure to the Euro and Swedish krone were a source of gains.  
     
  The energy sector posted profits to the Fund. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter as OPEC-induced over supply led to further declines in energy prices. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the quarter. Energy markets continued the rally which started in late January hurting the Fund s short positioning in the sector. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the quarter. Short Brent crude position was the significant source of profits.  
     
  The metals sector posted losses to the Fund. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the quarter. The commodities space suffered reversals in most sectors with only metals avoiding losses. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the quarter. Although the metals sector contribution was essentially flat, this sector did produce losses.  
     
  The agriculture sector posted losses to the Fund. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter primarily from short exposure to wheat during January. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the quarter because of the Fund s short positioning in crops which was to the detriment of Fund performance. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the quarter. The Fund experienced modest losses in crops from a short bias to the sector.  
     
   April 1, 2015 to June 30, 2015   
     
  The Fund experienced a net trading loss of $7,270,683 before brokerage commissions and related fees in the second quarter of 2015. The Fund s losses were primarily attributable to metals, stock indices, agriculture, energy, currency and interest rate sectors.  
     
  The metals sector posted losses to the Fund. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter due to gold and silver being down in the face of U.S. dollar weakness. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the quarter due to the Fund s short positioning in metals. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the quarter. Metals were the lone positive performing sector, with copper and palladium among the top performing markets for the Fund in June.  
     
  The stock indices sector posted losses to the Fund. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter. In April, the Fund maintained long exposure to the equities sector, favoring Asian and U.S. equities over EU equities for the majority of April. This regional diversification benefitted performance, and despite an aggressive sell off towards the end of April, equities posted a positive return. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the quarter.  Exposure remained fairly balanced across the three major regions, the United States, Europe and Asia, with U.S. equities posting positive performance. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the quarter. The Fund maintained mixed exposures to equities throughout June but ended June with an overall aggregate short exposure. General weakness throughout June was apparent. The close of June brought about a downturn in European and U.S. equities resulting from concerns over Greece. The Shanghai Composite saw large daily swings in both directions. Short positioning in the VIX was among the worst performing positions in June.  
     
  The agriculture sector posted losses to the Fund. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter. In April agriculture was strong with gains in short corn and wheat positions, where both trended lower in the face of good supply and higher yields due to better weather. Losses were posted to  
     
 27   

the Fund in the middle of the quarter as the crops sector was a detractor for May. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the quarter. Short positioning in crops in the beginning of June largely contributed to the negative performance as adverse weather conditions fuelled a large rally towards the end of June. Short wheat and corn positions were large contributors to the negative performance in the crop sector.  
     
  The energy sector posted losses to the Fund. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter. In the energy sector, U.S. dollar weakness and tensions in the Middle East led to a positive environment for energy prices. Higher prices for West Texas Intermediate continued to put pressure on short positions. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the quarter as energies was the largest detractor of the three commodities sectors. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the quarter. Short positioning in energies proved difficult with short natural gas positions causing a drag on performance after prices came off their lows from early in June.  
     
  The currency sector posted losses to the Fund. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter. The currency sector saw negative performance in April. Large volatility due to over positioning in short Euro and long U.S. dollar against many other currencies contributed to negative performance. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the quarter. The currency sector contributed positively in May. U.S. dollar strength against other currencies resulted in positive contribution from the sector. The short Japanese yen and Swedish krona forward positions were top contributors for the Fund. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the quarter. Currencies were one of the worst performing sectors in June. For the most part, the U.S. dollar traded sideways throughout June. This was largely due to Euro/U.S. dollar appearing stuck in a small range for much of June despite equities and bonds both moving aggressively on Greek headlines. The short Swedish krona forward position was the largest detractor in the sector.  
     
  The interest rate sector posted losses to the Fund. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter. In April, the fixed income sector saw a positive start as yields fell in major developed bond markets. However, a reversal towards the end of April erased performance, with yields in Germany rallying off the lows to end April. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the quarter. Losses were led by the bond sector as bond markets experienced volatility and price declines. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the quarter. Long positioning across fixed income markets continued through June. German bonds continued to sell off in June. Investor concerns over liquidity and inventory levels played out in volatile short term moves. Long positioning in the Japanese 10 YR accounted for the biggest losses in the bond sector. Eurodollar was the largest detractor in the rates sector with varied exposure throughout June, ending June with long exposure.  
     
   July 1, 2015 to September 30, 2015   
     
  The Fund experienced a net trading profit of $3,758,825 before brokerage commissions and related fees in the third quarter of 2015. The Fund s profits were primarily attributable to interest rates, energy, metals and currency sectors. The agriculture and stock indices sectors posted losses.  
     
  The interest rate sector posted profits to the Fund. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter. In July, the Fund benefitted from a long bias in bonds as bonds rallied towards the end of July. The largest positive contributor in the sector was the long EURO-BTP, with additional positive contributions from significant long positions in the U.S. 5 year and Japan 10 year bonds. The risk steadily increased throughout July. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the quarter. The Fund managed a positive return from fixed income in August, with the Eurodollar and the U.K. gilts amongst the best performers. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the quarter. Short term interest rates  
     
 28   

were mainly seen in the Eurodollar and Brazilian contracts where both had large moves and resulted in strong positive performance. The Eurodollar moved higher after the Federal Open Market Committee meeting and continued to trend higher in September. Brazilian short rates moved aggressively higher as the currency sold off to lows versus the U.S. dollar.  
     
  The energy sector posted profits to the Fund. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter as the Fund saw significant contributions to performance from short positions in West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude. Negotiations between the US and Iran resulted in implicit ramifications for oil markets, as traders anticipate an increase in supply if Iran is no longer subjected to an embargo. Profits resulted from this as the Fund was positioned to take advantage of the oil sell-off. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the quarter. Despite the strong price action, the Fund saw positive returns in a number of energy markets. Specifically, short positions in heating oil, West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude were amongst the top performing contracts. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the quarter as West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude traded lower throughout September resulting in positive returns in energies that allowed the commodities complex to contribute positively to performance.  
     
  The metals sector posted profits to the Fund. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter due the Fund s short positions in copper. The Fund also took advantage of the often aggressive markdowns seen in gold. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the quarter due to the Fund s short positioning in base metals, which provided small positive returns. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the quarter. The Fund saw slightly negative returns in metals in September, despite general weakness in the space. There was a strong bid mid-month that made it difficult to reap the benefits of lower prices. Platinum contributed positively to performance, but not enough to offset losses from copper, palladium, and gold.  
     
  The currency sector posted profits to the Fund. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter. Currencies were one of the top positive contributors throughout July as short Swedish krona, followed by short Canadian dollar positions were the top contributors in the currencies space. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the quarter as slightly larger negative returns seen in developed currencies, specifically short EURO and Swedish krona positions, offset the positive gains and resulted in the sector s negative performance. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the quarter. Currencies overall detracted from performance in September. For the most part the U.S. dollar was flat in September, whereas some emerging market currencies saw declines as a result of political turmoil. The U.S. dollar finished September close to where it started, despite a mid-month dip, after the Federal Open Market Committee failed to raise rates which caused some profit-taking by longs.  
     
  The agriculture sector posted losses to the Fund. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter. Crops were a slight detractor on performance, mainly due to long soybean positions that flipped short at the end of July. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the quarter as crops detracted from performance in August mainly due to a short position in soybeans. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the quarter. Crops detracted from performance, mainly due to short positioning in corn and wheat which experienced large short squeezes.  
     
  The stock indices sector posted losses to the Fund. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter. In July, U.S. dollar strength, political instability and weakness in commodities led to poor performance from emerging market equities. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the quarter.  The equities sector was the largest detractor from performance for August. Equities started August with net long exposure, however transitioned to net short by month-end. Despite a quiet start to August, global  
     
 29   

equities on aggregate plunged. This negative contribution was mainly due to a short position in the VIX, which was the largest detractor in the Fund for August. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the quarter. September was generally a difficult month for short equity positions in all regions due to the short term squeeze that occurred after the Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Major indices did re-test the August lows towards the end of September, as news flow became very bearish on individual sectors like autos and commodities.  
     
  The Fund has no applicable off-balance sheet arrangements or tabular disclosure of contractual obligations of the type described in Items 303(a)(4) and 303(a)(5) of Regulation S-K.  
     
  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  
     
   Introduction   
     
  The Fund is a speculative commodity pool. The market sensitive instruments held by it are acquired for speculative trading purposes and all or substantially all of the Fund s assets are subject to the risk of trading loss.  Unlike an operating company, the risk of market sensitive instruments is integral, not incidental, to the Fund s main line of business.  
     
  Market movements result in frequent changes in the fair market value of the Fund s open positions and, consequently, in its earnings and cash flow. The Fund s market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors, including the level and volatility of interest rates, exchange rates, equity price levels, the market value of financial instruments and contracts, the diversification effects among the Fund s open positions and the liquidity of the markets in which it trades.  
     
  The Fund, under the direction of the Trading Advisor, rapidly acquires and liquidates both long and short positions in a wide range of different markets.  Consequently, it is not possible to predict how a particular future market scenario will affect performance, and the Fund s past performance is not necessarily indicative of its future results.  
     
  Value at Risk is a measure of the maximum amount which the Fund could reasonably be expected to lose in a given market sector. However, the inherent uncertainty of the Fund s speculative trading and the recurrence in the markets traded by the Fund of market movements far exceeding expectations could result in actual trading or non-trading losses far beyond the indicated Value at Risk or the Fund s experience to date (i.e.,  risk of ruin ). In light of the foregoing, as well as the risks and uncertainties intrinsic to all future projections, the quantifications included in this section should not be considered to constitute any assurance or representation that the Fund s losses in any market sector will be limited to Value at Risk or by the Fund s attempts to manage its market risk.  
     
   Quantifying The Fund s Trading Value At Risk   
     
  Quantitative Forward-Looking Statements  
     
  The following quantitative disclosures regarding the Fund s market risk exposures contain  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the safe harbor from civil liability provided for such statements by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (set forth in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 ( Securities Act ) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Securities Exchange Act )). All quantitative disclosures in this section are deemed to be forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor, except for statements of historical fact.  
     
 30   

The Fund s risk exposure in the various market sectors traded by the Trading Advisor is quantified below in terms of Value at Risk.  Due to the Fund s fair value accounting, any loss in the fair value of the Fund s open positions is directly reflected in the Fund s earnings (realized or unrealized) and cash flow (in the case of exchange-traded contracts in which profits and losses on open positions are settled daily through variation margin).  
     
  Exchange maintenance margin requirements have been used by the Fund as the measure of its Value at Risk.  Maintenance margin requirements are set by exchanges to equal or exceed the maximum loss in the fair value of any given contract incurred in 95%-99% of the one-day time periods included in the historical sample (generally approximately one year) researched for purposes of establishing margin levels.  The maintenance margin levels are established by dealers and exchanges using historical price studies as well as an assessment of current market volatility (including the implied volatility of the options on a given futures contract) and economic fundamentals to provide a probabilistic estimate of the maximum expected near-term one-day price fluctuation.  
     
  In the case of market sensitive instruments which are not exchange-traded (almost exclusively currencies in the case of the Fund), the margin requirements for the equivalent futures positions have been used as Value at Risk.  In those rare cases in which a futures-equivalent margin is not available, dealers  margins have been used.  
     
  100% positive correlation in the different positions held in each market risk category has been assumed.  Consequently, the margin requirements applicable to the open contracts have been aggregated to determine each trading category s aggregate Value at Risk.  The diversification effects resulting from the fact that the Fund s positions are rarely, if ever, 100% positively correlated have not been reflected.  
     
   The Fund s Trading Value at Risk in Different Market Sectors   
     
  The following table indicates the average, highest and lowest trading Value at Risk associated with the Fund s open positions by market category for the fiscal period. For the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Fund s average capitalization was $28,772,202 and $65,338,236, respectively.  
     
    September 30, 2016    

31   

September 30, 2015    

Material Limitations on Value at Risk as an Assessment of Market Risk   
     
  The face value of the market sector instruments held by the Fund is typically many times the applicable maintenance margin requirement (maintenance margin requirements generally ranging between approximately 1% and 10% of contract face value) as well as many times the capitalization of the Fund.  The magnitude of the Fund s open positions creates a  risk of ruin  not typically found in most other investment vehicles.  Because of the size of its positions, certain market conditions   unusual, but historically recurring from time to time   could cause the Fund to incur severe losses over a short period of time.   The foregoing Value at Risk table   as well as the past performance of the Fund   gives no indication of this  risk of ruin.   
     
  Non-Trading Risk  
     
  Foreign Currency Balances; Cash on Deposit with MLPF S and MLI.  
     
  The Fund has non-trading market risk on its foreign cash balances not needed for margin. However, these balances (as well as the market risk they represent) are immaterial.  
     
  The Fund also has non-trading market risk on approximately 90% of its assets which are held in cash at MLPF S. The value of this cash is not interest rate sensitive, but there is cash flow risk in that if interest rates decline so will the cash flow generated on these monies.  
     
  Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Primary Trading Risk Exposures  
     
  The following qualitative disclosures regarding the Fund s market risk exposures   except for (i) those disclosures that are statements of historical fact and (ii) the descriptions of how the Fund manages its primary market risk exposures   constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act. The Fund s primary market risk exposures as well as the strategies used and to be used by MLAI and the Trading Advisor for managing such exposures are subject to numerous uncertainties, contingencies and risks, any one of which could cause the actual results of the Fund s risk controls to differ materially from the objectives of such strategies. Government interventions, defaults and expropriations, illiquid markets, the emergence of dominant fundamental factors, political upheavals, changes in historical price relationships, an influx of new market participants, increased regulation and many other factors could result in material losses as well as in material changes to the risk exposures and the risk management strategies of the Fund. There can be no assurance that the Fund s current market exposure and/or risk management strategies will not  
     
 32   

change materially or that any such strategies will be effective in either the short- or long-term. Investors must be prepared to lose all or substantially all of the time value of their investment in the Fund.  
     
  The following were the primary trading risk exposures of the Fund as of December 31, 2015, by market sector. There have been no material changes at September 30, 2016.  
     
   Interest Rates   
     
  Interest rate movements directly affect the price of derivative sovereign bond positions held by the Fund and indirectly the value of its stock index and currency positions. Interest rate movements in one country as well as relative interest rate movements between countries may materially impact the Fund s profitability. The Fund s primary interest rate exposure is to interest rate fluctuations in the United States and the other G-7 countries.  However, the Fund may also take positions in the government debt of smaller nations. MLAI anticipates that G-7 interest rates will remain the primary market exposure of the Fund for the foreseeable future.  
     
   Currencies   
     
  The Fund trades in a number of currencies. However, the Fund s major exposures have typically been in the U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S. dollar/Euro and U.S. dollar/Swiss franc positions. The Fund does not anticipate that the risk profile of the Fund s currency sector will change significantly in the future. The currency trading Value at Risk figure includes foreign margin amounts converted into U.S. dollars with an incremental adjustment to reflect the exchange rate risk of maintaining Value at Risk in a functional currency other than U.S. dollars.  
     
   Stock Indices   
     
  The Fund s primary equity exposure is to S P 500, Nikkei and German DAX equity index price movements. The Fund is primarily exposed to the risk of adverse price trends or static markets in the major U.S., European and Asian indices.  
     
   Metals   
     
  The Fund s metals market exposure is to fluctuations in the price of precious and non-precious metals.  
     
   Agricultural Commodities   
     
  The Fund s primary agricultural commodities exposure is to agricultural price movements which are often directly affected by severe or unexpected weather conditions. Soybeans, cocoa and livestock accounted for the substantial bulk of the Fund s agricultural commodities exposure.  
     
   Energy   
     
  The Fund s primary energy market exposure is to natural gas and crude oil price movements, often resulting from political developments in the Middle East. Oil prices can be volatile and substantial profits and losses have been and are expected to continue to be experienced in this market.  
     
 33   

Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Non-Trading Risk Exposure  
     
  The following were the primary non-trading risk exposures of the Fund as of December 31, 2015. There have been no material changes at September 30, 2016.  
     
   Foreign Currency Balances   
     
  The Fund s primary foreign currency balances are in Japanese yen, British pounds and Euros.  
     
   U.S. Dollar Cash Balance   
     
  The Fund holds the vast majority of its U.S. dollars in cash at MLPF S and MLI. The Fund has immaterial cash flow interest rate risk on its cash on deposit with MLPF S in that declining interest rates would cause the income from such cash to decline.  
     
  Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Means of Managing Risk Exposure  
     
   Trading Risk   
     
  MLAI has procedures in place intended to control market risk, although there can be no assurance that they will, in fact, succeed in doing so.  While MLAI does not itself intervene in the markets to hedge or diversify the Fund s market exposure, MLAI may urge the Trading Advisor to reallocate positions in an attempt to avoid over-concentrations.  However, such interventions are unusual, except in cases in which it appears that the Trading Advisor has begun to deviate from past practice and trading policies or to be trading erratically. MLAI s basic control procedures consist of the process of monitoring the Trading Advisor with the market risk controls being applied by the Trading Advisor itself.  
     
   Risk Management   
     
  The management of risk is an integral part of the Trading Program.  The Trading Advisor s focus within risk management is on targeting, measuring and managing risk.  Owing to the leverage inherent in futures trading, position sizes are set according to the Trading Advisor s expectation of the risk that the positions will provide, rather than the amount of capital required to fund the positions.  
     
   Non-Trading Risk   
     
  The Fund controls the non-trading exchange rate risk by regularly converting foreign currency balances back into U.S. dollars at least once per week, and more frequently if a particular foreign currency balance becomes unusually high.  
     
  The Fund has cash flow interest rate risk on its cash on deposit with MLPF S in that declining interest rates would cause the income from such cash to decline. However, a certain amount of cash or cash equivalents must be held by the Fund in order to facilitate margin payments and pay expenses and redemptions. MLAI does not take any steps to limit the cash flow risk on its cash held on deposit at MLPF S.  
     
 34   

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  
     
   Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
     
  MLAI s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, on behalf of the Fund, have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act) with respect to the Fund as of the end of the quarter which ended September 30, 2016 and, based on their evaluation, have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective.  
     
   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   
     
  No change in internal control over financial reporting (in connection with Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Fund s internal control over financial reporting.
