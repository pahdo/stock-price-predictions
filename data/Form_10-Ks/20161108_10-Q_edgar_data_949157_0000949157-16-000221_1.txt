CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY 
  Condensed Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
  Three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015    
  (amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 
  (Unaudited) 
   
   The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Century Aluminum Company should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  In management s opinion, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature, that are necessary for a fair presentation of financial results for the interim periods presented.  Operating results for the first   nine   months of   2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  .  Throughout this Form 10-Q, and unless expressly stated otherwise or as the context otherwise requires, "Century Aluminum," "Century," the "Company", "we," "us," "our" and "ours" refer to Century Aluminum Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.   
   
           2. 
    Related party transactions 
     Our significant related party transactions occurring during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 are described below.  We believe that all of the transactions with our related parties were at prices that approximate market. 
  Glencore ownership 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Glencore plc and its affiliates (together "Glencore") owned   42.9%   of Century s outstanding common stock and all of our outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred stock resulting in   47.5%   ownership in Century Aluminum.  
  Sales to Glencore  
  We are party to an agreement with Glencore pursuant to which we agreed to sell, and Glencore agreed to purchase, substantially all of our primary aluminum production in North America for 2015 and 2016 on a take-or-pay basis at prices determined by reference to the Midwest Transaction Price plus additional negotiated product premiums.   The current term of the agreement continues through December 31, 2016.  In addition, we have agreed to sell approximately   24,500   tonnes of molten aluminum to Glencore during 2017 at prices based on the Midwest Transaction Price. 
  We sell primary aluminum produced at our Grundartangi, Iceland smelter ("Grundartangi") under a long-term sales contract through 2017 with Glencore at prices based on the London Metal Exchange ("LME") price for primary aluminum plus the European Duty Paid premium and any applicable product premiums.  We also received tolling fees from Glencore under a tolling agreement that provided for delivery of primary aluminum produced at our Grundartangi facility through June 2016.  The fee paid by Glencore under this tolling agreement was based on the LME price for primary aluminum plus a portion of the European Duty Paid premium. 
  Glencore purchases the aluminum we produce for resale. 
  Purchases from Glencore 
  We purchase alumina from Glencore under a long-term supply agreement and on a spot basis.  Pursuant to our current agreement, Glencore has agreed to supply us with alumina through 2017 at prices indexed to the LME price of primary aluminum.  In 2015 and 2016, upon mutual agreement, all of our purchases from Glencore under this agreement were priced based on a published alumina index. 
  Financial contracts with Glencore 
  During 2016, we entered into certain financial contracts with Glencore.  Refer to     Note 15 Derivative instruments    to the consolidated financial statements included herein.  Settlements of financial contracts with Glencore are not material to the 
  consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.

Transactions with Baise Haohai Carbon Co., Ltd. ("BHH") 
  We own a   40%   stake in BHH, a joint venture that owns a carbon anode and cathode facility located in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of south China.  We purchase carbon anodes from BHH.   In the fourth quarter of 2015, we completed the construction of a second furnace at our carbon anode facility in Vlissingen, Netherlands.  This investment increased our capacity to produce carbon anodes and significantly reduced the quantity of carbon anodes that we source from BHH.  As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we made the decision to pursue an exit from our investment in BHH and recorded an   $11,584   impairment loss. 
  Summary 
  A summary of the aforementioned significant related party transactions for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is as follows:  

3. 
    Ravenswood impairment 
       
  On July 27, 2015, we announced the immediate and permanent closure of our Ravenswood, West Virginia aluminum smelter ("Ravenswood"). Ravenswood has been idled since February 2009. The decision to permanently close Ravenswood was based on the inability to secure a competitive power contract for the smelter, compounded by challenging aluminum market conditions largely driven by increased exports of aluminum from China. 
    
  At June 30, 2015, we recorded an impairment charge of   $30,850   related to Ravenswood.  Based on a tentative agreement for the sale of the assets, we recorded an additional impairment charge of   $3,830  , included in Ravenswood charges in the consolidated statements of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 
    
  We classified the estimated salvage value of the property, plant and equipment within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as its fair value was determined based on recent comparable transactions with inputs that are not readily observable in the market.  

4. 
    Business acquisitions 
     Acquisition of Mt. Holly aluminum smelter 
  On October 23, 2014, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Berkeley Aluminum Inc. ("Berkeley") entered into a stock purchase agreement (the "Stock Purchase Agreement") with Alumax Inc. ("Alumax"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alcoa Inc. ("Alcoa"), pursuant to which Berkeley acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Alumax of South Carolina, Inc. ("Alumax of SC") and thereby acquired Alcoa s   50.3%   stake in Mt. Holly.  Berkeley had previously owned   49.7%   of Mt. Holly.  Immediately following the consummation of the transaction on December 1, 2014, Berkeley merged with and into Alumax of SC with Alumax of SC surviving and changing its name to Century Aluminum of South Carolina, Inc. ("CASC").  Following the consummation of the transaction, CASC owned   100%   of Mt. Holly.  Mt. Holly, located in Goose Creek, South Carolina, employed approximately   600   people and had an annual production capacity of   231,000   tonnes of primary aluminum as of the acquisition date.  
  Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Berkeley acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Alumax of SC for   $67,500   in cash subject to a contingent earn-out payment, working capital and other similar adjustments.  The acquisition was funded with available cash on hand.

  (Unaudited) 

We accounted for this transaction as a step acquisition and this resulted in a non-cash pre-tax gain of   $15,955   at closing.  Acquisition-related costs for Mt. Holly of   $1,539   were expensed to selling, general and administrative expenses in the period that they were incurred.  
  The following table summarizes all of the elements of purchase consideration for the transaction as of December 1, 2014. 

We received payments from Alcoa of   $12,500   in settlement of the contingent consideration in March 2016,   $11,313   for economic and working capital adjustments in April 2015 and   $2,400   at closing which was primarily for post-employment benefits. 
  We recognized gains on contingent consideration of   $1,523   and   $18,337  , respectively, during the three and nine month periods ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  The total net cash consideration paid to Alcoa after final resolution of all post-closing adjustments, including the earn-out provision, was   $41,487  . 
   
           5. 
    Fair value measurements 
     The following section describes the valuation methodology used to measure our financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value and are categorized based on the fair value hierarchy described in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 820, "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures."

    Trust assets are currently invested in money market funds.  These trust assets are held to fund the non-qualified supplemental executive pension benefit obligations for certain of our officers.  The trust has sole authority to invest the funds in secure interest producing investments consisting of short-term securities issued or guaranteed by the United States government or cash and cash equivalents. 
     Our fair value measurements include the consideration of market risks that other market participants might consider in pricing the particular asset or liability, specifically non-performance risk and counterparty credit risk.  Considerations of the non-performance risk and counterparty credit risk are used to establish the appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates used in our fair value measurements.

Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and the placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.  There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 during the periods presented.  There were no transfers into or out of Level 3 during the periods presented.  It is our policy to recognize transfers into and transfers out of Level 3 as of the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.   
  The following table sets forth our financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis by the level of input within the ASC 820 fair value hierarchy.

    Earnings (loss) per share 
     Basic earnings (loss) per share ("EPS") amounts are calculated by dividing net income (loss) allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  Diluted EPS amounts assume the issuance of common stock for all potentially dilutive common shares.   
  In periods when we report a net loss, all share-based compensation awards are excluded from the calculation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding because of their antidilutive effect on loss per share.  In periods when we report net income, certain share-based compensation awards may be excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS if the exercise price was greater than the average market price of the underlying common stock. 
  The following table shows the basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

    Shareholders  equity 
     Common Stock 
   As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   195,000,000   shares of common stock,   $0.01   cent par value per share, authorized under our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, of which   94,262,108   shares were issued and   87,075,587   shares were outstanding at   September 30, 2016  ;   94,224,571   shares were issued and   87,038,050   shares were outstanding at   December 31, 2015  . 
  The rights, preferences and privileges of holders of our common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of shares of any series of our preferred stock which are currently outstanding, including our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, or which we may designate and issue in the future.  
  Stock Repurchase Program  
  In 2011, our Board of Directors approved a   $60,000   common stock repurchase program which was expanded in 2015 to   $130,000  .   Through December 31, 2015 we had repurchased   7,186,521   shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of   $86,276  .  We have made   no   share repurchases since April 2015 and we have   $43,724   remaining under the repurchase program authorization.  The repurchase program may be expanded, suspended or discontinued by our Board, in its sole discretion, at any time.   
  Shares of common stock repurchased are recorded at cost as treasury stock and result in a reduction of shareholders  equity in the consolidated balance sheets.  From time to time, treasury shares may be reissued and we use an average cost method for determining the cost for reissued treasury shares.  The difference between the cost of the shares and the reissuance price is added to or deducted from additional paid-in capital. 
  Preferred Stock 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   we had   5,000,000   shares of preferred stock,   $0.01   cent par value per share, authorized under our Restated Certificate of Incorporation.  In 2008, we issued   160,000   shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, all of which are held by Glencore, and at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   76,378   and   76,539   shares were outstanding, respectively.  The issuance of common stock under our stock incentive programs, debt exchange transactions and any stock offering that excludes Glencore participation triggers anti-dilution provisions of the preferred stock agreement and results in the automatic conversion of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shares into shares of common stock. The conversion of preferred to common shares is   100   shares of common for each share of preferred stock.  Our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock has a par value of   $0.01   per share.   
  Our Board of Directors may issue preferred stock in one or more series and determine for each series the dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption rights, liquidation preferences, sinking fund terms and the number of shares constituting that series, as well as the designation thereof.  Depending upon the terms of preferred stock established by our Board of Directors, any or all of the preferred stock could have preference over the common stock with respect to dividends and other distributions and upon the liquidation of Century.  In addition, issuance of any shares of preferred stock with voting powers may dilute the voting power of the outstanding common stock.

The Common and Preferred Stock Activity table below contains additional information about preferred stock conversions during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

8. 
    Income taxes 
     We recorded an income tax benefit for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $848   and   $3,237  , respectively, which primarily consisted of foreign income taxes.  
  We recorded an income tax benefit for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   of   $2,161   and income tax expense of   $12,205   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   which primarily consisted of foreign and state income taxes. 
  Our income tax benefit or expense is based on an annual effective tax rate forecast, including estimates and assumptions that could change during the year.  The application of the requirements for accounting for income taxes in interim periods, after consideration of our valuation allowance, causes a significant variation in the typical relationship between income tax expense and pretax accounting income.  
  As of September 30, 2016  , all of Century's U.S. and certain foreign deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, continue to be subject to a valuation allowance.

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out method.

    The IRBs are classified as current liabilities because they are remarketed weekly and could be required to be repaid upon demand if there is a failed remarketing. The IRB interest rate at   September 30, 2016   was   1.04%  . 
     U.S. Revolving Credit Facility 
  We and certain of our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries are party to a senior secured revolving credit facility, dated May 24, 2013, as amended, with a syndicate of lenders which provides for borrowings of up to   $150,000   in the aggregate, including up to   $110,000   under a letter of credit sub-facility (the "U.S. revolving credit facility").   Our U.S. revolving credit facility matures in June 2020. Any letters of credit issued and outstanding under the U.S. revolving credit facility reduce our borrowing availability on a dollar-for-dollar basis.  The availability of funds under the U.S. revolving credit facility is limited by a specified borrowing base consisting of accounts receivable, inventory and qualified cash deposits of the borrowers which meet the eligibility criteria.  
  Status of our U.S. revolving credit facility: 

Iceland Revolving Credit Facility 
  We have also entered into, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Nordural Grundartangi ehf, a   $50,000   revolving credit facility, dated November 27, 2013 (the "Iceland revolving credit facility").  The Iceland revolving credit facility expires on November 27, 2018.  The availability of funds under the Iceland revolving credit facility is limited by a specified borrowing base consisting of inventory and accounts receivable of Grundartangi.

  General.    On June 4, 2013, we issued   $250,000   of our   7.5%   Notes due June 1, 2021 (the "2021 Notes") in a private offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  The 2021 Notes were issued at a discount and bear interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum on the principal amount,     payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on June 1st and December 1st of each     year. 
  Fair Value.    Fair value for our 2021 Notes was based on the latest trading data available and was   $230,783   and   $169,220  , as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Although we use quoted market prices for identical debt instruments, the markets on which they trade are not considered to be active and are therefore considered Level 2 fair value measurements.

    Commitments and contingencies 
     Environmental Contingencies 
  Based upon all available information, we believe our current environmental liabilities do not have, and are not likely to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  However, because of the inherent uncertainties in estimating environmental liabilities primarily due to unknown facts and circumstances and changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, there can be no assurance that future capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance at currently or formerly owned or operated properties will not result in liabilities that may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  
  It is our policy to accrue for costs associated with environmental assessments and remedial efforts when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated.  The aggregate environmental-related accrued liabilities were $  1,519   and $  1,112   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  All accrued amounts have been recorded without giving effect to any possible future recoveries.  Costs for ongoing environmental compliance, including maintenance and monitoring are expensed as incurred. 
  In July 2006, we were named as a defendant, together with certain affiliates of Alcan Inc., in a lawsuit brought by Alcoa Inc. seeking to determine responsibility for certain environmental indemnity obligations related to the sale of a cast aluminum plate manufacturing facility located in Vernon, California, which we purchased from Alcoa Inc. in December 1998, and sold to Alcan Rolled Products-Ravenswood LLC in July 1999.  The complaint also seeks costs and attorney fees.  The matter was stayed by the court in 2008 to allow for the remediation of environmental areas at the site.  On June 30, 2016 the court ordered the stay lifted and reopened the case.  The matter is in a preliminary stage in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, and we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this action or estimate a range of possible losses related to this matter at this time.   
  Matters relating to the St. Croix Alumina Refining Facility 
  We are a party to a United States Environmental Protection Agency Administrative Order on Consent (the "Order") pursuant to which certain past and present owners of an alumina refining facility at St. Croix, Virgin Islands (the "St. Croix Alumina Refinery") have agreed to carry out a Hydrocarbon Recovery Plan to remove and manage hydrocarbons floating on groundwater underlying the facility.  Pursuant to the Hydrocarbon Recovery Plan, recovered hydrocarbons and groundwater are delivered to the adjacent petroleum refinery where they are received and managed.  Through   September 30, 2016  , we have expended approximately $  1,085   on the Hydrocarbon Recovery Plan.  At this time, we are not able to estimate the amount of any future potential payments under this indemnification to comply with the Order, but we do not anticipate that any such amounts will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, regardless of the final outcome.  
  In December 2010, Century was among several defendants named in a lawsuit filed by plaintiffs who either worked, resided or owned property in the area downwind from the St. Croix Alumina Refinery.  In March 2011, Century was also named a defendant in a nearly identical suit brought by certain additional plaintiffs.  The plaintiffs in both suits allege damages caused by the presence of red mud and other particulates coming from the alumina facility and are seeking unspecified monetary damages, costs and attorney fees as well as certain injunctive relief.  We tendered indemnity and defense to St. Croix Alumina LLC and Alcoa Alumina   Chemical LLC under the terms of an acquisition agreement relating to the facility and have filed motions to dismiss plaintiffs  claims.  In August 2015, the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands, Division of St. Croix denied the motions to dismiss but ordered all plaintiffs to refile individual complaints.  At this time, it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of or to estimate a range of possible losses for any of the foregoing actions relating to the St. Croix Alumina Refinery. 
  Legal Contingencies 
  In addition to the foregoing matters, we have pending against us or may be subject to various lawsuits, claims and proceedings related primarily to employment, commercial, stockholder, safety and health matters.  While the results of such litigation matters and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  However, because of the nature and inherent uncertainties of litigation, should the outcome of these actions be unfavorable, our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.

In evaluating whether to accrue for losses associated with legal contingencies, it is our policy to take into consideration factors such as the facts and circumstances asserted, our historical experience with contingencies of a similar nature, the likelihood of our prevailing and the severity of any potential loss.  For some matters, no accrual is established because we have assessed our risk of loss to be remote.  Where the risk of loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record an accrual, either on an individual basis or with respect to a group of matters involving similar claims, based on the factors set forth above.    
  When we have assessed that a loss associated with legal contingencies is reasonably possible, we determine if estimates of possible losses or ranges of possible losses are in excess of related accrued liabilities, if any.  Based on current knowledge, management has ascertained estimates for losses that are reasonably possible and management does not believe that any reasonably possible outcomes in excess of our accruals, if any, either individually or in aggregate, would be material to our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  We reevaluate and update our assessments and accruals as matters progress over time. 
  Ravenswood Retiree Medical Benefits changes 
  In November 2009, Century Aluminum of West Virginia ("CAWV") filed a class action complaint for declaratory judgment against the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union ("USW"), the USW s local and certain CAWV retirees, individually and as class representatives, seeking a declaration of CAWV s rights to modify/terminate retiree medical benefits.  Later in November 2009, the USW and representatives of a retiree class filed a separate suit against CAWV, Century Aluminum Company, Century Aluminum Master Welfare Benefit Plan, and various John Does with respect to the foregoing.   
  As of the date of this filing, we believe we have reached a tentative agreement to settle these actions, subject to entering into a definitive written settlement agreement among the parties and obtaining court approval after notice to the class.  For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we recognized a   $23,000   liability in the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding expense included in Ravenswood charges in the consolidated statements of operations associated with this settlement.  The tentative agreement currently anticipates that a   $5,000   payment would be made upon the court's final approval of the settlement agreement and   $2,000   annually thereafter for nine years.  
  PBGC Settlement 
  In April 2013, we entered into a settlement agreement with the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation ("PBGC") regarding an alleged "cessation of operations" at our Ravenswood facility as a result of the curtailment of operations at the facility and, pursuant to the agreement, we agreed to make additional contributions (above any minimum required contributions) to our defined benefit pension plans totaling approximately   $17,400  .  The agreement permits us to defer payments during periods of lower primary aluminum prices relative to our cost of operations.  We remeasure aluminum prices against our cost of operations on an annual basis based on our fourth quarter results.  To the extent that we elect to defer one or more of these payments, we are required to provide the PBGC with acceptable security for any such deferred payments.  We made contributions pursuant to this agreement of   $1,100    in March 2015 and   $6,700    in 2013.  We did not make any contributions during 2014 and have not made any contributions through September 30, 2016.  The remaining contributions under this agreement are approximately   $9,600  .  
  Power Commitments and Contingencies 
  Hawesville 
  Hawesville has a power supply arrangement with Kenergy and EDF Trading North America, LLC ( EDF") which provides market-based power to the Hawesville smelter. Under this arrangement, the power companies purchase power on the open market and pass it through to Hawesville at Midcontinent Independent System Operator ("MISO") pricing plus transmission and other costs. The power supply arrangement with Kenergy has an effective term through December 2023. The arrangement with EDF to act as our market participant with MISO has an effective term through May 2017, extending year to year thereafter unless a   one year   notice is given.

Sebree 
  Sebree has a power supply arrangement with Kenergy and EDF which provides market-based power to the Sebree smelter. Similar to the arrangement at Hawesville, the power companies purchase power on the open market and pass it through to Sebree at MISO pricing plus transmission and other costs. The power supply arrangement with Kenergy has an effective term through December 2023. The arrangement with EDF to act as our market participant with MISO has an effective term through May 2017, extending year to year thereafter unless a   one year   notice is given. 
  Mt. Holly 
  Mt. Holly has a power supply arrangement pursuant to which   25%   of the Mt. Holly load is served from the South Carolina Public Service Authority s ("Santee Cooper") generation at a standard cost-based industrial rate and   75%   of the Mt. Holly load is sourced from a third party supplier from generation that is outside Santee Cooper s service territory at market prices that are tied to natural gas prices. The agreement with Santee Cooper has a term through December 31, 2018.  The current third party supply contract has a term through December 31, 2017. Both of these agreements may be terminated by Mt. Holly on   60   days' notice. 
  Grundartangi 
  Grundartangi has power purchase agreements for approximately   525   MW with HS Orka hf ("HS"), Landsvirkjun and Orkuveita Reykjavikur ("OR") to provide power to its Grundartangi smelter.  These power purchase agreements, which will expire on various dates from 2019 through 2036 (subject to extension), provide power at LME-based variable rates.  Each power purchase agreement contains take-or-pay obligations with respect to a significant percentage of the total committed and available power under such agreement. 
  Grundartangi recently reached an agreement with Landsvirkjun for an extension of the   161  MW power contract that would have expired in October 2019.  Under the terms of the extension, Landsvirkjun will continue to supply 161MW of power to Grundartangi from November 1, 2019 through December 31, 2023.  Under the terms of the extension, Grundartangi will continue to pay LME-based variable rates through October 2019 and will pay rates linked to the Nord Pool power market thereafter.   
  Helguvik 
  Nordural Helguvik ehf ("Helguvik") has power purchase agreements with HS and OR to provide power to the Helguvik project.  These power purchase agreements provide power at LME-based variable rates and contain take-or-pay obligations with respect to a significant percentage of the total committed and available power under such agreements.  The power purchase agreements contain certain conditions to HS s and OR s obligations.  HS (with respect to all phases) and OR (with respect to all phases other than the first phase) have alleged that certain of these conditions have not been satisfied.  The first stage of power under the OR power purchase agreement (approximately   47.5   MW) became available in the fourth quarter of 2011 and is currently being utilized at Grundartangi.  In July 2014, HS commenced arbitration proceedings against Helguvik seeking, among other things, an order declaring, (i) that the conditions to the power contract have not been fulfilled and, (ii) that the power contract is therefore no longer valid.  Arbitration hearings were held in April 2016 but the arbitral tribunal has yet to issue its decision.  
  Other Commitments and Contingencies 
  Labor Commitments  
  The bargaining unit employees at our Grundartangi, Vlissingen, Hawesville, Sebree and Ravenswood facilities are represented by labor unions, representing   64%   of our total workforce.  
  Approximately   84%   of Grundartangi s work force is represented by   five   labor unions, governed by a labor agreement which is effective through December 31, 2019 that establishes wages and work rules for covered employees.    100%   of Vlissingen's work force is represented by the Federation for the Metal and Electrical Industry ("FME") which negotiates working conditions with trade unions on behalf of its members.  In March 2016, a new labor agreement was reached with the FME which is effective retroactively from May 1, 2015 to June 1, 2018.

    Derivative instruments 
     As a global producer of primary aluminum, our operating results and cash flows from operations are subject to risk of fluctuations in the market prices of primary aluminum.  We enter into financial contracts from time to time to manage our exposure to such risk.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had entered into LME forward financial sales contracts with Glencore to fix the forward LME price of approximately   45,000   tonnes of primary aluminum (the  Forward Sales Contracts ).  The Forward Sales Contracts settle monthly, on a ratable basis, through December 31, 2017.  From time to time, we enter into financial contracts to offset fixed price sales arrangements with certain of our customers.  As of September 30, 2016, we had entered into such arrangements with respect to approximately   8,200   tonnes of primary aluminum (the  fixed for floating swaps ).  Fixed for floating swaps settle at various dates up to and including   January 2018  .  
  We record our financial contracts at fair value in prepaid and other current assets, due from/to affiliates, or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.  We value our derivative instruments using quoted market prices and other significant unobservable inputs.  These derivatives are not designated as cash flow hedges.  We recognize changes in fair value and settlements of these derivative instruments in net gain (loss) on forward and derivative contracts in the consolidated statements of operations as they occur. 
  Changes in fair value and settlements of these derivative instruments are not material to the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.

    Condensed consolidating financial information    
     Our 2021 Notes are guaranteed by each of our material existing and future domestic subsidiaries (The "Guarantor Subsidiaries"), except for Nordural US LLC and Century Aluminum Development LLC.  The Guarantor Subsidiaries are   100%   owned by Century.  All guarantees are full and unconditional; all guarantees are joint and several.  These notes are not guaranteed by our foreign subsidiaries (such foreign subsidiaries, Nordural US LLC and Century Aluminum Development LLC, collectively the  Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries ).  We allocate corporate expenses or income to our subsidiaries and charge interest on certain intercompany balances.  
    
  The following summarized condensed consolidating statements of comprehensive income (loss) for   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , condensed consolidating balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 and the condensed consolidating statements of cash flows for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   present separate results for Century, the Guarantor Subsidiaries, the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, consolidating adjustments and total consolidated amounts.  Although Century Aluminum West Virginia (which owns our curtailed Ravenswood smelter) has guaranteed our Notes due 2021, because we are in the process of selling substantially all of its assets, we have included its net assets, results of operations and cash flows in the columns under the caption Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries.

Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

This Management s Discussion and Analysis ( MD A ) provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Century Aluminum Company and its subsidiaries (collectively,  Century,  the  Company,   our  and  we ) and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto. This MD A contains  forward-looking statements  - see  Forward-Looking Statements  above. 
    
  Overview 
    
  We are a global producer of primary aluminum with aluminum reduction facilities, or "smelters," in the United States and Iceland. The key determinants of our results of operations and cash flow from operations are as follows: 

the price of primary aluminum, which is based on the LME, or other exchanges, regional delivery premiums and any value-added product premiums; 
                
    the cost of goods sold, the principal components of which are electrical power, alumina, carbon products and labor, which in aggregate exceed 75% of our cost of goods sold; and 
                
    our production volume. 
       
  Results of Operations 
  The following discussion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflects the operations at Hawesville and Mt. Holly running at approximately 40% and 50% of full capacity, respectively.   

31 

(1) 
    Excludes scrap aluminum sales. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, lower shipment volumes resulting from production curtailments announced in 2015 partially offset by the shift from toll to direct sales at Grundartangi had a negative sales impact of $88.5 million while lower price realization had a negative impact on net sales of $32.3 million. 
    
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, lower shipment volumes resulting from production curtailments announced in 2015 partially offset by the shift from toll to direct sales at Grundartangi in the third quarter of 2016 had a negative sales impact of $350.7 million while lower price realization had a negative impact on net sales of $235.9 million. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the improvement in gross profit was primarily due to favorable alumina pricing of $35.7 million and favorable plant operating results of $26.7 million partially offset by lower price realization of $32.3 million and unfavorable power prices of $8.2 million.   
    
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower price realization of $236.0 million, lower shipment volume of $19.0 million and increased depreciation expense of $5.6 million.  These factors were partially offset by favorable alumina pricing of $98.1 million, favorable power prices of $13.1 million, favorable plant operating results of $30.7 million and the impact of the labor disruption at Hawesville in 2015 of $13.1 million. 
    
  Due to the nature of our business, our inventory values are subject to market price changes and these changes can have a significant impact on cost of goods sold and gross profit in any period. On average, our inventory turns eight times within a year and reductions in net realizable value below cost basis at the end of a period will have an impact on our cost of goods sold as this inventory is sold in subsequent periods. 
  
   32 

As of September 30, 2016 the market value of our inventory was below its cost basis and we recorded a lower of cost or market ("LCM") valuation adjustment of $2.4 million as a charge to cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded an LCM valuation adjustment of $1.5 million as a charge to costs of goods sold.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded an LCM valuation adjustment and a charge to cost of goods sold of $5.3 million and $31.0 million, respectively.  The net impact of those market valuation adjustments on the 2016 and 2015 comparative results is an increase in gross profit of $2.9 million for the three month period and an increase in gross profit of $29.5 million for the nine month period.  

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased compared to the same period last year primarily due to decreases in headcount and associated employee benefits. 

At June 30, 2015, we recorded an impairment charge of   $30.9 million related to Ravenswood. At September 30, 2016, we recorded an additional impairment charge of $3.8 million and a $23.0 million charge related to a tentative agreement to settle the Ravenswood retiree medical class action lawsuit.  See    Note 3 Ravenswood impairment    and    Note 11 Commitments and contingencies    to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded unrealized gains of $1.5 and $18.3 million, respectively, on the fair value of contingent consideration related to our acquisition of Mt. Holly.  The contingent consideration was settled in March 2016 resulting in Alcoa paying us $12.5 million.  See    Note 4 Business acquisitions    to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information. 

We have a valuation allowance against all of our U.S. and certain foreign deferred tax assets.  The period to period differences in income tax expense are primarily due to the change in earnings at our foreign entities that are not subject to a valuation allowance while the entities that are subject to a valuation allowance are unable to recognize a tax benefit for their losses.  See    Note 8 Income taxes    to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Liquidity 
  Our principal sources of liquidity are available cash, cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity under our existing revolving credit facilities.  We have also raised capital in the past through the public equity and debt markets, and we regularly explore various other financing alternatives.      Our principal uses of cash include the funding of operating costs (including post-retirement benefits), maintenance of curtailed production facilities, debt service requirements, the funding of capital expenditures, investments in our growth activities and in related businesses, working capital and other general corporate requirements.   
  Available Cash 
  Our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance at   September 30, 2016   was   $117.6 million   compared to   $115.4 million   at   December 31, 2015  .   
  Sources and Uses of Cash 
  Our statements of cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are summarized below: 

Net cash provided by operating activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $15.6 million  , compared to   $32.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the $67.7 million decrease in net income partially offset by the one-time contribution to the Mt. Holly pension plan in 2015 of $34.6 million and the receipt of the contingent earn-out relating to the Mt. Holly acquisition of $12.5 million in 2016.  The remaining decrease resulted from non-cash operating activities that were partially offset by improvements in working capital. 
  Net cash used in investing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $13.4 million  , compared to   $36.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to reductions in capital expenditures of $34.4 million in 2016 partially offset by $11.3 million in proceeds received from Alcoa in April 2015 related to the Mt. Holly acquisition. 
  Net cash used in financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was zero, compared to   $36.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The change was due to repurchases of common stock of $36.4 million in the first half of 2015.  We have not repurchased any additional stock since April 2015. 
  Availability Under Our Credit Facilities 
  We and certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries are party to a senior secured revolving credit facility for our U.S. operations, dated May 24, 2013, as amended, with a syndicate of lenders which provides for borrowings of up to $150 million in the aggregate, including up to $110 million under a letter of credit sub-facility.  We have also entered into, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Nordural Grundartangi ehf, a $50 million revolving credit facility, dated November 27, 2013.  Our U.S. revolving credit facility matures in June 2020 and our Iceland revolving credit facility matures in November 2018. 
  The availability of funds under our credit facilities is limited by a specified borrowing base consisting of certain accounts receivable, inventory and qualified cash deposits.  Curtailments of production capacity decrease our borrowing base by reducing our accounts receivable and inventory balances.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our credit facilities had   $90.4 million   of net availability, after consideration of our outstanding letters of credit.   We borrow and make repayments under our credit facilities in the ordinary course based on a number of factors, including the timing of payments from our customers and  
  
   34 

payments to our suppliers.  Borrowings and repayments under our credit facilities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were insignificant.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $47.9 million   of letters of credit outstanding under our U.S. revolving credit facility with   65%   related to our domestic power commitments and the remainder securing certain debt and workers' compensation commitments. 
  Our credit facilities contain customary covenants, including restrictions on mergers and acquisitions, indebtedness, affiliate transactions, liens, dividends and distributions, dispositions of collateral, investments and prepayments of indebtedness, including, in the U.S., a springing financial covenant that requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.1 to 1.0 any time availability under the U.S. revolving credit facility is less than or equal to $15.0 million.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our fixed charge coverage ratio was less than 1.1 to 1.0; however, our availability under the U.S. credit facility was   $40.4 million  .   Our Icelandic credit facility also contains a covenant that requires Grundartangi to maintain a certain minimum equity ratio.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all such covenants. 
  Senior Secured Notes 
  We have $250 million in 7.5% senior secured notes payable that will mature on June 1, 2021.  The indenture governing the 2021 Notes contains customary covenants which may limit our ability, and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries, to: (i) incur additional debt; (ii) incur additional liens; (iii) pay dividends or make distributions in respect of capital stock; (iv) purchase or redeem capital stock; (v) make investments or certain other restricted payments; (vi) sell assets; (vii) issue or sell stock of certain subsidiaries; (viii) enter into transactions with shareholders or affiliates; and (ix) effect a consolidation or merger. 
  Acquisitions 
  On December 1, 2014, we acquired Alcoa s 50.3% stake in Mt. Holly for $67.5 million in cash subject to working capital and several other adjustments.  The acquisition was funded with available cash on hand. The purchase agreement provided for a post-closing cash payment to be made following December 31, 2015 based on changes in the Midwest Transaction Price between July 2, 2014 and December 31, 2015 and production levels at Mt. Holly from October 1, 2014 through December 31, 2015.  Alcoa paid us $12.5 million in March 2016 for this post-closing payment.  See    Note 4 Business acquisitions    to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information. 
  Contingent Commitments 
  We have a contingent obligation to E.ON which consists of the aggregate E.ON payments made to Big Rivers on CAKY s behalf in excess of the agreed upon base amount under the long-term cost-based power contract with Kenergy.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the principal and accrued interest for the E.ON contingent obligation was   $20.0 million  , which was fully offset by a derivative asset.  We may be required to make installment payments for the E.ON contingent obligation in the future.  These payments are contingent based on the LME price of primary aluminum and the level of Hawesville s operations.  Based on the LME forward market at   September 30, 2016   and management s estimate of the LME forward market beyond the quoted market period, we have assessed that we will not be required to make payments on the E.ON contingent obligation during the term of the agreement through 2028.  There can be no assurance that circumstances will not change, thus accelerating the timing of such payments. 

35 

Employee Benefit Plan Contributions 
  In April 2013, we entered into a settlement agreement with the PBGC regarding an alleged "cessation of operations" at our Ravenswood facility as a result of the curtailment of operations at the facility and, pursuant to the agreement, we agreed to make additional contributions (above any minimum required contributions) to our defined benefit pension plans totaling approximately   $17.4 million  .  The agreement permits us to defer payments during periods of lower primary aluminum prices relative to our cost of operations.  We remeasure aluminum prices against our cost of operations on an annual basis based on our fourth quarter results.  To the extent that we elect to defer one or more of these payments, we are required to provide the PBGC with acceptable security for any such deferred payments.  We made contributions pursuant to this agreement of   $1.1   million in 2015 and   $6.7   million in 2013.  We did not make any contributions during 2014 and for the nine months period ended September 30, 2016.  The remaining contributions under this agreement are approximately   $9.6 million  . 
  In addition to the contributions required pursuant to the PBGC settlement, during 2016 we expect to make aggregate contributions of $1.8 million to our qualified defined benefit plans and an unqualified supplemental executive retirement benefits plan.  Through   September 30, 2016  , we made contributions of   $1.3 million  .  
  Other items 
  During 2015, we paid Icelandic withholding taxes on intercompany dividends of approximately $8.4 million.  We anticipate these payments will be refunded in November 2016.  The withholding taxes and associated refunds are payable in Icelandic Krona ("ISK") and we are subject to foreign currency risk associated with fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared the ISK. 
  In 2011, our Board of Directors approved a $60 million common stock repurchase program which was expanded in 2015 to $130 million.  Through September 30, 2016, we expended $86.3 million under the program and repurchased 7.2 million common shares.  There have been no share repurchases since April 2015 and as of   September 30, 2016  , we had $43.7 million remaining under the repurchase program authorization.  The repurchase program may be expanded, suspended or discontinued by our Board, in its sole discretion, at any time.  
    
  As of the date of this filing, we believe we have reached a tentative agreement to settle the Ravenswood retiree medical class action lawsuit, subject to entering into a definitive written settlement agreement among the parties and obtaining approval of the court after notice to the class.  For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we recognized a $23.0 million liability in the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding expense included in Ravenswood charges in the consolidated statements of operations associated with this settlement.  The tentative agreement currently anticipates that a $5.0 million payment would be made upon the court's final approval of the settlement agreement and $2.0 million annually thereafter for nine years.  We expect to utilize cash flows from operations to fund the payments associated with this settlement.   
  In addition to the foregoing matter, we are also a defendant in several other actions relating to various aspects of our business.  While it is impossible to predict the ultimate disposition of any such litigation, we do not believe that any of these lawsuits, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  See    Note 11 Commitments and contingencies    to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information. 
  Capital Resources 
  We intend to finance our future recurring capital expenditures from available cash, cash flow from operations and available borrowing capacity under our existing revolving credit facilities.  For major investment projects we would likely seek financing from various capital and loan markets, and may potentially pursue the formation of strategic alliances.  We may be unable, however, to issue additional debt or equity securities, or enter into other financing arrangements on attractive terms, or at all, due to a number of factors including a lack of demand, unfavorable pricing, poor economic conditions, unfavorable interest rates, or our financial condition or credit rating at the time.  Future uncertainty in the U.S. and international markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity, our ability to access the debt or capital markets and our financial condition.  
  Capital expenditures for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $13.1 million  .  We estimate our total capital spending in 2016 will be approximately $20.0 to $25.0 million, primarily related to our ongoing maintenance and investment projects at our smelters.   
  We have made and may continue to make capital expenditures for the construction and development of our Helguvik project.  We have substantial future contractual commitments for the Helguvik project.  If we were to cancel the Helguvik  
  
   36 

project, we estimate that our exposure to contract cancellation and other costs would be approximately $20 million, of which we currently have accrued liabilities of approximately $12 million.  We are continuing to negotiate with the power suppliers to the project to, among other things, remove all the remaining conditions to their obligations to supply contracted power.  The timing of the power availability together with other factors will determine the timing of resumption of major construction activity at Helguvik.  We cannot, at this time, predict when the restart of major construction activity will occur, if ever. 
   
  Critical Accounting Estimates 
  Inventories 
  Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market. 
  Our estimate of the market value of our inventories involves establishing a net realizable value for both finished goods and the components of inventory that will be converted to finished goods, raw materials and work in process.  This requires management to use its judgment when making assumptions about future selling prices and the costs to complete our inventory during the period in which it will be sold. 
  Our assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties given the volatility surrounding the market price for primary aluminum sales and the market price for one of our major inputs, electrical power. 
  Although we believe that the assumptions used to estimate the market value of our inventory are reasonable, actual market conditions at the time our inventory is sold may be more or less favorable than management s current estimates. 
   
  Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.  
  Commodity Price Sensitivity 
  We are exposed to price risk for primary aluminum.  From time to time, we enter into primary aluminum forward financial contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the price of primary aluminum and to offset fixed price sales arrangements with certain of our customers.  In addition, we manage our exposure to fluctuations in our costs by purchasing certain of our alumina and power requirements under supply contracts with prices tied to the same indices as our aluminum sales contracts (the LME price of primary aluminum).  Our risk management activities do not include any trading or speculative transactions. 
  Market-Based Power Price Sensitivity 
  Market-Based Electrical Power Agreements 
  Hawesville and Sebree have market-based electrical power agreements.  Under the market-based power agreements, EDF and Kenergy purchase market-based electrical power on the open market and pass it through to Hawesville and Sebree at MISO pricing, plus transmission and other costs incurred by them.  Mt. Holly also purchases 75% of its power requirements at market prices that are tied to natural gas prices. 
  Electrical Power Price Sensitivity 
    
  With the movement toward market-based power supply agreements, we have increased our electrical power price risk for our domestic operations due to fluctuations in the price of power available on the MISO market and the price of natural gas.  Power represents our single largest operating cost, so changes in the price and/or availability of market power could significantly impact the profitability and viability of our Hawesville, Sebree and Mt. Holly operations.  Transmission line outages, problems with grid stability or limitations on energy import capability could also increase power prices, disrupt production through pot instability or force a curtailment of all or part of the production at these facilities.  In addition, indirect factors that lead to power cost increases, such as any increasing prices for natural gas or coal, fluctuations in or extremes in weather patterns or new or more stringent environmental regulations may severely impact our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. 

37 

The following table provides electrical power price sensitivity by location and assumes operating at full capacity: 

The operations at Hawesville and Mt. Holly, however, are currently running at approximately 40% and 50% of full capacity, respectively.   
  From time to time, we enter into forward contracts to mitigate the price risk associated with our power purchases.   
  Foreign Currency 
  We are exposed to foreign currency risk due to fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to the ISK, the euro, the Chinese yuan and other currencies.  Grundartangi s labor costs, part of its maintenance costs and other local services are denominated in ISK and a portion of its anode costs are denominated in euros and the Chinese yuan.  We have deposits denominated in ISK in Icelandic banks; in addition, our tax payments in Iceland for withholding taxes on intercompany dividends and estimated payments of Icelandic income taxes and any associated refunds are denominated in ISK.  As a result, an increase or decrease in the value of those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would affect Grundartangi s net income.    We may incur additional capital expenditures for the construction of the Helguvik project, although we continue to evaluate the Helguvik project s cost, scope and schedule.  Upon a restart of major construction for the Helguvik project, we have forecasted that a significant portion of the capital expenditures would be denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, with significant portions in ISK, euros and Swiss francs.   
  From time to time, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts or option contracts for forecasted transactions and projected cash flows for foreign currencies in future periods in order to manage our exposure to foreign currency risk. 
  Natural Economic Hedges 
  Any analysis of our exposure to the commodity price of aluminum should consider the impact of natural hedges provided by certain contracts that contain pricing indexed to the LME price for primary aluminum.  Certain of our alumina contracts, as well as certain of Grundartangi s electrical power contracts, are indexed to the LME price for primary aluminum and provide a natural hedge for a portion of our production.  
  Risk Management 
  Any metals, power, natural gas and foreign currency risk management activities are subject to the control and direction of senior management within guidelines established by Century s Board of Directors.  These activities are regularly reported to Century s Board of Directors. 
  
   38 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures. 
  a.  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures.  Based upon that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  b.  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

39 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1.  Legal Proceedings. 
  We are a party from time to time in various legal actions arising in the normal course of business, the outcomes of which, in the opinion of management, neither individually nor in the aggregate are likely to result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  For information regarding legal proceedings pending against us at   September 30, 2016  , refer to    Note 11 Commitments and contingencies    to the consolidated financial statements included herein. 
   
  Item 1A.  Risk Factors. 
  There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed under the heading  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  . You should carefully consider the risk factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other information set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should be aware that these risk factors and other information may not describe every risk facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 
   
  Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.  
  None. 

40 

Item 5.  Other Information 
  Disclosure pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act  
  Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 ( ITRA ), effective August 10, 2012, added a new subsection (r) to Section 13 of the Exchange Act, which requires issuers that file periodic reports with the SEC to disclose in their annual and quarterly reports whether, during the reporting period, they or any of their  affiliates  (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) have knowingly engaged in specified activities or transactions relating to Iran, including activities not prohibited by U.S. law and conducted outside the U.S. by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with applicable laws.  Issuers must also file a notice with the SEC if any disclosable activity under ITRA has been included in an annual or quarterly report.  
  Because the SEC defines the term  affiliate  broadly, our largest stockholder may be considered an affiliate of the Company despite the fact that the Company has no control over its largest stockholder s actions or the actions of its affiliates.  As such, pursuant to Section 13(r)(1)(D)(iii) of the Exchange Act, the Company hereby discloses the following information provided by our largest stockholder regarding transactions or dealings with entities controlled by the Government of Iran ( the GOI ): 
  During the third quarter of 2016, non-U.S. affiliates of the largest stockholder of the Company ( the non-U.S. Stockholder Affiliates ) entered into sales and purchase contracts for agricultural products, metals, minerals, oil and oil products with, or for delivery to or from Iranian entities wholly or majority owned by the GOI. The non-U.S. Stockholder Affiliates performed their obligations under the contracts in compliance with applicable sanction laws and, where required, with the necessary prior approvals by the relevant governmental authorities. 
  The gross revenue of the non-U.S. Stockholder Affiliates related to the contracts did not exceed the value of USD $334.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  
  At the same time as providing this information to us, the non-U.S. Stockholder Affiliates amended the information that it provided us for the second quarter of 2016 to state that the gross revenue of the non-U.S. Stockholder Affiliates related to these contracts did not exceed the value of the USD $254 million for the second quarter of 2016 compared to the USD $253 million previously reported. 
  The non-U.S. Stockholder Affiliates do not allocate net profit on a country-by-country or activity-by-activity basis, but estimate that the net profit attributable to the contracts would not exceed a small fraction of the gross revenue from such contracts. It is not possible to determine accurately the precise net profit attributable to such contracts. 
  The contracts disclosed above do not violate applicable sanctions laws administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control, and are not the subject of any enforcement action under Iran sanction laws. 
  In compliance with applicable economic sanctions and in conformity with US secondary sanctions, the non-U.S. Stockholder Affiliates expect to continue to engage in similar activities in the future.  
  The Company and its global subsidiaries had no transactions or activities requiring disclosure under ITRA, nor were we involved in the transactions described in this section.  As of the date of this report, the Company is not aware of any other activity, transaction or dealing by it or any of its affiliates during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that requires disclosure in this report under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act.

  I, Rick T. Dillon, certify that: 
    
           1) 
     I have reviewed this   quarterly   report on Form   10-Q   of Century Aluminum Company; 
              2) 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3) 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4) 
    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and

    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5) 
    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
