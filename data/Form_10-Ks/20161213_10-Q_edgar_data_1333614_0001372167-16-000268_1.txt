  (a Nevada Corporation)  

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  

  October 31, 2016  

  (Unaudited)  

  (Expressed in U.S. Dollars)  

NOTE 1. BUSINESS OPERATIONS  

You Han Data Tech Company Ltd. (the  Company )
was incorporated on February 23, 2001 under the Company Act of the State of Nevada, U.S.A., to pursue mineral exploration. The
inception date is February 15, 2002 and the fiscal year end of the Company is April 30. 

 On February 9, 2010, the Company entered into a share exchange
agreement with Compania Minera Cerros Del Sur, S.A. ( Compania Minera ), a Honduran corporation, and a shareholder
of Compania Minera. The closing of the transactions contemplated in the share exchange agreement and the acquisition of 99% of
the issued and outstanding common stock in the capital of Compania Minera occurred on February 9, 2010. In accordance with the
closing of the share exchange agreement, the Company issued 35,500,000 shares of its common stock to a former stockholder of Compania
Minera in exchange for the acquisition, by the Company, of 99% of the issued and outstanding shares of Compania Minera. Also, pursuant
to the terms of the share exchange agreement, certain stockholders of the Company cancelled 34,000,000 restricted shares of the
Company s common stock. 

 Compania Minera was organized on October 2, 1975 and recorded
in the Honduran commerce register under number 1091-275, as a variable equity   Limited Liability Company for an undefined
period of time, in accordance with Honduran law. On August 12, 2004, Compania Minera became into a variable equity  Joint-Stock
company and recorded in the Honduran commerce register under number 98-566. Compania Minera is based in Tegucigalpa and its major
activity is the mining prospecting, exploring, exploding and commercialization and other related commercial activities. 

 You Han Data Tech Company Ltd. (the Company) has received
notification that the Company is in default of its Amended Stock Exchange Agreement (the Agreement) dated November 26, 2010 between
the Company, Compania Minera Cerros Del Sur S.A. (Cerros) and Mayan Gold, Inc. (Mayan). The Company was not successful in its efforts
to raise the necessary funds as stipulated in the Agreement and therefore the Company is technically in default with Cerros and
Mayan. In the event of a termination of the Agreement, the Company will effectively lose the majority of its ownership of the Clavo
Rico mine which is the only asset of the Company. The Company is currently in discussions with Mayan and Cerros to renegotiate
this matter. There can be no assurances the Company will be successful in retaining its ownership of the asset. 

 On March 4, 2016, the Company changes its name from Razor
Resources, Inc. to You Han Data Tech Company Ltd. 

Going Concern 

 These financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which assume that the
Company will realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred losses
since inception of $1,443,828 to October 31, 2016. This factor creates doubt as to the ability of the Company to continue as a
going concern. Realization values may be substantially different from the carrying values as shown in these financial statements
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Management is in the process of identifying sources for additional
financing for working capital and to fund the ongoing development of the Company's business, and management proposes to develop
plans to continue the business as a going concern. 

 The sole officer and director are involved in other business
activities and may, in the future, become involved in other business opportunities. If a specific business opportunity becomes
available, such persons may face a conflict in selecting between the Company and their other business interests. The Company has
not formulated a policy for the resolution of such conflicts. 

NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

 (a) Basis of Presentation 

 The accompanying consolidated financial statements for You
Han Data Tech Company Ltd. have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (US GAAP).  

(b) Use of Estimates 

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount of property,
plant and equipment, valuation allowances for receivables and deferred income tax assets and reclamation of mine. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. 

 (c) Bank Indebtedness 

 Bank indebtedness consists of overdraft with the Company s
Banker. (e) Income Taxes 

 Provisions for income taxes are based on taxes payable or
refundable for the current year and deferred taxes arising on tax losses and temporary differences between the tax bases of assets
and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are included in the
financial statement at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities
are expected to be realized or settled as prescribed in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) No. 740,  Income
Taxes  ( ASC No. 740 ). As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
adjusted through the provision for income taxes. 

 (d) Loss per Share 

 The Company follows ASC No. 260,  Earnings per Share  that
requires the reporting of both basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income
available to common shareowners by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per
share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or
converted into common stock. In accordance with ASC No, 260, any anti-dilutive effects on net loss per share are excluded. 

 (e) Foreign Currency Translation 

 The Company s functional and reporting currency is
the United States dollar. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated in accordance with ASC
No. 830 Foreign Currency Matters, using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Gains and losses arising on settlement
of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included in the determination of income. The Company has not to the
date of these financial statements, entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. 

 The Company translates its foreign operations  assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars at current rates of exchange as of the balance sheet date and
income and expense items at the average exchange rate for the reporting period. Translation adjustments resulting from exchange
rate fluctuations are recorded in the cumulative translation account, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains
or losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other expense (income), net. 

 (f) Comprehensive Income 

 Comprehensive income reflects changes in equity that results
from transactions and economic events from non-owner sources. 

(g) Disclosure about fair value of financial instruments 

 The Company follow paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and has adopted paragraph 820-10-35-37 of
the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( Paragraph 820-10-35-37 ) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments.
Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing generally accepted accounting principles
that require the use of fair value measurements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosure about
such fair value measurements. The adoption of Paragraph 820-10-35-37 did not have an impact on the Company s financial position
or operating results, but did expand certain disclosures. 

 Paragraph 820-10-35-37 defines fair value as the price that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. Additionally, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable
inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below: 

Level 1:  
      Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   
 
      Level 2:  
      Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data   
 
      Level 3:  
      Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting entity s own assumptions   
 
 The Company has financial instruments, none of which are held
for trading purposes. The Company estimates that the fair value of financial instruments at April 30, 2015 such as cash on hand,
accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, accounts payable to related companies and other accounts payable
does not differ materially from the aggregate carrying values of its financial instruments recorded in the accompanying balance
sheet because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. The fair value of the loan from director cannot be determined because
it is non-interest bearing and the absence of market data. 

 The estimated fair value amounts have been determined by
the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is required in interpreting
market data to develop the estimates of fair value, and accordingly, the estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts
that the Company could realize in a current market exchange. 

 (h) Concentration of credit risk 

 Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company
to a significant concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash on hand and accounts receivable which are not collateralized.
The Company limits its exposure to credit loss by placing its cash and cash equivalents with high credit quality financial institutions
and by performing regular credit assessments of its customers and providing allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable based
on the credit risk applicable to particular customer. 

 (j) Inventory 

 Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable
value. Cost is determined under the weighted average cost method. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary
course of business less estimated costs of completion and estimated selling costs. Cost of inventories includes precious metals,
materials and supplies. 

 Inventories are written down to net realizable value when
the cost of inventories is not estimated to be recoverable. 

 (k) Property, plant and equipment 

 Property includes land and mineral property (see Mineral
property acquisition costs and deferred exploration expenditures). Plant and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation
and is comprised of mining-machinery, vehicles, office equipment and furniture, leasehold and website cost. Office furniture and
equipment are amortized at 10%, and website costs are amortized at 30%. All other equipment is being amortized on a straight line
basis over 5 to 20 years. 

 (l) Mineral property acquisition costs and deferred exploration
expenditures 

 Mineral property acquisition costs are initially capitalized.
Exploration costs and mine development costs to be incurred, including those to be incurred in advance of commercial production
and those incurred to expand capacity of proposed mines, are expensed as incurred while the Company is in the exploration stage.
Mine development costs to be incurred to maintain production will be expensed as incurred. Depletion and amortization expense related
to capitalized mineral properties and mine development costs will be computed using the units-of-production method based on proved
and probable reserves. 

 a. US GAAP requires that whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, the entity shall estimate the future cash flows expected to result from
the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the discounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount
of the asset, an impairment loss (difference between the carrying amount and fair value) should be recognized as a component of
income from continuing operations before income taxes. 

b. Where properties are disposed of, the sale proceeds are,
firstly, applied as a recovery of mineral property acquisition costs, and secondly, as a gain or loss recorded in current operations. 

 (m) Asset retirement obligations 

 ASC No, 410, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the
associated asset retirement costs. Specifically, ASC No. 410 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. In addition,
the asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the asset s carrying value and subsequently allocated to expense over
the asset s useful life. 

 (n) Revenue Recognition 

 The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting
Standards Codification ( ASC ) No. 605,  Revenue Recognition  ( ASC No. 605 ). ASC No. 605 requires
that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery
has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably
assured. 

 Revenue is recognized on the sale and delivery of precious
metals and transfer of title to the customers or the completion of a service provided and when collection is reasonably assumed. 

 (o) Impairment 

 ASC No. 360, Property, plant and equipment, requires that
long-lived assets to be held and used be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. 

 Determination of recoverability is based on the Company's
judgment and estimates of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. Measurement
of an impairment loss for long-lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the assets. 

 The carrying values of assets determined to be impaired are
reduced to their estimated fair values. Fair values of any impaired assets would generally be determined using a market or income
approach. 

 (p) Recent accounting pronouncements 

Impact of New Accounting Standards 

The Company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting
pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position, or cash flow. 

NOTE 3. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT  

NOTE 4. CAPITAL STOCK  

 a) Stock and Option Compensation Plan 

 On April 19, 2010, the Company approved a stock and option

 b) Issued and Outstanding 

 During the year ended April 30, 2008, the Company s
Board of Directors approved a 15 for one (1) forward stock split of our authorized, issued and outstanding shares of capital stock.
The authorized capital increased from 70,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 to 1,050,000,000 shares of common

that the current level of cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve month period. In the event
that additional funds are required to maintain operations, our officers and directors have agreed to advance us sufficient capital
to allow us to continue operations. We may also be able to obtain loans from our shareholders, but there are no agreements or understandings

business and ensure its future profitability. We anticipate that any additional funding will be in the form of equity financing
