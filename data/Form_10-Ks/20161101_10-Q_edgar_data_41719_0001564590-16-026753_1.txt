     NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (unaudited) 

1.   
 
       ORGANIZATION    
 P. H. Glatfelter Company and subsidiaries ( Glatfelter ) is a manufacturer of specialty papers and fiber-based engineered materials. Headquartered in York, PA, U.S. operations include facilities in Spring Grove, PA and Chillicothe and Fremont, OH. International operations include facilities in Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and the Philippines, and sales and distribution offices in Russia and China. The terms  we,   us,   our,   the Company,  or  Glatfelter,  refer to P. H. Glatfelter Company and subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise. Our products are marketed worldwide, either through wholesale paper merchants, brokers and agents, or directly to customers.  

2.   
 
     ACCOUNTING POLICIES    
 Basis of Presentation  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements ( financial statements ) include the accounts of Glatfelter and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  
 We prepared these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( generally accepted accounting principles  or  GAAP ) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission pertaining to interim financial statements. In our opinion, the financial statements reflect all normal, recurring adjustments needed to present fairly our results for the interim periods. When preparing these financial statements, we have assumed that you have read the audited consolidated financial statements included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Accounting Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingencies as of the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management believes the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of these financial statements are reasonable, based upon currently available facts and known circumstances, but recognizes that actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions.  
   Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-09,   Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718) Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting     designed to simplify certain aspects of accounting for share-  

based awards. The new ASU requires entities to recognize as a component of income tax expense all excess tax benefits or deficiencies arising from the difference between compensation costs recognized and the intrinsic value at the time an option is exercised or, in the case of restricted stock and similar awards, the fair value upon vesting of an award. Previously such differences were recognized in additional paid in capital as part of an  APIC pool.  In addition, the ASU also requires entities to exclude excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies from the calculation of common share equivalents for purposes of calculating earnings per share. The new standard is required to be adopted, either prospectively or retrospectively, in the first quarter of 2017 and early adoption is permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial position.  
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . This ASU will require organizations such as us that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The new guidance will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. We are in the process of assessing the impact this standard will have on us and expect to follow a modified retrospective method provided for under the standard. 
 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  which clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common revenue standard for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The new standard is required to be adopted retrospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted only for reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2016. We are in the process of evaluating the impact this standard may have, if any, on our reported results of operations or financial position. 
 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13  Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  that changes the impairment model for most financial instruments, including trade receivables from an incurred loss method to a new forward-looking approach, based on expected losses. Under the new guidance, an allowance is recognized based on an estimate of expected credit losses. This standard is effective for us in the first quarter of 2020 and must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition approach. We are currently assessing the impact this standard may have on our results of operations and financial position.

          INCO  ME TAXES     
 Income taxes are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. The effects of income taxes are measured based on enacted tax laws and rates. 
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $15.2 million and $12.2 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits. As of September 30, 2016, if such benefits were to be recognized, approximately $12.2 million would be recorded as a component of income tax expense, thereby affecting our effective tax rate. 
 We, or one of our subsidiaries, file income tax returns with the United States Internal Revenue Service, as well as various state and foreign authorities. 
 The following table summarizes, by major jurisdiction, tax years that remain subject to examination: 

(1)   
 
 includes provincial or similar local jurisdictions, as applicable    
 The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrues amounts for uncertain tax positions. Based on these reviews and the result of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities and the closure of tax years subject to tax audit, reserves are adjusted as necessary. However, future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are determined or resolved or as such statutes are closed. Due to potential for resolution of federal, state and foreign examinations, and the lapse of various statutes of limitation, it is reasonably possible our gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may decrease within the next twelve months by a range of zero to $1.8 million. Substantially all of this range relates to tax positions taken in Germany. 

We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. The following table summarizes information related to interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions: 

6.   STOCK-BASED  COMPENSATION 
 The P. H. Glatfelter Amended and Restated Long Term Incentive Plan (the  LTIP ) provides for the issuance of Glatfelter common stock to eligible participants in the form of restricted stock units, restricted stock awards, non-qualified stock options, performance shares, incentive stock options and performance units. 
 Pursuant to terms of the LTIP, we have issued to eligible participants restricted stock units, performance share awards and stock only stock appreciation rights. 
 Restricted Stock Units ( RSU ) and Performance Share Awards ( PSAs )  Awards of RSUs and PSAs are made under our LTIP. The RSUs vest on the passage of time, generally on a graded scale over a three, four, and five-year period, or in certain instances the RSUs were issued with five year cliff vesting. PSAs are issued annually to members of management and each respective grant cliff vests each December 31 of the third year following the grant, assuming the achievement of predetermined, cumulative financial performance targets covering two or three year periods. The performance measures include a minimum, target and maximum performance level providing the grantees an opportunity to receive more or less shares than targeted depending on actual financial performance. For both RSUs and PSAs, the grant date fair value of the awards, which is equal to the closing price per common share on the date of the award, is used to determine the amount of expense to be recognized over the applicable service period. Settlement of RSUs and PSAs will be made in shares of our common stock currently held in treasury.

Stock Only Stock Appreciation Rights ( SOSARs )  Under terms of the SOSAR, a recipient receives the right to a payment in the form of shares of common stock equal to the difference, if any, in the fair market value of one share of common stock at the time of exercising the SOSAR and the exercise price. The SOSARs vest ratably over a three year period and have a term of ten years.

     LONG-TERM DEBT    
 Long-term debt is summarized as follows: 

The amount set forth for Long-term debt, net of current portion as of December 31, 2015, has been restated to retroactively adopt ASU No. 2015-03,  Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs . This ASU requires debt issuance costs to be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the related debt instrument rather than as a deferred asset except for costs associated with a revolving line of credit. We adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2016 retroactive to December 31, 2015. 
 On March 12, 2015, we amended our revolving credit agreement with a consortium of banks (the  Revolving Credit Facility ) which increased the amount available for borrowing to $400 million, extended the maturity of the facility to March 12, 2020, and instituted a revised interest rate pricing grid. 
     For all US dollar denominated borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, the borrowing rate is, at our option, either, (a) the bank s base rate which is equal to the greater of i) the prime rate; ii) the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points; or iii) the daily Euro-rate plus 100 basis points plus an applicable spread over either i), ii) or iii) ranging from 12.5 basis points to 100 basis points based on the Company s leverage ratio and its corporate credit ratings determined by Standard   Poor s Rating Services and Moody s Investor Service, Inc. (the  Corporate Credit Rating  or (b) the daily  

Euro-rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 112.5 basis points to 200 basis points based on the Company s leverage ratio and the Corporate Credit Rating. For non-US dollar denominated borrowings, interest is based on (b) above. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility contains a number of customary covenants for financings of this type that, among other things, restrict our ability to dispose of or create liens on assets, incur additional indebtedness, repay other indebtedness, limits certain intercompany financing arrangements, make acquisitions and engage in mergers or consolidations. We are also required to comply with specified financial tests and ratios including: i) maximum net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) ratio (the  leverage ratio  and ii) a consolidated EBITDA to interest expense ratio. The most restrictive of our covenants is a maximum leverage ratio of 3.5x. As of September 30, 2016, the leverage ratio, as calculated in accordance with the definition in our credit agreement, was 2.1x. A breach of these requirements would give rise to certain remedies under the Revolving Credit Facility, among which are the termination of the agreement and accelerated repayment of the outstanding borrowings plus accrued and unpaid interest under the credit facility. 
 On October 3, 2012, we completed a private placement offering of $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.375% Senior Notes due 2020 (the  5.375% Notes ). The 5.375% Notes, which are now publically registered, are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by PHG Tea Leaves, Inc., Mollanvick, Inc., Glatfelter Composite Fibers N. A., Inc., Glatfelter Advanced Materials N.A., LLC., and Glatfelter Holdings, LLC (the  Guarantors ). Interest on the 5.375% Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on April 15 and October 15. 
 The 5.375% Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time on or after October 15, 2016 at the redemption prices specified in the applicable Indenture. These Notes and the guarantees of the notes are senior obligations of the Company and the Guarantors, respectively, rank equally in right of payment with future senior indebtedness of the Company and the Guarantors and will mature on October 15, 2020. 
 The 5.375% Notes contain various covenants customary to indebtedness of this nature including limitations on i) the amount of indebtedness that may be incurred; ii) certain restricted payments including common stock dividends; iii) distributions from certain subsidiaries; iv) sales of assets; v) transactions amongst subsidiaries; and vi) incurrence of liens on assets. In addition, the 5.375% Notes contain cross default provisions that could result in all such notes becoming due and payable in the event of a failure to repay debt outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement at maturity or a default under the Revolving Credit Agreement that accelerates the debt outstanding thereunder. As of September 30, 2016, we met all of the requirements of our debt covenants.

 GLATFELTER  
 9.30.16 Form 10-Q  

Glatfelter Gernsbach GmbH   Co. KG ( Gernsbach ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, entered into a series of borrowing agreements with IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, D sseldorf ( IKB ) as summarized below: 

Each of the borrowings require quarterly repayments of principal and interest and provide for representations, warranties and covenants customary for financings of these types. The financial covenants contained in each of the IKB loans, which relate to the minimum ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense and the maximum ratio of consolidated total net debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA, are calculated by reference to our Revolving Credit Agreement. 
 P. H. Glatfelter Company guarantees all debt obligations of its subsidiaries. All such obligations are recorded in these condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Letters of credit issued to us by certain financial institutions totaled $5.1 million and $5.3 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The letters of credit, which reduce amounts available under our revolving credit facility, primarily provide financial assurances for the benefit of certain state workers compensation insurance agencies in conjunction with our self-insurance program. We bear the credit risk on this amount to the extent that we do not comply with the provisions of certain agreements. No amounts are outstanding under the letters of credit. 

10.   
 
       FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS    
 The amounts reported on the condensed consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value. The following table sets forth carrying value and fair value of long-term debt: 

As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, we had $250.0 million of 5.375% fixed rate bonds. These bonds are publicly registered, but thinly traded. Accordingly, the values set forth above for the bonds, as well as our other debt instruments, are based on observable inputs and other relevant market data (Level 2). The fair value of financial derivatives is set forth below in Note 11. 

11.   
 
     FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES    
 As part of our overall risk management practices, we enter into financial derivatives primarily designed to either i) hedge foreign currency risks associated with forecasted transactions    cash flow hedges  or ii) mitigate the impact that changes in currency exchange rates have on intercompany financing transactions and foreign currency denominated receivables and payables    foreign currency hedges." 
 Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments - Cash Flow Hedges  We use currency forward contracts as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the currency exchange rates on certain forecasted production costs or capital expenditures expected to be incurred. Currency forward contracts involve fixing the exchange for delivery of a specified amount of foreign currency on a specified date. As of September 30, 2016, the maturity of currency forward contracts ranged from one month to 22 months.  
   We designate certain currency forward contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted raw material purchases, certain production costs or capital expenditures with exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of foreign exchange risk is deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. With respect to hedges of forecasted raw material purchases or production costs, the  

- 13 -  
 GLATFELTER  
 9.30.16 Form 10-Q  

amount deferred is subsequently reclassified into costs of products sold in the period that inventory produced using the hedged transaction affects earnings. For hedged capital expenditures, deferred gains or losses are reclassified and included in the historical cost of the capital asset and subsequently affect earnings as depreciation is recognized. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized directly to earnings and reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income as non-operating income (expense) under the caption  Other, net.  
 We had the following outstanding derivatives that were used to hedge foreign exchange risks associated with forecasted transactions and designated as hedging instruments: 

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments - Foreign Currency Hedges  We also enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the impact changes in currency exchange rates have on balance sheet monetary assets and liabilities. None of these contracts are designated as hedges for financial accounting purposes and, accordingly, changes in value of the foreign exchange forward contracts and in the offsetting underlying on-balance-sheet transactions are reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income under the caption  Other, net.   
 The following sets forth derivatives used to mitigate the impact changes in currency exchange rates have on balance sheet monetary assets and liabilities: 

These contracts have maturities of one month from the date originally entered into. 

Fair Value Measurements  The following table summarizes the fair values of derivative instruments for the period indicated and the line items in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets where the instruments are recorded:  

The amounts set forth in the table above represent the net asset or liability giving effect to rights of offset with each counterparty. The effect of netting the amounts presented above did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position. 
 The following table summarizes the amount of income or (loss) from derivative instruments recognized in our results of operations for the periods indicated and the line items in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income where the results are recorded: 

The impact of activity not designated as hedging was substantially all offset by the remeasurement of the underlying on-balance-sheet item. 
 The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).

The fair values of the foreign exchange forward contracts are considered to be Level 2. Foreign currency forward contracts are valued using foreign currency forward and interest rate curves. The fair value of each contract is determined by comparing the contract rate to the forward rate and discounting to present value. Contracts in a gain position are recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheets under the caption  Prepaid expenses and other current assets  and the value of contracts in a loss position is recorded under the caption  Other current liabilities.  
 A rollforward of fair value amounts recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is as follows: 

We expect substantially all of the amounts recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income will be recorded as a component of the capital asset or realized in results of operations within the next twelve to twenty-two months and the amount ultimately recognized will vary depending on actual market rates. 
 Credit risk related to derivative activity arises in the event the counterparty fails to meet its obligations to us. This exposure is generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparty s obligations exceed our obligation to them. Our policy is to enter into contracts only with financial institutions which meet certain minimum credit ratings.

     COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS    
 Fox River - Neenah, Wisconsin 
 Background.  We have significant uncertainties associated with environmental claims arising out of the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) in sediments in the lower Fox River, on which our former Neenah facility was located, and in the Bay of Green Bay Wisconsin (collectively, the  Site ). Since the early 1990s, the United States, the State of Wisconsin and two Indian tribes (collectively, the  Governments ) have pursued a cleanup of a 39-mile stretch of river from Little Lake Butte des Morts into Green Bay and natural resource damages ( NRDs ).  
     The United States notified the following parties ( PRPs ) of their potential responsibility to implement response actions, to pay response costs, and to compensate for NRDs at this site: us, Appvion, Inc. (formerly known as Appleton Papers Inc.), CBC Coating, Inc. (formerly known as Riverside Paper  

Corporation), Georgia-Pacific Consumer Products, L.P. ( Georgia-Pacific , formerly known as Fort James Operating Company), Menasha Corporation, NCR Corporation ( NCR ), U.S. Paper Mills Corp., and WTM I Company. As described below, many other parties have been joined in litigation. After giving effect to settlements reached with the Governments, the remaining PRPs exposed to continuing obligations to implement the remainder of the cleanup consist of us, Georgia-Pacific and NCR. 
 The Site has been subject to certain studies and the parties conducted certain demonstration projects and completed certain interim cleanups. The permanent cleanup, known as a  remedial action  under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ( CERCLA  or  Superfund ), consists of sediment dredging, installation of engineered caps, and placement of sand covers in various areas in the bed of the river. 
 The United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) has divided the Site into five  operable units , including the most upstream portion of the Site on which our facility was located ( OU1 ) and four downstream reaches of the river and bay ( OU2-5 ). 
 We and WTM I Company implemented the remedial action in OU1 under a consent decree with the Governments; Menasha Corporation made a financial contribution to that work. That project began in 2004 and the work is complete other than on-going monitoring and maintenance. 
 For OU2-5, work has proceeded primarily under a Unilateral Administrative Order ( UAO ) issued in November 2007 by the EPA to us and seven other respondents. The remedial actions from 2007 through 2014 were funded primarily by NCR and its indemnitors, including Appvion, Inc. In 2015, we placed certain covering and capping in OU4b as a response to the Government s demands at a cost of $9.7 million. Georgia Pacific and NCR funded work in 2015 pursuant to a proposed consent decree not entered by the court until May 10, 2016. Work is scheduled to continue in OU2-5 through at least 2018, with monitoring and maintenance to follow. 
 As more fully discussed below, significant uncertainties exist pertaining to the ultimate allocation of OU2-5 remediation costs as well as the shorter term funding of the remedial actions for OU2-5. 
   Cost estimates.  Estimates of the Site remediation change over time as we, or others, gain additional data and experience at the Site. In addition, disagreement exists over the likely costs for some of this work. On October 14, 2014, the Governments represented to the United States District Court in Green Bay that $1.1 billion provided an  upper end estimate of total past and future response costs  including a $100 million  uncertainty premium for future response costs.    

- 15 -  
 GLATFELTER  
 9.30.16 Form 10-Q  

Based upon estimates made by the Governments and independent estimates commissioned by various potentially responsible parties, we have no reason to disagree with the Governments  assertion. Much of that amount has already been incurred, including approximately $100 million for OU1 and what we believe to be approximately $575 million for OU2-5 prior to the 2016 remediation season.  
 In 2016, the Governments again seek approximately $100 million of work to be completed in OU2-5. The exact work and a more precise estimate of its cost depend on certain unresolved technical issues. During 2016, we placed the final layer on certain caps at a cost of approximately $4 million.     
 Allocation Litigation.  In January 2008, NCR and Appvion brought an action in the federal district court in Green Bay to allocate among all parties responsible for this Site all of the costs incurred by the Governments, all of the costs incurred by the parties, and all of the NRDs owed to the Natural Resource Trustees. We have previously referred to this case as the  Whiting Litigation.  After several summary judgment rulings and a trial, the trial court entered judgment in the Whiting Litigation allocating to NCR 100% of the costs of (a) the OU2-5 cleanup, (b) NRDs, (c) past and future costs incurred by the Governments in OU2-5, and (d) past and future costs incurred by any of the other parties net of an appropriate equitable adjustment for insurance recoveries. As to Glatfelter, NCR was judged liable to us for $4.28 million and any future costs or damages we may incur. NCR was held not responsible for costs incurred in OU1.  
 All parties appealed the Whiting Litigation judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. On September 25, 2014, that court affirmed, holding that if knowledge and fault were the only equitable factors governing allocation of costs and NRDs at the Site, NCR would owe 100% of all costs and damages in OU2-5, but would not have a share of costs in OU1 -- which is upstream of the outfall of the facilities for which NCR is responsible -- solely as an  arranger for disposal  of PCB-containing waste paper by recycling it at our mill. However, the court of appeals vacated the judgment and remanded the case for the district court s further consideration of whether any other equitable factors might cause the district court to alter its allocation. 
 We contend the district court should, after further consideration, reinstate the 100%, or some similar very high, allocation to NCR of all the costs, and should hold that we should bear no share or a very small share. However, NCR has taken a contrary position and has sought contributions from others for future work until all allocation issues are resolved. 
     In addition, we take the position that the  single site  theory on which the courts held us responsible for cleaning up parts of the Site far downstream of our former mill should, if applied to NCR, make it liable for costs incurred in OU1. The district court agreed with us in an order dated March 3, 2015.  

On March 31, 2015, NCR sought review of that order by the court of appeals which review was denied on May 1, 2015. 
 Appvion and NCR have had a cost-sharing agreement since at least 1998. The court of appeals held if Appvion incurred any recoverable costs because the Governments had named Appvion as a potentially responsible party, then Appvion may have a right to recover those costs under CERCLA. We and Appvion disagree over what being named a PRP means and the proper treatment of amounts that Appvion incurred while a PRP that were also subject to a cost-sharing agreement with NCR; we contend Appvion may not recover costs it was contractually obligated to incur, that it has no other costs, and if it did, we would have a right to contribution of any recovery against NCR and others. However, Appvion takes a contrary position and claims approximately $200 million. 
 The district court has established a schedule for the Whiting Litigation under which it would hold a trial beginning in March 2017 on remaining issues. 
 Enforcement Litigation.  In October 2010, the United States and the State of Wisconsin brought an action ( Government Action ) in the federal district court in Green Bay against us and 13 other defendants seeking (a) to recover all of the United States  and the State of Wisconsin s unreimbursed past costs, (b) to obtain a declaration of joint and several liability for all of their future costs, (c) to recover NRDs, and (d) to obtain a declaration of liability of all of the respondents on the UAO to perform the remedy in OU2-5 as required by the UAO and a mandatory permanent injunction to the same effect. The last of these claims was tried in 2012, and in May 2013, the district court enjoined us, NCR, WTM I, and Menasha Corp. to perform the work under the UAO. As the result of partial settlements, U.S. Paper Mills Corp. and Georgia-Pacific Consumer Products L.P. agreed to joint and several liability for some of the work. Appvion was held not liable for this Site under CERCLA.  
 All other potentially responsible parties, including the United States and the State of Wisconsin, have settled with the Governments. As a result, the remaining defendants consist of us, NCR, and Georgia-Pacific. 
 We appealed the injunction to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, as did NCR, WTM I, and Menasha. On September 25, 2014, the court of appeals decided our and NCR s appeals; the others  appeals were not decided because they entered into a settlement. The court of appeals vacated the injunction as to us and NCR. However, it affirmed the district court s ruling that we are liable for response actions in OU2-5 and for complying with the UAO. The court of appeals vacated and remanded the district court s decision that NCR had failed to prove that liability for OU2-5 could be apportioned, directing the lower court to consider issues it had not considered initially. 

- 16 -  
 GLATFELTER  
 9.30.16 Form 10-Q  

On remand, the district court issued an opinion on October 19, 2015, holding that NCR had not shown a reasonable basis for apportionment of its liability for the site. On January 25, 2016, the court denied NCR s request to certify that decision for immediate appeal. 
 As described below, the United States has withdrawn its natural resources damages claim against us. The Governments  remaining claims principally consist of claims for (1) unreimbursed past costs of the United States totaling $35.1 million (as incurred through September 30, 2015),  and (2) costs incurred and/or to be incurred by the United States after September 30, 2015 and by the State of Wisconsin after June 30, 2015 in excess of about $4.7 million, respectively. The remaining issues in the Government Action are set for trial to commence after the conclusion of the 2017 trial in the Whiting Litigation. 
 Interim Funding of Ongoing Work.  As described above, the court of appeals vacated the allocation judgment in the Whiting Litigation on September 25, 2014, but neither court has since replaced that allocation with any other. The 2007 UAO requires the PRPs to submit annual remediation work plans. For 2015, the EPA approved the 2015 Work Plan for $100 million of remediation activities. NCR, GP, and we were not able to reach agreement on a division of the costs of that work on an interim basis, subject to reallocation in the Whiting Litigation. NCR and GP entered into a proposed consent decree with the United States under which they agreed to fund certain work estimated to cost approximately $67 million in 2015, and they would not be responsible for completing the remainder of the work in 2015, estimated to cost approximately $33 million. However, NCR and GP did not complete all of the work assigned to them under the consent decree. The United States did not move to enter that consent decree until April 12, 2016, and the court did not enter that decree until May 10, 2016. Through the issuance of the 2015 Work Plan the EPA assigned to us those remaining tasks. Under the proposed consent decree, all parties would remain jointly and severally liable for work in the 2015 Work Plan not completed in 2015, except for a small amount of work upstream of the area for which GP is responsible. We contracted for remediation work in OU4 at a total cost of $9.7 million, an amount of work less than the amount assigned to us in the 2015 Work Plan. We anticipate that the amount of work performed by us in 2015 satisfied our share of the obligation if NCR and GP had performed the work assigned to them in the 2015 Work Plan. The United States disagrees. We cannot predict the outcome of these disagreements or any possible resulting litigation.  
     The 2016 Work Plan similarly calls for completion of work that is estimated to cost in the range of $100 million. However, unlike the 2015 Work Plan, it does not allocate the work among NCR, GP, and us. The parties have again not come to agreement on an interim allocation among them of responsibility for completing the work called for by the 2016  

Work Plan. NCR and GP have begun certain work. We have completed the placement of certain capping material. 
 Because we may not be able to obtain an agreement with the other parties or a ruling in litigation defining our obligation to contribute to work in any given year prior to the time that work would have to be implemented, it is conceivable that we may have to choose an amount of work that we believe satisfies any obligation we may have to complete work in that year, which selection we will have to defend after the fact. We expect to spend less than $5 million in connection with the 2016 Work Plan. It is conceivable we may be in the same position with respect to work in OU2-5 beyond the 2016 season. Although we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the amount we may be required to complete or to fund, those amounts could be significant. Any amounts we pay or any other party pays in the interim may be subject to reallocation when the Whiting Litigation is resolved. 
 NRDs.  The Governments  NRD assessment documents originally claimed we are jointly and severally responsible for NRDs with a value between $176 million and $333 million. The Governments claimed this range should be inflated to current dollars and then certain unreimbursed past assessment costs should be added, so the range of their claim was $287 million to $423 million in 2009.  
 However, on October 14, 2014, the Governments represented to the district court that if certain settlements providing $45.9 million toward compensation of NRDs were approved, the total NRD recovery would amount to $105 million. The Governments stated they would consider those recoveries adequate and they would withdraw their claims against us and NCR for additional compensation of NRDs. On October 19, 2015, the district court granted the Governments leave to withdraw their NRD claims against us without prejudice to re-filing them at some later time. Some of the settling parties, including all of the settling parties contributing the $45.9 million, have waived their rights to seek contribution from us of the settlement amounts. We previously paid a portion of the earlier settlements that the Governments value at $59 million and that we contend may be somewhat more. 
 Reserves for the Site.   Our reserve including ongoing monitoring obligations in OU1, our share of remediation of the downstream portions of the Site, NRDs and all pending, threatened or asserted and unasserted claims against us relating to PCB contamination is set forth below:  

- 17 -  
 GLATFELTER  
 9.30.16 Form 10-Q  

The payments set forth above represent cash paid towards completion of remediation activities in connection with the 2015 and 2016 Work Plans. Our reserve as of September 30, 2016, includes our estimate of costs to be incurred for remediation work, pending clarity from the Whiting litigation. If we are unsuccessful in the allocation litigation or in the enforcement litigation described above, we may be required to record additional charges and such charges could be significant. 
 Of our total reserve for the Fox River, $8.4 million is recorded in the accompanying September 30, 2016 condensed consolidated balance sheet under the caption  Environmental liabilities  and the remainder is recorded under the caption  Other long term liabilities.  
 As described above, the appellate court vacated and remanded for reconsideration the district court s ruling in the Whiting Litigation that NCR would bear 100% of costs for the downstream portion of the Site. We continue to believe we will not be allocated a significant share of liability in any final equitable allocation of the response costs for OU2-5 or for NRDs. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include reserves for any future defense costs, which could be significant, related to our involvement at the Site. 
 In setting our reserve for the Site, we have assessed our legal defenses, including our successful defenses to the allegations made in the Whiting Litigation and the original determination in the Whiting Litigation that NCR owes us  full contribution  for response costs and for NRDs that we may become obligated to pay except in OU1. We assume we will not bear the entire cost of remediation or damages to the exclusion of other known parties at the Site, who are also jointly and severally liable. The existence and ability of other parties to participate has also been taken into account in setting our reserve, and setting our reserve is generally based on our evaluation of recent publicly available financial information on certain of the responsible parties and any known insurance, indemnity or cost sharing agreements between responsible parties and third parties. In addition, we have considered the magnitude, nature, location and circumstances associated with the various discharges of PCBs to the river and the relationship of those discharges to identified contamination. We will continue to evaluate our exposure and the level of our reserves associated with the Site. 
   Other Information.    The Governments have published studies estimating the amount of PCBs discharged by each identified potentially responsible party to the lower Fox River and Green Bay. These reports estimate our Neenah mill s share of the mass of PCBs discharged to be as high as 27%. The district court has found the discharge mass estimates used in these studies not to be accurate. We believe the Neenah mill s absolute and relative contribution of PCB mass is significantly lower than the estimates set forth in these studies.   

The district court in the Government Action has found that the Neenah mill discharged an unknown amount of PCBs.  
 Based upon the rulings in the Whiting Litigation and the Government Action, neither of which endorsed an equitable allocation in proportion to the mass of PCBs discharged, we continue to believe an allocation in proportion to mass of PCBs discharged would not constitute an equitable allocation of the potential liability for the contamination at the Fox River. We contend other factors, such as a party s role in causing costs, the location of discharge, and the location of contamination must be considered in order for the allocation to be equitable. 
 Range of Reasonably Possible Outcomes.   Based on our analysis of all available information, including but not limited to decisions of the courts, official documents such as records of decision, as well as discussions with legal counsel and cost estimates for work to be performed at the Site, and substantially dependent on the resolution of the allocation issues discussed above, we believe it is reasonably possible that our costs associated with the Fox River matter could exceed the aggregate amounts accrued for the Fox River matter by amounts ranging from insignificant to $190 million. We believe the likelihood of an outcome in the upper end of the monetary range is less than other possible outcomes within the range and the possibility of an outcome in excess of the upper end of the monetary range is remote.   
 We expect remediation costs to be incurred primarily over the next two to three years, although we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the amount we may be required to fund for interim remediation work. To the extent we provide such interim funding, we contend that NCR or another party would be required to reimburse us once the final allocation is determined. 
 Summary.  Our current assessment is we will be able to manage this environmental matter without a long-term, material adverse impact on the Company. This matter could, however, at any particular time or for any particular year or years, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity and/or results of operations or could result in a default under our debt covenants. Moreover, there can be no assurance our reserves will be adequate to provide for future obligations related to this matter, or our share of costs and/or damages will not exceed our available resources, or those obligations will not have a long-term, material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Should a court grant the United States or the State of Wisconsin relief requiring us individually either to perform directly or to contribute significant amounts towards remedial action downstream of Little Lake Butte des Morts those developments could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity and results of operations and might result in a default under our loan covenants.

 The following tables set forth financial and other information by business unit for the period indicated: 

The sum of individual amounts set forth above may not agree to the consolidated financial statements included herein due to rounding. 

Business Units   Results of individual business units are presented based on our management accounting practices and management structure. There is no comprehensive, authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; therefore, the financial results of individual business units are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company. The management accounting process uses assumptions and allocations to measure performance of the business units. Methodologies are refined from time to time as management accounting practices are enhanced and businesses change. The costs incurred by support areas not directly aligned with the business unit are allocated primarily based on an estimated utilization of support area services or are included in  Other and Unallocated  in the Business Unit Performance table.  

Management evaluates results of operations of the business units before pension expense, certain corporate level costs, and the effects of certain gains or losses not considered to be related to the core business operations. Management believes that this is a more meaningful representation of the operating performance of its core businesses, the profitability of business units and the extent of cash flow generated from these core operations. Such amounts are presented under the caption  Other and Unallocated.  In the evaluation of business unit results, management does not use any measures of total assets. This presentation is aligned with the management and operating structure of our company. It is also on this basis that the Company s performance is evaluated internally and by the Company s Board of Directors.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein and Glatfelter s Financial Statements and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Forward-Looking Statements  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding industry prospects and future consolidated financial position or results of operations, made in this Report on Form 10-Q are forward looking. We use words such as  anticipates ,  believes ,  expects ,  future ,  intends  and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Our actual results may differ significantly from such expectations. The following discussion includes forward-looking statements regarding expectations of, among others, shipping volumes, selling prices, input costs, non-cash pension expense, environmental costs, capital expenditures and liquidity, all of which are inherently difficult to predict. Although we make such statements based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from our expectations. Accordingly, we identify the following important factors, among others, which could cause our results to differ from any results that might be projected, forecasted or estimated in any such forward-looking statements:  

i.   
 
 variations in demand for our products including the impact of unplanned market-related downtime, variations in product pricing, or product substitution;    

ii.   
 
 the impact of competition, both domestic and international, changes in industry production capacity, including the construction of new mills or new machines, the closing of mills and incremental changes due to capital expenditures or productivity increases;    

iii.   
 
 risks associated with our international operations, including local economic and political environments and fluctuations in currency exchange rates;    

iv.   
 
 geopolitical events, including the impact of conflicts such as Russia and Ukraine;    

v.   
 
 our ability to develop new, high value-added products;    

vi.   
 
 changes in the cost or availability of raw materials we use, in particular pulpwood, pulp, pulp substitutes, caustic soda, and abaca fiber;     

vii.   
 
 changes in energy-related costs and commodity raw materials with an energy component;    

viii.   
 
   the impact of unplanned production interruption;    

ix.   
 
 disruptions in production and/or increased costs due to labor disputes;    

x.   
 
 the impact of exposure to volatile market-based pricing for sales of excess electricity;    

xi.   
 
 the gain or loss of significant customers and/or on-going viability of such customers;    

xii.   
 
 cost and other effects of environmental compliance, cleanup, damages, remediation or restoration, or personal injury or property damages related thereto, such as the costs of natural resource restoration or damages related to the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls ("PCBs") in the lower Fox River on which our former Neenah mill was located;    

xiii.   
 
 adverse results in litigation in the Fox River matter;    

xiv.   
 
 the impact of war and terrorism;    

xv.   
 
 the impact of unfavorable outcomes of audits by various state, federal or international tax authorities;    

xvi.   
 
 enactment of adverse state, federal or foreign tax or other legislation or changes in government policy or regulation; and    

xvii.   
 
 our ability to finance, consummate and integrate acquisitions.    
 We manufacture a wide array of specialty papers and fiber-based engineered materials. We manage our company along three business units: 

Composite Fibers  with revenue from the sale of single-serve tea and coffee filtration papers, nonwoven wall covering materials, metallized papers, composite laminates papers, and many technically special papers including substrates for electrical applications;    

Advanced Airlaid Materials  with revenue from the sale of airlaid nonwoven fabric-like materials used in feminine hygiene and adult incontinence products, wipes, and other airlaid applications; and    

Specialty Papers  with revenue from the sale of papers for carbonless and other forms, envelopes, book publishing, and engineered products such as papers for high-speed ink jet printing, office specialty products, greeting cards, packaging, casting, release, transfer, playing card, postal, FDA-compliant food and beverage applications, and other niche specialty applications.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus the nine months ended September 30, 2015 
 Overview  Net income for the first nine months of 2016 was $37.7 million, or $0.86 per diluted share compared with $30.3 million, or $0.69 per diluted share in the first nine months of 2015. Adjusted earnings, a non-GAAP measure, was $43.0 million, or $0.98 per diluted share for the first nine months of 2016 compared with $36.0 million, or $0.82 per diluted share, for the same period a year ago. Our Advanced Airlaid Materials and Specialty Papers businesses reported significantly higher operating income in the comparison. The impact of lower selling prices was more the offset by lower input costs, improved operations and, with respect to Specialty Papers, less costly annual maintenance outages. The improved performance of these two businesses was partially offset by lower operating income in the Composite Fibers business, which was impacted by lower selling prices. The following table sets forth summarized consolidated results of operations:  

In addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP, we evaluate our performance using adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share. We disclose this information to allow investors to evaluate our performance exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period and we believe it is helpful in understanding underlying operating trends and cash flow generation. Adjusted net income consists of net income determined in accordance with GAAP adjusted to exclude the impact of the following: 
 Specialty Papers environmental compliance.  These adjustments reflect non-capitalized costs incurred by the business unit directly related to the compliance with the U.S. EPA Best Available Retrofit Technology rule (BART; otherwise known as the Regional Haze Rule) and the Boiler Maximum Achievable Control Technology rule (Boiler MACT).  
 Airlaid capacity expansion costs.  These adjustments reflect non-capitalized costs incurred directly related to the start-up of a new production facility for Advanced Airlaid Materials.  
   Fox River environmental matter   . This adjustment reflects a charge incurred to increase our reserve for estimated costs to remediate environmental contamination at the Fox River site.   

These costs are irregular in timing and as such may not be indicative of our past or future performance.  
   
 Asset impairment charges . This adjustment represents a non-cash charge required to adjust to its estimated fair value the carrying value of a trade name intangible asset. Charges of this nature are irregular in timing and as such may not be indicative of our past and future performance.  
 Timberland sales and related costs.  These adjustments exclude gains from the sales of timberlands as these items are not considered to be part of our core business, ongoing results of operations or cash flows. These adjustments are irregular in timing and amount and may significantly impact our operating performance. As such, these items may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and therefore are excluded for comparability purposes.  
 Workforce efficiency charges.  This includes costs that are directly related to actions undertaken to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies. Such costs were specifically incurred as part of our initiative to reduce global headcount as part of a more broad based cost reduction effort initiated in the fourth quarter of 2014.  
 Acquisition and integration related costs.  These adjustments include costs directly related to the consummation of the acquisition process and those related to integrating businesses previously acquired. These costs are irregular in timing and as such may not be indicative of our past and future performance.  
 Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per diluted share are considered measures not calculated in accordance with GAAP, and therefore are non-GAAP measures. The non-GAAP financial information should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Business Unit Performance 

The sum of individual amounts set forth above may not agree to the consolidated financial statements included herein due to rounding. 

Business Units  Results of individual business units are presented based on our management accounting practices and management structure. There is no comprehensive, authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; therefore, the financial results of individual business units are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company. The management accounting process uses assumptions and allocations to measure performance of the business units. Methodologies are refined from time to time as management accounting practices are enhanced and businesses change. The costs incurred by support areas not directly aligned with the business unit are allocated primarily based on an estimated utilization of support area services or are included in  Other and Unallocated  in the Business Unit Performance table.  

Management evaluates results of operations of the business units before pension expense, certain corporate level costs, and the effects of certain gains or losses not considered to be related to the core business operations. Management believes that this is a more meaningful representation of the operating performance of its core businesses, the profitability of business units and the extent of cash flow generated from these core operations. Such amounts are presented under the caption  Other and Unallocated.  In the evaluation of business unit results, management does not use any measures of total assets. This presentation is aligned with the management and operating structure of our company. It is also on this basis that the Company s performance is evaluated internally and by the Company s Board of Directors.

Sales and Costs of Products Sold  

The following table sets forth the contribution to consolidated net sales by each business unit: 

Net sales  totaled $1,213.9 million and $1,248.2 million in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $34.3 million decrease was primarily driven by $24.4 million of lower selling prices and $6.7 million of unfavorable currency translation. Shipping volumes increased 0.9%.  
 Composite Fibers  net sales decreased $18.0 million, or 4.4%, primarily due to $6.3 million of lower selling prices and $6.8 million of unfavorable currency translation. 
 Composite Fibers  operating income for the nine months of 2016 decreased $4.9 million to $40.5 million compared to the year-ago period. The primary drivers are summarized in the following chart: 

Advanced Airlaid Materials  net sales increased $0.4 million in the year-over-year comparison as the impact from higher shipping volumes was substantially offset by $7.7 million of lower selling prices, from the contractual pass  

through of lower raw material costs. Shipping volumes increased 3.8% primarily due to higher shipments of hygiene products. 
 Advanced Airlaid Materials  operating income totaled $19.7 million, an increase of $4.5 million,  compared to the same period a year ago. The primary drivers are summarized in the following chart: 
   
 Specialty Papers  net sales decreased $16.7 million, or 2.5% due to a $10.4 million impact from lower selling prices. Shipping volumes  increased 0.7%. The business unit again outperformed the broader uncoated freesheet market which declined 0.8%. 
 Operating income totaled $27.9 million, an increase of $11.0 million compared to the first nine months of 2015. The primary drivers are summarized in the following chart: 

The improvement in  Operations   Other  in the chart above includes $7.1 million from the lower cost of the annual maintenance outages.

We sell excess power generated by the Spring Grove, PA facility. The following table summarizes this activity for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015: 

Renewable energy credits ( RECs ) represent sales of certified credits earned related to burning renewable sources of energy such as black liquor and wood waste. We sell RECs into an illiquid market. The extent and value of future revenues from REC sales is dependent on many factors outside of management s control. Therefore, we may not be able to generate consistent additional sales of RECs in future periods. 
 Other and Unallocated  The amount of net operating expenses not allocated to a business unit and reported as  Other and Unallocated  in our table of Business Unit Performance, totaled $31.2 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared with $29.9 million in the first nine months of 2015. Excluding $2.9 million of gains in 2015 from sales of timberlands in the comparison, unallocated net operating expenses decreased $1.6 million primarily due to lower pension expense.  
 Pension Expense  The following table summarizes the amounts of pension expense recognized for the periods indicated:  

The amount of pension expense recognized each year is dependent on various actuarial assumptions and certain other factors, including discount rates and the fair value of our pension assets. Pension expense for the full year of 2016 is expected to be approximately $5.5 million compared with $9.1 million in 2015. The decrease reflects the impact of higher discount rates partially offset by a lower assumed long term rate of return on plan assets. 
   Income taxes    For the first nine months of 2016, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $6.5 million on pretax income of $44.2 million. The comparable amounts in the same period of 2015 were $4.1 million and $34.4 million, respectively. Tax   

expense in the first nine months of 2016 includes a benefit of $2.4 million primarily due to investment tax credits, release of reserves related to the completion of tax audits and changes in statutory tax rates. The effective tax rate in 2015 includes the benefit of a $2.6 million release of uncertain tax positions in connection with the completion of certain tax audits.  
 Foreign Currency  We own and operate facilities in Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and the Philippines. The functional currency of our Canadian operations is the U.S. dollar. However, in Germany and France it is the Euro, in the UK, it is the British Pound Sterling, and in the Philippines the functional currency is the Peso. On an annual basis, our euro denominated revenue exceeds euro expenses by approximately  120 million. For the first nine months of 2016,  the average currency exchange rate was essentially unchanged in the year over year comparison. With respect to the British Pound Sterling, Canadian dollar, and Philippine Peso, we have differing amounts of inflows and outflows of these currencies, although to a lesser degree than the euro. As a result, we are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and such changes could be significant. The translation of the results from international operations into U.S. dollars is subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  
   
 The table below summarizes the translation impact on reported results that changes in currency exchange rates had on our non-U.S. based operations from the conversion of these operation s results for the first nine months of 2016. 

The above table only presents the financial reporting impact of foreign currency translations assuming currency exchange rates in 2016 were the same as 2015. It does not present the impact of certain competitive advantages or disadvantages of operating or competing in multi-currency markets.

The following table sets forth the contribution to consolidated net sales by each business unit: 

Net sales  totaled $405.3 million and $420.0 million in the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Lower selling prices unfavorably impacted the year-over-year comparison by $6.3 million and shipping volumes declined 2.1%.   
 Composite Fibers  net sales declined $2.3 million, or 1.7%, primarily due to $1.6 million from lower selling prices. Shipping volumes increased 0.5% in the comparison. 
 Composite Fibers  third quarter of 2016 operating income decrease slightly to $14.0 million. The primary drivers are summarized in the following chart: 
   
 Advanced Airlaid Materials  net sales decreased $1.3 million in the quarter-over-quarter comparison primarily due to $2.2 million of lower selling prices. Shipping volumes increased 1.8% primarily due to higher shipments of wipes products. 

Advanced Airlaid Materials  operating income totaled $6.4 million compared with $6.8 million in the third quarter of 2015. The primary drivers are summarized in the following chart: 
   
 Specialty Papers  net sales decreased $11.0 million, or 5.0%, due to a 3.1 % decline in shipping volumes and a $2.5 million impact from lower selling prices. 
 Specialty Papers  operating income totaled $18.7 million in the third quarter of 2016, slightly higher compared with the same period a year ago. The primary drivers are summarized in the following chart:

compared with $18.2 million in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the $10.0 million reserve for environmental matters recorded in the third quarter of 2015, partially offset by higher incentive compensation and professional service fees in 2016.  
 Pension Expense  The following table summarizes the amounts of pension expense recognized for the periods indicated:  

Income taxes  For the third quarter of 2016, we recorded $1.4 million of tax expense on pretax income of $21.0 million. The comparable amounts in the third quarter of 2015 were taxes of $2.3 million on a pretax income of $15.8 million. The third quarter 2016 tax rate benefited by $2.4 million primarily due to investment tax credits, release of reserves related to the completion of tax audits and changes in statutory tax rates.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
     Our business is capital intensive and requires significant expenditures for new or enhanced equipment, to support our research and development efforts, for environmental compliance matters including, but not limited to, the Clean Air Act, and to support our business strategy. In addition, we have mandatory debt service requirements of both principal and  

interest. The following table summarizes cash flow information for each of the periods presented: 

At September 30, 2016, we had $50.8 million in cash and cash equivalents held by both domestic and foreign subsidiaries. Unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested; however, as of September 30, 2016, the majority of our cash and cash equivalents is either held by domestic entities or is available for use domestically. In addition to our cash and cash equivalents, $227.8 million is available under our revolving credit agreement, which matures in March 2020. 
 Cash provided by operating activities totaled $59.4 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared with $70.5 million in the same period a year ago. The decrease in cash from operations primarily reflects an increase in cash used for working capital partially offset by improved operating income. 
 Net cash used by investing activities increased by $44.4 million in the year-over-year comparison primarily due to capital expenditures for Specialty Papers  environmental compliance and Advanced Airlaid Materials  capacity expansion projects which totaled $73.6 million in 2016 compared to $19.0 million in 2015. Capital expenditures are expected to total between $155 million and $170 million for 2016, including approximately $55 million to $60 million for the Specialty Papers  environmental compliance projects and $40 million to $45 million for the Airlaid capacity expansion.  
 Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $3.0 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared with a use of $21.9 million in the same period of 2015. The increase in cash provided by financing activities primarily reflects additional term loan borrowings and receipt of $5.3 million of government grants primarily related to our Airlaid capacity expansion and Specialty Papers  compliance projects.

The following table sets forth our outstanding long-term indebtedness: 

Our revolving credit facility contains a number of customary compliance covenants, the most restrictive of which is a maximum leverage ratio of 3.5x. As of September 30, 2016, the leverage ratio, as calculated in accordance with the definition in our credit agreement, was 2.1x, within the limits set forth in our credit agreement. Based on our expectations of future results of operations and capital needs, we do not believe the debt covenants will impact our operations or limit our ability to undertake financings that may be necessary to meet our capital needs. 
 The 5.375% Notes contain cross default provisions that could result in all such notes becoming due and payable in the event of a failure to repay debt outstanding under the credit agreement at maturity, or a default under the credit agreement that accelerates the debt outstanding thereunder. As of September 30, 2016, we met all of the requirements of our debt covenants. The significant terms of the debt instruments are more fully discussed in Item 1 - Financial Statements   Note 9. 
 Financing activities includes cash used for common stock dividends which increased in the comparison reflecting a 4% increase in our quarterly cash dividend. In the first nine months of 2016, we used $16.1 million of cash for dividends on our common stock compared with $15.2 million in the same period of 2015. Our Board of Directors determines what, if any, dividends will be paid to our shareholders. Dividend payment decisions are based upon then-existing factors and conditions and, therefore, historical trends of dividend payments are not necessarily indicative of future payments. 
     We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations intended to protect the environment as well as human health and safety. At various times, we have incurred significant costs to comply with these regulations and we could incur additional costs as new regulations are developed or regulatory priorities change. We will incur material capital costs to comply with new air quality regulations including the  

U.S. EPA Best Available Retrofit Technology rule (BART; otherwise known as the Regional Haze Rule) and the Boiler Maximum Achievable Control Technology rule (Boiler MACT). These rules will require process modifications and/or installation of air pollution controls on boilers at two of our facilities. We are converting or replacing five coal-fired boilers to natural gas and upgrading site infrastructure to accommodate the new boilers, including connecting to gas pipelines. Net of government grants, the total cost of these projects is estimated at $95 million to $100 million, of which approximately $82.9 million has been incurred through the end of the third quarter of 2016. The balance of the related spending will be substantially completed in 2016. 
 As more fully discussed in Item 1 - Financial Statements   Note 12   Commitments, Contingencies and Legal Proceedings ( Note 12 ), we are involved in the Lower Fox River in Wisconsin (the  Fox River ), an EPA Superfund site for which we remain potentially liable for contributions to the clean-up activity. During 2015, we used $9.7 million and expect to spend less than $5.0 million in 2016 for remediation activities. It is conceivable we may need to fund amounts in excess of this to fund a portion of the on-going costs beyond 2016. Although we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the amount we may be required to fund for interim remediation work, such amounts could be significant. The ultimate allocation of such costs is the subject of extensive ongoing litigation amongst three potentially responsible parties. See Note 12 for a summary of significant environmental matters. 
 During 2016, we expect our use of cash for capital expenditures, strategic investments and environmental compliance projects will exceed cash generated from operations. We expect to meet all of our near and long-term cash needs from a combination of operating cash flow, cash and cash equivalents, our existing credit facility and other long-term debt. However, as discussed in Note 12, an unfavorable outcome of the Fox River matters could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, liquidity and/or results of operations.

Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had not entered into any off-balance-sheet arrangements. Financial derivative instruments, to which we are a party, and guarantees of indebtedness, which solely consist of obligations of subsidiaries, are reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheets included herein in Item 1   Financial Statements.  
   
 Outlook  Composite Fibers  shipping volumes in the fourth quarter of 2016 are expected be approximately 5% lower than the third quarter driven by lower sales of metalized products. Selling prices and raw material and energy prices are expected to be in-line with the third quarter. We anticipate the impact of machine downtime to reduce inventory levels will be largely offset by cost reduction initiatives.  
   
 Advanced Airlaid Materials  shipping volumes are expected to decline slightly compared with the third quarter. Customer selling prices and raw material and energy prices are expected to be in-line with the third quarter. 
   
 For Specialty Papers, shipping volumes in the fourth quarter are expected to be in line with the third quarter. Lower selling prices and mix changes are expected to reduce operating profit by approximately $5 million. The impact of machine downtime to reduce inventory levels is expected to be offset by lower maintenance costs. Raw material and energy prices are expected to increase moderately.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI  VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  S  

The table above presents the average principal outstanding and related interest rates for the next five years for debt outstanding as of September 30, 2016. Fair values included herein have been determined based upon rates currently available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. 
 Our market risk exposure primarily results from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. At September 30, 2016, we had $379.0 million of long-term debt, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, of which 15.8% was at variable interest rates. Variable-rate debt outstanding represents borrowings under our revolving credit agreement that accrues interest based on LIBOR plus a margin. At September 30, 2016, the interest rate paid was approximately 1.25%. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in the interest rate on variable rate debt would increase or decrease annual interest expense by $0.6 million. 
 As part of our overall risk management practices, we enter into financial derivatives primarily designed to either i) hedge foreign currency risks associated with forecasted transactions    cash flow hedges  or ii) mitigate the impact that changes in currency exchange rates have on intercompany financing transactions and foreign currency denominated receivables and payables    foreign currency hedges.  For a more complete discussion of this activity, refer to Item 1   Financial Statements   Note 11. 

We are subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our operations are conducted in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. On an annual basis, our euro denominated revenue exceeds euro expenses by approximately  120 million. With respect to the British Pound Sterling, Canadian dollar, and Philippine Peso, we have differing amounts of inflows and outflows of these currencies, although to a lesser degree than the euro. As a result, particularly with respect to the euro, we are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and such changes could be significant. 
     ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  Our chief executive officer and our principal financial officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2016, have concluded that, as of the evaluation date, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.  
 Changes in Internal Controls  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
