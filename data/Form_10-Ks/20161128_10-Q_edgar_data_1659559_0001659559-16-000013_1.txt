RIZZEN INC.  
  NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
  FOR THE NINE MONTHS PERIOD ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2016  
   
 NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
  Organization and Description of Business 
 RIZZEN INC.( the Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada, U.S. on October 21, 2015.  The Company s business is distribution of children s toys from China. 
 Since inception through October 31, 2016 the Company has generated $5,100 revenue and has accumulated losses of $13,685. 
 Basis of Presentation 
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial positions, results of operations, and cash flows on October 31, 2016, and for all periods presented herein, have been made. 
   
 Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted.  It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s January 31, 2016 audited financial statements.  The results of operations for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year .  
   
 The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars. The Company has adopted a January 31 fiscal year end.  
 NOTE 2  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
  Cash and Cash Equivalents  
 The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of nine months or less to be cash equivalents to the extent the funds are not being held for investment purposes. 
 The Company's bank accounts are deposited in insured institutions. The funds are insured up to $250,000. At October 31, 2016 the Company's bank deposits did not exceed the insured amounts. 
  Basic Income (Loss) Per Share  
 The Company computes loss per share in accordance with  ASC-260 ,  Earnings per Share  which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.  Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. 
  Dividends  
 The Company has not adopted any policy regarding payment of dividends. No dividends have been paid during any of the periods shown. 

6 |  Page  

Income Taxes  
 The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes.  Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income tax basis (temporary differences).   
The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  
  Advertising Costs  
 The Company s policy regarding advertising is to expense advertising when incurred. The Company incurred advertising expense of $0 during as at October 31, 2016. 
  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  
 The Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances are present, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell. 
  Use of Estimates  
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Stock-Based Compensation  
 As of October 31, 2016 the Company has not issued any stock-based payments to its employees. Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and 123(R) (ASC 718).  To date, the Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options. 
  Revenue Recognition  
 The Company will recognize revenue when products are fully delivered or services have been provided and collection is reasonably assured. 
   Property and Equipment and Depreciation Policy   
 Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on the straight line method over the estimated life of the asset, which is 3 years. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
 The Company has reviewed all the recent accounting pronouncements issued to date of the issuance of these financial statements, and does not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the company. 
 NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN 
 The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future.   
 The Company has incurred a loss since Inception (October 21, 2015) resulting in an accumulated deficit of $13,685 as of October 31, 2016 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business.  Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.   
 The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand and loans from directors and/or private placement of common stock.   
 NOTE 4   CAPTIAL STOCK 
 The Company has 75,000,000 shares of common stock authorized with a par value of $0.001 per share.  
 On January 13, 2016 the Company issued 5,000,000 shares of its common stock at $0.001 per share for total proceeds of $5,000. On January 26, 2016 the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of its common stock at $0.001 per share for total proceeds of $1,000.  In June and July 2016, the Company issued 1,285,000 shares of its common stock at $0.02 per share for total proceeds of $25,700. 
 As of October 31, 2016 the Company had 7,285,000 shares issued and outstanding. 
 NOTE 5   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
  In support of the Company s efforts and cash requirements, it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the Company can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment for continued support by officers, directors, or shareholders. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized by a promissory note.   
 Since October 21, 2015 (inception) through October 31, 2016, the Company s sole officer and director loaned the Company $1,042 to pay for incorporation costs and operating expenses.  As of October 31, 2016, the amount outstanding was $1,042. The loan is non-interest bearing, due upon demand and unsecured. 
 NOTE 6   INCOME TAX 
 As of October 31, 2016 the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of $13,685 that may be available to reduce future years  taxable income through 2036. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards. 
 NOTE 7   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
   
 In accordance with ASC 855, the Company has analyzed its operations subsequent to October 31, 2016 through the date these financial statements were issued, and has determined that it does not have any material subsequent events to disclose in these financial statements.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION 
   
 GENERAL 
   
 The company intends to provide vending and shipping services of electronic toys of various kinds manufactured in the Republic of China.  
   
 We are wholesale trade company. We plan to implement the distribution of electronic toys for children on the territory of Europe and North America. We act as an intermediary between our potential customers (retail stores or wholesalers) and manufacturers producing toys in China.

We consider the Internet to be our main marketplace, all our advertising is likely to come online in a form of clickable ads (banners) placed on the websites related to kids merchandise. We intend to increase awareness of our company by placing our video commercials within the video-streaming services (YouTube, Vimeo, Hulu, Netflix and others) that provide video for children, thereby attracting attention of parents, whom we refer to as our potential clients. 
   
 Once the company starts running, any to manufacturers is planned to be given an option to be displayed on the website, after lodging a proper corresponding request. We plan to charge manufacturers for occupying positions on our website, offering professionally produced ads and other displaying materials.  
   
 The services regarding toys, are aimed at different kids categories, from toddlers to teenagers. We plan to offer the goods that might be interesting to kids of various ages:

 5) Spare parts, wear parts (such as batteries) and accessories. 

RESULTS OF OPERATION 
   
 As of October 31, 2016, we have accumulated a deficit of $13,685.  We anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial losses in the next 12 months. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern.  We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.

 Stockholders  equity increased from $5,018 as of January 31, 2015 to $18,015 as of October 31, 2016.

9 |  Page  

Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next three months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of inventory; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. 
   
 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
   
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 
   
 GOING CONCERN 
   
 The independent auditors' report accompanying our January 31, 2015 financial statements contained an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared  assuming that we will continue as a going concern,  which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. 
   
   ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
   
 As a  smaller  reporting  company  as defined by Item 10 of Regulation  S-K, the Company is not required to provide information required by this Item. 
     
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
   
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
   
 Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
