INTRODUCTORY
NOTE  

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995 about Energy   Technology, Corp. (the  Company ) and our subsidiaries, Technical Industries,
Inc. (TII), Energy Pipe, LLC (EP), (a variable interest entity), and Energy Technology Manufacturing   Threading, LLC (ETMT),
(a variable interest entity), that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include information concerning
future financial performance, business strategy, projected plans and objectives. Statements preceded by, followed by or that otherwise
include the words  anticipates,   believes,   estimates,   expects,   intends, 
 plans,   may increase,   may fluctuate  and similar expressions of future or conditional
verbs such as  will,   should,   would,  and  could  are generally forward-looking
in nature and not historical facts. Actual results may differ materially from those projected, implied, anticipated or expected
in the forward-looking statements. Readers of this quarterly report should not rely solely on the forward-looking statements and
should consider all uncertainties and risks throughout this report. The statements are representative only as of the date they
are made. The Company, Technical Industries, Inc. (TII), Energy Pipe, LLC (EP), and Energy Technology Manufacturing   Threading,
LLC (ETMT), (sometimes referred to herein on a consolidated basis as the Company, we, us, or similar phrasing) undertakes no obligation
to update any forward-looking statement.  

These
forward-looking statements, implicitly and explicitly, include the assumptions underlying the statements and other information
with respect to the Company's beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, expectations, anticipations, estimates, financial condition,
results of operations, future performance and business, including management's expectations and estimates with respect to revenues,
expenses, return on equity, return on assets, efficiency ratio, asset quality and other financial data and capital and performance
ratios.  

Although
the Company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, these statements involve
risks and uncertainties that are subject to change based on various important factors, some of which are beyond the control of
the Company. The following factors, among others, could cause the Company's results or financial performance to differ materially
from its goals, plans, objectives, intentions, expectations and other forward-looking statements:  

general
                                         economic and industry conditions;    

our
                                         capital requirements and dependence on the sale of our equity securities;    

the
                                         liquidity of the Company s common stock will be affected by the lack of a trading
                                         market;    

industry
                                         competition;    

shortages
                                         in availability of qualified personnel;    

legal
                                         and financial implications of unexpected catastrophic events;    

regulatory
                                         or legislative changes effecting the industries we serve; and    

reliance
                                         on, and the ability to attract, key personnel.    

For
a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the
forward-looking statements, see  Risk Factors  in the Company s S-1 Report filed with the SEC, which is available
on the SEC s website at  www.sec.gov . All forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary
statement, and the Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect events or
circumstances after the date hereof. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which factors,
if any, will arise. In addition, the Company cannot assess the impact of each factor on the Company s business or the extent
to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking
statements.

   NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.   

Note 1.   
       Organization    

This
Financial statement is unaudited.  

  Energy
and Technology, Corp. (the Company) was formed November 29, 2006 under the laws of the State of Delaware in order to acquire and
to take over the assets and business of Technical Industries, Inc. (TII). On that date, the Company issued 125,000,000 shares
of common stock to American Interest, LLC, in exchange for founder services rendered. The fair value of these services was considered
immaterial, and no amounts were recognized in the financial statements. At the time the shares were issued to American Interest,
LLC, the Company had no assets, operations, or cash flows. As such, the stock had no value at the time the Company was established.
The par value was arbitrarily established in order to comply with the State of Delaware laws. In order to reflect the par value
of the shares issued, the Company recognized a discount on capital stock as a contra-equity account within the equity section
of the consolidated balance sheets.  

On
January 3, 2007, the Company entered into a Stock Exchange Agreement and Share Exchange (the Agreement) whereby the sole shareholder
of TII exchanged all of the outstanding shares of TII to the Company in exchange for 50,000,000 shares of Company stock. Accordingly,
TII became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at the carrying
value to TII since TII and the Company were under common control prior to the acquisition.  

Energy
Pipe LLC, (EP) was established to trade pipe and equipment.  

Thereafter
in early 2008 Energy Technology Manufacturing LLC (ETMT) was established in order to manufacture and process pipe and equipment.  

In
early of 2014 the assets of Total Pipe Services, Inc. were acquired and added to ETMT in order to handle large size OD pipe and
establish a manufacturing division in Louisiana.  

In
July of 2016 rental and Cavern Work Over division was added to handle a contract with U.S. Strategic Reserve and expand our market
and products and service line.  

TII
specializes in the non-destructive testing of vessels, oilfield equipment and mainly pipe, including ultrasonic testing, utilizing
the latest technologies. These technologies enable TII to (i) provide detailed information to customers regarding each pipe tested,
and (ii) reach energy reserves present technology cannot reach without extra cost to the oil and gas companies. Because of the
intense scrutiny applied to each section of pipe, TII is able to generate data which allows the pipe to be used in the most extreme
conditions, and has been proven especially useful in deep water drilling operations in the Gulf of Mexico.  

On
August 29, 2009, the Company effected a name change from Technical Industries   Energy Corp. to Energy   Technology, Corp.
to better reflect the nature of the Company s business.  

Note 2.   
       Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    

Basis
of Presentation and Consolidation   

  The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Technical Industries, Inc.,
the accounts of Energy Pipe, LLC (a variable interest entity), and the accounts of Energy Technology Manufacturing   Threading,
LLC (a variable interest entity). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  

The
consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation
of financial information for the interim periods presented. These adjustments are of a normal recurring nature and include appropriate
estimated provisions.  

Basis
of Accounting   

  Assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses are recognized on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.  

ENERGY
  TECHNOLOGY, CORP.   

   NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.   

Note 2.   
       Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)    

Use
of Estimates   

  The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. Accordingly, actual
results could differ from those estimates due to information that becomes available subsequent to the issuance of the financial
statements or for other reasons.  

Revenue
Recognition   

  Revenue
for inspection services and manufacturing and threading services is recognized upon completion of the services rendered. Revenue
for the sales of pipe is recognized when pipe is delivered and the customer takes ownership and assumes the risks of loss, collection
of the relevant receivable is probable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, and the sales price is fixed or determinable.  

Trade
Receivables   

  Trade
accounts receivable are carried at their estimated collectible amounts. Trade credit is generally extended on a short-term basis;
thus receivables do not bear interest, although a finance charge may be applied to amounts past due. Trade accounts receivable
are periodically evaluated for collectability based on past credit.  

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts   

  The
company calculates the allowance based on the history with customers and their current financial condition. Provisions of uncollectible
amounts are determined based on management s estimate of collectability. Allowance for doubtful accounts was $3,078 and
$3,078 at September 30, 2016 and at December 31, 2015, respectively.  

Inventory   

  Inventory
is stated at the lower of cost determined by the specific identification method or market. At September 30, 2016 and at December
31, 2015, inventory consisted of pipe available for sale.  

Property
and Equipment   

  Property
and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for property and equipment and items that substantially increase the useful lives
of existing assets are capitalized at cost and depreciated. Routine expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
The cost and related accumulated depreciation of property and equipment disposed of are eliminated from the accounts, and any
resulting gain or loss is recognized. Depreciation is provided utilizing the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
of the assets capitalized.  

Valuation
of Long-Lived Assets   

  In
the event facts and circumstances indicate that carrying amounts of long-lived assets may be impaired, the Company evaluates the
recoverability of its long-lived assets using the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset compared
to the asset s carrying amount to determine if a write-down is required, pursuant to the provisions of Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) ASC 360-10-35. Any impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair
value of the impaired asset.

  TECHNOLOGY, CORP.   

   NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.   

Note 2.   
       Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)    

Credit
Risk   

  Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments
and trade receivables. Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the Company s large
number of customers. At September 30, 2016, the balance due from two customers represented 97% of receivables, and sales to two
customers represented 69% of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

The
Company maintains cash balances at several financial institutions, and periodically maintains cash in bank accounts in excess
of insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses and does not believe that significant credit risk exists as a result
of this practice.  

Advertising   

  The
Company charges the costs of advertising to expense as incurred. Advertising expense was $5,653 and $6,723, for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Cash
Flows   

  For
purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity
of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  

Income
Taxes   

  The
Company recognizes income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740,  Income Taxes  (formerly Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes). ASC 740 uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of  temporary differences 
by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to the difference between financial statement carrying amounts
and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. Deferred taxes are also recognized for operating losses and tax credits
that are available to offset future income taxes.  

When
tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities,
while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately
sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available
evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution
of appeals or litigation processes, if any.  

Tax
positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition
threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with
the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured
as described above would be reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the consolidated balance sheet along with
any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. Interest and penalties
associated with unrecognized tax benefits would be classified as additional income taxes in the statement of operations.  

Emerging
Growth Company Critical Accounting Policy Disclosure   

  The
Company qualifies as an  emerging growth company  under the 2012 JOBS Act. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that
an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities
Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. As an emerging growth company, the Company can delay the adoption
of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The Company may elect to take
advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period in the future.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

  Management
does not expect any impact from the adoption of new accounting pronouncements.  

Comprehensive
Income   

  The
Company had no components of comprehensive income. Therefore, net income (loss) equals comprehensive income (loss) for the periods
presented.

  TECHNOLOGY, CORP.   

   NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.   

Note 3.   
       Patent    

On
September 4, 2007, the Company s chief executive officer was awarded a patent from the United States Patent and Trademark
Office pertaining to his development of specialized testing procedures for tubing casing, line pipe, and expandable liners utilized
by oil-exploration companies which was subsequently transferred to the Company.  

In
a prior year, the Company s costs associated with its development of these testing procedures and application for patent
have been capitalized and recognized as an asset in the Company s balance sheet, and was being amortized over 20 years.
Audit findings for 2014 resulted in the write off of the Patents and the related Accumulated Amortization due to the fact that
they were internally created. The Company has capitalized all legal expenses incurred in the defense of the Patent.  

Note 4.   
       Property and Equipment    

Property
and equipment consists of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively:  

Depreciation
expense amounted to $288,082 and $451,641 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

   NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.   

Note 6.   
       Notes Payable    

Notes
payable at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consist of the following:  

Following
are maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 2015:  

Note 7.   
       Equity    

The
Company is authorized to issue 250,000,000 shares of common stock at a par value of $.001 per share. The number of shares issued
and outstanding are 165,560,766 and 165,548,766 as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company issued 12,000
of stock in lieu of services performed on June 30, 2016. The Company is authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock.
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no shares issued and outstanding. In 2014, the company purchased 3,617,075
shares of common stock now in Treasury.  

Note 8.   
       Earnings per Share    

Earnings
(loss) per share are calculated in accordance with ASC 260  Earnings per Share . The weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during each period is used to compute basic earnings (loss) per share. Diluted earnings per share are computed
using the weighted average number of shares and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding. Dilutive potential common shares
are additional common shares assumed to be exercised. Potentially dilutive common shares consist of stock options and are excluded
from the diluted earnings per share computation in periods where the Company has incurred a net loss, as their effect would be
considered anti-dilutive.  

There
were no potentially dilutive common stock equivalents as of September 30, 2016, therefore basic earnings per share equals diluted
earnings per share for the three months ended September 30, 2016. As the Company incurred a net loss during the three months ended
September 30, 2016, the basic and diluted loss per common share is the same amount, as any common stock equivalents would be considered
anti-dilutive.  

The
weighted average common shares outstanding were 165,560,766 and 165,560,766 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the
year ended December 31, 2015.

at September 30, 2016 was $288,283.  

Note 12.   
       Estimated Fair Value of Financial Instruments    

The
following disclosure is made in accordance with the requirements of FASB ASC 825,  Financial Instruments . Financial instruments
are defined as cash and contractual rights and obligations that require settlement, directly or indirectly, in cash. In cases
where quoted market prices are not available, fair values have been estimated using the present value of future cash flows or
other valuation techniques.  

The
result of these techniques are highly sensitive to the assumptions used, such as those concerning appropriate discount rates and
estimates of future cash flows, which require considerable judgment. Accordingly, estimates presented herein are not necessarily
indicative of the amounts the Company could realize in a current settlement of the underlying financial instruments. ASC 825 excludes
certain financial instruments and all non-financial instruments from its disclosure requirements. These disclosures should not
be interpreted as representing an aggregate measure of the underlying value of the Company.  

While
these estimates of fair value are based on management's judgment of appropriate factors, there is no assurance that if the Company
had disposed of such items at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015, the estimated fair values would have been achieved. Market
values may differ depending on various circumstances not taken into consideration in this methodology. The estimated fair values
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, should not necessarily be considered to apply at subsequent dates.  

The
following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating fair values for financial instruments:  

Cash
and cash equivalents:  The carrying amount reported in the balance sheet approximates fair value.  

Notes
Payable:  The fair value of notes payable approximates the carrying amount reported in the balance sheet.  

Due
to Affiliates:  The carrying amount of due to affiliates approximates fair values.  

Note 13.   
       Subsequent Events    

In
accordance with the subsequent events topic of the FASB ASC, Topic No. 855,  Subsequent Events , the Company evaluates events
and transactions that occur after the balance sheet date for potential recognition in the financial statements. The effects of
all subsequent events that provide additional evidence of conditions that existed at the balance sheet date are recognized in
the financial statements as of September 30, 2016. In preparing these financial statements, the Company evaluated the events and
transactions through the date these financial statements were issued.  

ITEM 2.   
       MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    

General   

    Headquartered
in Lafayette, Louisiana, with production facilities in Houston, Texas and Abbeville, Louisiana, Energy   Technology, Corp.
provides non-destructive testing (NDT) services, OCTG and oilfield pipe sales, service and storage, and rig and equipment sales.
Originally founded on May 11, 1971 as an inspection company, Energy   Technology, Corp. currently serves customers throughout
the oil patch of Louisiana and Texas as well as in Canada, Mexico, and in the Gulf of Mexico. The Company s customer base
of over 130 accounts consists of major oil companies, steel mills, material suppliers, drilling companies, tool rental companies,
and natural gas storage operators. Due to the nature of its technology, the Company maintains competitive advantages in offshore
deep water and other onshore critical projects.  

Technical
Industries, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Energy   Technology, Corp., manufactures its own proprietary NDT equipment.
The Company s patented ultrasonic systems have some of the largest OD and pipe length capabilities in the industry and the
deepest penetration capability offered for wall thickness measurement. The Company holds patents on certain exclusive inspection
technology that allows oil and gas companies to use their current drill strings and other equipment to reach depths that were
previously unreachable. This technology can make wells safer, increase the success rate for critical wells, and greatly reduce
the chances of a failure. As the industry moves to ever deeper reserves and makes advances in horizontal drilling, oil and gas
wells are becoming more and more expensive and difficult to drill, making this technology more of a necessity.  

In
the oilfield pipe sales and storage segment, Energy   Technology, Corp utilizes a state-of-the-art web based inventory management
system that allows each client to view and track projects during processing, to locate inventory throughout the plant, and access
reports, bill of ladings, tally sheets, logs and other required information.  

Energy
Technology Manufacturing   Threading, LLC s new facility has been completed and is fully operational. This facility
is capable of threading, bucking, and repair of drill pipe, casing, and tubing up to 11 7/8  diameter. The plant is equipped
with a Computer Controlled lathe accurate to within the most critical of tolerances, and has the capability to manufacture, thread,
repair, and manufacture pup joints and marker joints to any length the customer requires, as well as to machine any threads for
which specs can be furnished. Technicians have between 10 and 34 years of experience in the manufacturing and threading industry.
This new facility brings Energy   Technology, Corp. one step closer to its goal of supplying all tubular services under one
roof.  

Key
Ongoing Operational Processes:  

Update
ISO Certification   

  Energy
  Technology, Corp. recognizes that quality is every bit as important as price and prompt service. This is even truer of the
Company s typical client, who often contracts for services that other companies are not able to provide. In response to
our clients  requirements, the Company has obtained the latest ISO: 9001 certification by Moody s, recognized in the
industry as representing the highest quality control available. As the Company s business lines are very synergistic, management
feels that it can leverage this dominant position to increase share in the markets in which it competes, and likely more in the
critical service arena.  

Foreign
Trade Zone Status   

  Energy
  Technology, Corp. has selected the well-known auditing and financial consulting firm KPMG to assist the Company in meeting
the requirements to establish a Foreign Trade Zone at its Houston, Texas facility. KPMG has started the initial feasibility analysis
with the formal application to follow. The establishment of a Foreign Trade Zone is expected to produce a substantial increase
in the Company s ability to sell to overseas markets, and make the Company a far more attractive distribution partner for
foreign manufacturers. Management feels that market share could be taken through a successful designation as an FTZ subzone.  

Increased
Sales and Marketing Effort   

  Energy
  Technology, Corp. hired three qualified personnel in order to help the marketing and sales effort. New business was generated
from referrals, technical sessions given to oil and gas and industry related companies, the Company website, and through the use
of a marketing company on a limited basis. Recently, several new deep water well permits were issued in the Gulf of Mexico. As
a result, ENGT has experienced significant new interest from major oil and gas companies - including site visits and evaluations
for its VisonArray  deep water and critical well technologies, and ENGT Manufacturing facilities. Currently, there are
several employees whose duties are focused on sales, and one marketing and promotional activity director. Management believes
revenue can be greatly increased by expanding the Company's sales force.  

Diversification   

  Energy
  Technology, Corp. has diligently worked to diversify its business model by adding sales, service, and storage of OCTG and
all types of oilfield pipe, as well as equipment leasing and sales. The Company s new threading and repair facility, located
on our Houston campus, became operational in July 2010 and on September 30, 2011 received numerous ISO and API certifications.
Additional growth will come domestically, but management feels that overseas expansion is critical to the ultimate success of
the business plan.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

  The
Company has identified the following accounting policies to be the critical accounting policies of the Company:  

Revenue
Recognition.  Revenue for inspection services and manufacturing and threading services are recognized upon completion of the
services rendered. Revenue for the sales of pipe is recognized when pipe is delivered and the customer takes ownership and assumes
the risks of loss, collection of the relevant receivable is probable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, and the sales
price is fixed or determinable.  

Inventory.
 Inventory is stated at the lower of cost determined by the specific identification method or market. At September 30, 2016
inventory consisted of pipe available for sale.  

Property
and Equipment.  Property and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for property and equipment and items that substantially
increase the useful lives of existing assets are capitalized at cost and depreciated. Routine expenditures for repairs and maintenance
are expensed as incurred. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of property and equipment disposed of are eliminated from
the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is recognized. Depreciation is provided utilizing the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets capitalized.  

Valuation
of Long-Lived Assets.  In the event facts and circumstances indicate that carrying amounts of long-lived assets may be impaired,
the Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets using the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated
with the asset compared to the asset s carrying amount to determine if a write-down is required, pursuant to the provisions
of SFAS Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC 360-10-35. Any impairment loss is measured as the difference between the
carrying amount and the fair value of the impaired asset.  

Discussion
of Changes in Financial Condition from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016   

At
September 30, 2016, total assets amounted to $4,317,459 compared to $4,632,405 at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $314,946, or
6.8%. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in other assets of $171,435, a decrease in property and equipment held for operations
of $237,722, partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $45,418, net accounts receivable of $48,342 and prepaid
expenses of $7,845 and capitalized patent cost of $26,061.  

Our
liabilities at September 30, 2016, totaled $7,641,410 compared to $6,943,764 at December 31, 2015, an increase of $697,646, or
10.05%. The increase is primarily due to an increase in accrued rent of $112,500, and increase in current notes payable of $280,448,
and an increase in due to affiliates of $310,417.  

Total
stockholder s equity decreased from ($2,311,359) at December 31, 2015, to ($3,323,950) at September 30, 2016. This decrease
was due to our net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

  Cash
and Cash Equivalents totaled $84,399 at September 30, 2016, an increase of $45,418 from the balance of $38,981 at December 31,
2015. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to amounts used to reduce debt, partially offset by the cash
generated from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Inventory   

  Inventory
consists primarily of pipe held for sale to our customers. We began purchasing pipe for sale to customers in December, 2007. This
was an opportunity for us to expand our services to our customers. It is anticipated that the Company will continue its efforts
to expand its sales of pipe.  

Property
and Equipment   

  The
decrease in property and equipment is primarily due to depreciation for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $288,082.  

Accounts
Payable   

  Accounts
payable at September 30, 2016 totaled $628,684 compared to $597,466 at December 31, 2015, an increase of $31,218. The increase
is primarily due to the accounts owed in the course of operations.  

Discussion
of Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   

Revenues   

  Our
revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was $429,828, compared to $645,045, for the three months ended September
30, 2015, a decrease of $215,217, or 33%. The decrease is attributable primarily to a decrease in exploration technologies.  

The
following table presents the composition of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Cost
of Revenue and Gross Profit   

  Our
cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was $422,294, or 98% of revenues, compared to $609,606, or 95%
of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The overall decrease in our cost of revenue is primarily due to a
decrease in Depreciation.  

The
following table presents the composition of cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Due
to limitations with the pool of qualified individuals, we utilized the services of subcontractors to assist us in providing timely
and quality service to our customers. We will continue our efforts to attract employ and retain qualified individuals to serve
the needs of our customers.  

Operating
Expenses   

  For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, our operating expenses totaled $333,208 as compared to $472,577 in 2015, representing
a decrease of $139,369, or 29.49%. The largest components of our operating expense for 2016 consist of salaries and wages and
professional services. Salaries and wages for general and administrative personnel was $119,442 for the three months ended September
30, 2016, compared to $178,439 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $58,997, or 33.06%. Professional services
expense decreased from $62,652 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, to $51,075 for the three months ended September
30, 2016, a decrease of $11,577, or 18.48%. The decrease is primarily a result of a decrease in legal fees.  

Other
Income and Expense   

  Other
income and expense consists of investment income, interest expense, and gains and losses from the sale and disposal of assets.
Other expense, net, totaled $290,474 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to other expense, net, of $16,985,
for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $273,489 or 1,610.18%. This increase is primarily due to accrued
interest on current notes payable.  

Interest
expense totaled $290,051 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $4,074 for the three months ended September
30, 2015, an increase of $285,977, or 7,016%. Interest expense pertains primarily to amounts due to affiliates as well as to our
notes payable with third parties.

the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Revenues   

  Our
revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $1,286,190, compared to $1,793,615, for the nine months ended September
30, 2015, a decrease of $507,425, or 28.29%. The decrease is attributable primarily to a decrease in manufacturing.  

The
following table presents the composition of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Cost
of Revenue and Gross Profit   

  Our
cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $1,154,972, or 89.8% of revenues, compared to $1,865,631, or
104% of revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The overall decrease in our cost of revenue is primarily due to
a decrease in Depreciation.  

The
following table presents the composition of cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Due
to limitations with the pool of qualified individuals, we utilized the services of subcontractors to assist us in providing timely
and quality service to our customers. We will continue our efforts to attract employ and retain qualified individuals to serve
the needs of our customers.  

Operating
Expenses   

  For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our operating expenses totaled $843,423 as compared to $1,311,475 in 2015, representing
a decrease of $468,052, or 35.69%. The largest components of our operating expense for 2016 consist of salaries and wages and
other costs. Salaries and wages for general and administrative personnel was $301,221 for the nine months ended September 30,
2016, compared to $527,749 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $226,528, or 42.92%. Other expenses decreased
from $188,932 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, to $142,443 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease
of $46,489, or 24.61%.  

Other
Income and Expense   

  Other
income and expense consists of investment income, interest expense, and gains and losses from the sale and disposal of assets.
Other expense, net, totaled $1,012,591 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to other income, net, of $2,383,210,
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $2,683,595 or 112.60%. This is primarily the result from Income from
Lawsuits settled. Interest expense totaled $298,203 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $13,600 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $284,603, or 2,092.67%. Interest expense pertains primarily to amounts due
to affiliates as well as to our notes payable with third parties.  

Capital
Resources and Liquidity   

  As
of September 30, 2016, we had $84,399 in cash and cash equivalents. Our cash outflows have consisted primarily of expenses associated
with our operations. These outflows have been offset by the timely inflows of cash from our customers for sales that have been
made. We have been able to utilize our relationships with affiliated entities to stabilize our liquidity needs.  

We
believe we can satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months only with our current cash and additional loans. However,
completion of our plan of operation is subject to attaining adequate revenue. We cannot assure investors that adequate revenues
will be generated. In the absence of our projected revenues, we may be unable to proceed with our plan of operations. Even without
adequate revenues within the next twelve months, we still anticipate being able to continue with our present activities, but we
will require financing to potentially achieve our growth goals.  

In
the event we are not successful in reaching our initial revenue targets, additional funds may be required, and we may not be able
to proceed with our business plan for the development and marketing of our core services. Should this occur, we would likely seek
additional financing to support the continued operation of our business.  

ITEM 3.   
       QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK.    

We
do not hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in any hedging activities.  

ITEM 4.   
       CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    

a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls. Our management evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
the end of our first fiscal quarter 2014 pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act. Disclosure controls and
procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to our management, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation,
management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016.  

It
should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can
be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.  

(b)
Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting. Our management team will continue to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting
in 2016 as we implement our Sarbanes Oxley Act testing.  

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings   

In
the ordinary course of our business, we are, from time to time, subject to various legal proceedings, including matters involving
employees, customers, and suppliers. We may enter into discussions regarding settlement of claims or lawsuits, and may enter into
settlement agreements, if we believe settlement is in the best interest of our stockholders. We do not believe that any existing
legal proceedings or settlements, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our financial condition, results
of operations, or liquidity.
